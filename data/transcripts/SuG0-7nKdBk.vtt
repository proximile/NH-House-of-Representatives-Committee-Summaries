over the weekend that she has a
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
gets out of that meeting
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
which could be around 10 30. i'm mocking
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
a present now
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay so the purpose of our meeting this
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
morning is to
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
discuss a couple of senate bills to
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
which we
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
are likely to make amendments the
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
calendar notice or the house scheduling
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
notice sent out by
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee assistant morris stated that
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
it would be just on senate bill 91 but
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
we're actually going to also talk about
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
senate bill 78 this morning as well as
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
mr chair do we have a problem getting
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem uh i don't know
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh if she has a problem or not it's it's
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
hard to tell at this point
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%

okay for her audio yeah like
 
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 align:start position:0%

i'd like to talk about uh senate bill
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
78 but before we do that
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
i need to alert the committee and have a
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
brief discussion
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
the senate concurs with the house of
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
representatives in the passage of the
 
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.910 align:start position:0%
representatives in the passage of the
following

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
in the passage of which amendments the
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
senate asks the concurrence of the house
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
of representatives
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
the bill in question is house bill 315
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the senate modified this bill
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
twice they modified it in committee
 
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
by adding the language of senate bill
 
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.670 align:start position:0%
by adding the language of senate bill
10109

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
10109
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
and the language of senate bill 109 is
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
to the language in house bill 106
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
which is a bill that we retained
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's a slightly um
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
paired down version of what was in house
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill 106 but
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
the portion that they kept was the
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
municipal host
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
the second amendment that the senate
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
added was a floor amendment that they
 
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.509 align:start position:0%
added was a floor amendment that they
added

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
and the second amendment added
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
the language that's at the tail end
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
under utility property tax exclusion
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason reason they added that to
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
because it goes along with senate bill
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
109 which they previously added
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
to house bill 315
 
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
to house bill 315
[Music]

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
utility property tax exemptions
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the entirety of the
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
changes that they made to house bill
 
00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:54.389 align:start position:0%
changes that they made to house bill
3-315

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
my inclination would be to concur with
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
these changes but i would like to hear
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
from other members of the committee
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
to hear what your opinions might be
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
on this question of concurrence
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.430 align:start position:0%
and certainly before i uh could vote to
uh

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
to concur okay what i suggest you do in
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
that case
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
is go to the general court website
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
and look up senate bill 109
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
sb 109 you can there read the text
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
that the senate
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
has attached to house bill 315.
 
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.590 align:start position:0%
has attached to house bill 315.
[Music]

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then the second part is the language
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's at the
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
end of senate bill 91
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
which we have before us today so those
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
are the two amendments that they
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
added to hb 315.
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
have you ever like to have an
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read them and consider
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
them before we
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
move to a concurrence vote
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to ask for a vote on
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
concurrence i just want to get
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
people's opinions thank you decision is
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately mine
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
but um i would like to hear what other
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
people have to say
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
you're recognized yes i'm sorry if i'm
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
being very concrete here but i am
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
looking at senate bill 109 as amended by
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
and is are we taking that language
 
00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:57.670 align:start position:0%
and is are we taking that language
verbatim

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
verbatim
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
or have they altered it in order to fit
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
it into their
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
they took the language of senate bill
 
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
they took the language of senate bill
109

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
109
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
as passed by the senate and attached it
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
as an amendment to house bill 315.
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
and the second question i have i may
 
00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:19.829 align:start position:0%
and the second question i have i may
share

00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
is um we are looking at amendment four
 
00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:24.310 align:start position:0%
is um we are looking at amendment four
today

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
as part of our uh discussion and so
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
would be hard to find concurrence
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
with the amendment until we discuss it
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
no i don't think so because it's just
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax exemption
 
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.949 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax exemption
section

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think we can concur with that without
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily concurring
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
with all of part four of sb91
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay i'll trust in your judgment then
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much okay
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
you probably want to keep me muted as
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
one of the bills one of the people who
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill very
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
hard i take umbrage at the senate
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
sending something over
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh with sight unseen i asked
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
three times because i could not pull up
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
the first amended version and
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
i could not get it so
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
going back to 109 was
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
the the amendment i believe is 1294 or
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
something like that but i could
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
not get the amendment i i couldn't pull
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
it up on the
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
website i called the clerk's office
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a great great
 
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.150 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a great great
disadvantage

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
to be asking the committee
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
to concur on anything we have not been
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
able to see
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
and compare and contrast if we were in
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
the house right now we would be able to
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
go to a draw pull
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
out the bills and and look at them
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
and compare them and and make notes on
 
00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:10.309 align:start position:0%
and compare them and and make notes on
them

00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
we have not been able to do that and the
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
senate loves to go for one scoop two
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
scoops three
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
oops four scoops on the bus an ad
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
well that's the truth and at this point
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i just disagree with
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
what they've done or not i think there
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
are some problems on it
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
we haven't had a public hearing on it we
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
haven't had
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't think they've had a hearing on
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
their amendment either
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
even though it's taken from another bill
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
and apparently there's
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
problems with that amendment um i want
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
to see it i'm one of those
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
show me people so i would
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's the deadline but i
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
believe we would probably at least have
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
another week
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
to look at this and i would love to
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
look at it probably go along with it i
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
and have at least another week i even
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
asked cliff
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
amendment house bill 315 and i got no
 
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:10.789 align:start position:0%
amendment house bill 315 and i got no
answer

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
he came back with 91 and what he was
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
looking at on 91
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
so i really would like to compare
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
and contrast and have that opportunity
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
um i've spent more on printer inc this
 
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
um i've spent more on printer inc this
month

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
this year than i've ever spent because i
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
want the p
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
i want the paper in front of me i want
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
to see it
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
and it's right thank you and
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's all i can say is and if you're
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
gonna take that position
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
it's my bill and i'm going to
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
my decision i i i would take umbrage
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
with that and i don't
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't argue much but i i think we
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
be able to thoroughly vet it
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your comments let me
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh try to help everybody
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
understand how you can get access to the
 
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.190 align:start position:0%
understand how you can get access to the
language

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the amendment if you go to the build
 
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.549 align:start position:0%
of the amendment if you go to the build
docket

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
docket
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
you should be able to see where the
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
senate attached
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%

highlighted in blue in the build docket
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
and if you click on it it should bring
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
up the text of the amendment
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%

that way if you have any doubts about
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
you could agree you could accept
 
00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
or concur with this amendment to 315
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%

if you go to senate bill 91 part 4
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
and look at the last portion of that

and look at the last portion of that
bill

00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
from definition of utility property
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
the exact language that's in senate bill
 
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.950 align:start position:0%
the exact language that's in senate bill
91

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
91
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
part four about utility property tax
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
was added to this bill and the reason
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
they did that is because they were
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
not sure that senate bill 91 would pass
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
and out of our committee and so as a
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
result they wanted to make sure
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
this language got into statute so they
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
attached it as an amendment
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
to house bill 315. and does that have an
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
amendment number it must it does
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
it is 2021-1400s
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative vos i'm sorry to
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
interrupt but i can i can send those two
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
amendments around to the committee if
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
yes yes that would be helpful thank you
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
i'll do that right now
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so let me back up a
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
little bit and explain
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh before i call on representative
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
harrington explain
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
so the senate passed senate bill 109.
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
it came out of the energy and natural
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
resources committee with a five to
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
nothing vote
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
and it then went to the senate floor
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
where it passed on a 24 to nothing
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
vote at that point the senate
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
tabled the bill now why did they do that
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
they did that because they didn't want
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
the bill to come to the house
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
they want they were afraid that if it
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
came to the house
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
that we would make changes to it in the
 
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.270 align:start position:0%
that we would make changes to it in the
house

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
so they tabled the bill with the idea
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
that they would attach it to another
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
at a later date so that they could be
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
sure to get it passed
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
and in that regard they were probably
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
correct if senate bill 109 had come to
 
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
correct if senate bill 109 had come to
us

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
from the senate we probably would have
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
changed it here in the house
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
we have house bill 106 which we've
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
already discussed several times
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
and because we retained house bill 106
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
we can still make changes
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
to the language
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
that currently is now attached to house
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
so for a six or eight month period the
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
language in house bill 315 will be the
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh operable language but we can make
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
modifications to it later if we so
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
choose so that's how we got to the place
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
that we're at today and um
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
i hope that explanation helps everybody
 
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.149 align:start position:0%
i hope that explanation helps everybody
understand

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
where we're where we are so
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative harrington uh
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a comment um mr
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
jimmy let me start out by i realize it's
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
monday morning but i tell you you've got
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
me buffaloed
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh i'm still trying to figure out what
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
the hell's going on here
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
with 106 and 315 and 109 and
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
what is the actual thing that we're
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
looking to make a decision on whether we
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
agree with or not
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
and that's 315 as amended by
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
and i see three different amendments as
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate is that the final
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
thing we're looking at hb 315 as amended
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
by the senate and is uh
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
april 2021 0 7
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
4 8 8 a h
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
we're charged with making a decision
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
about whether to concur
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
or non-concur with the changes that the
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
senate made
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
okay and is there a place that we can
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
have and i think that someone said they
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
were going to do this
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
to see these in i'm assuming the first
 
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.710 align:start position:0%
to see these in i'm assuming the first
amendment

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
must have come did that come out of the
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
house the one that's dated uh
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
april 9th no okay that was all came out
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
so can we see those three amendments
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
by themselves so we can find out exactly
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
what they changed as compared to what we
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
sent over
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
because i thought 315 as we sent it was
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
well let's be clear the first amendment
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
the one on april 9th came from
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
us okay the senate the only two
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
amendments that came for the senate
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
were 1294 s and 1400
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
s okay and jen for our committee
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
researchers said that she would send
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
those two amendments
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
via email to all members of the mike
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
okay that'll be very helpful because
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
trying to follow this otherwise is
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
trying to go back and look and see what
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
was exchanged or what was changed from
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
the senate version of the house version
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of difficult to do so that'll
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
be helpful when we get them
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i appreciate that i
 
00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.350 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i appreciate that i
understand

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
that this is difficult
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
and ultimately i have to make the
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
decision on concur or non-concur
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
and as i indicated that at the beginning
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
of this conversation
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
my inclination is to concur but
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh i would appreciate hearing from
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else who has any
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
comments on this resolution
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah we've got the email from
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
but with those uh senate amendments now
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
at least i have okay well let's not
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
spend any more time on this
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
this morning since you guys want to read
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
those amendments
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh we'll talk about it again next monday
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
or tuesday when we have an exec session
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 78
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 91 and senate bill 113.
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
we will be having exec sessions on those
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
three bills
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
either next monday the 24th for next
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
tuesday the 25th
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
there is a scheduling logistics error
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
situation that i'm dealing with right
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
now and so i don't know
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
exactly when we'll be doing it but i
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
should know by the end of the
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
day today which of those two days will
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
be having the exact session
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
so for now let's turn our attention to
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 78
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i have sent everyone on the
 
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.630 align:start position:0%
and i have sent everyone on the
committee

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
um a suggested amendment
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
to sen senate bill 78
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
which keeps the language
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
of the original bill but just adds
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
to it it adds the phrase
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
except when a veto of the biennial
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
budget occurs
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
and spending reverts to a continuing
 
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
and spending reverts to a continuing
resolution

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
only then shall renewable energy fund
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures require
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
approval by the general court fiscal
 
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.950 align:start position:0%
approval by the general court fiscal
committee

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
that is the proposed amendment
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
what is the rationale for that amendment
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
well we're extremely fortunate
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
this morning to have an attendance here
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
in our committee
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
the chair of house finance division one
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative lynn ober and lynn
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative ober suggested to me
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
that this change might be necessary to
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
make this bill acceptable to the house
 
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:50.789 align:start position:0%
make this bill acceptable to the house
and

00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
i've asked representative over if she
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
could come here this morning and tell us
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
about the rationale for making this
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
change so representative over
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
if you could move over to one of these
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
i would allow you to
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
give us an explanation for why you
 
00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
give us an explanation for why you
thought

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
this language change was necessary
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
when we have a continuing resolution
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
that means that all spending that the
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
current legislature had
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
approved but the governor vetoed
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
is canceled and it reverts to
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
what is known as the previous biennium
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
or the continuing resolution continues
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
everybody has been operating for the
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
last two years
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
this year for example we passed a budget
 
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.149 align:start position:0%
this year for example we passed a budget
that's

00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
lower with tax cuts that's gone to the
 
00:28:59.200 --> 00:28:59.909 align:start position:0%
lower with tax cuts that's gone to the
senate

00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
but should that fail and we would revert
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
we would revert to a budget that spends
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
a great deal more money
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
with no tax cuts every agency would like
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
to have all of their
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
money so that nobody can tell them how
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
to spend it
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
if you put it into a dedicated fund
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
which this does and we do that a lot
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
and then you say it is continually
 
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.630 align:start position:0%
and then you say it is continually
appropriated

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
you do not know or have any control over
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
how that money is being spent
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
but if you use the amendment that the
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
chairman suggested
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
when there is a continuing resolution
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
any agency that wants to spend above and
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
beyond what was in the previous
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
budget i.e not in the continuing
 
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.990 align:start position:0%
budget i.e not in the continuing
resolution

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
must come to fiscal committee explain
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
their project justify why it needs to be
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
done now
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
and get the approval and there are a lot
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
of agencies that do that now for example
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
parks programs under construction are
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
normally done in the summer we have a
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
hard time constructing up here in the
 
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
hard time constructing up here in the
winter

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
winter
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
so if the budget fails and we have for
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
example a million dollars worth
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
of improvements in two of our parks that
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
are needed in the coming year for safety
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
and expansion for people
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
they could not do that but they could
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal and say
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
here's our proposal here's the money
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
we'd like approval to go ahead
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
so if you use this amendment you give
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
the continued right to control spending
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
until a budget passes finance has been
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
starting to put this kind of language
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
into many of the dedicated funds
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
that exist today thank you mr chairman
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative over i have a
 
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative over i have a
question

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
if the money that goes into the
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
does not come from the budget but
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments that the
 
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.990 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments that the
utilities

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
make when they can't buy renewable
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
energy credits
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
does that make a difference no it
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't we should really be controlling
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
whatever spending
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
is going on during our biennium
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
even if we do not have access to a
 
00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:22.950 align:start position:0%
even if we do not have access to a
budget

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
you don't know what was in the previous
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
one previous budgets can spend money
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
out of every dedicated fund if they want
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
you simply put that section into house
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
and you have suspended the law if the
 
00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:38.549 align:start position:0%
and you have suspended the law if the
veto

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
veto
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
of the budget is made then the old house
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
bill 2 which suspends the law
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
continues so there are a lot of things
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
that can go on
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
that may not be what you expected to
 
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.269 align:start position:0%
that may not be what you expected to
have

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative harrington
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um and thank you
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
lynn for uh stepping in here today this
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
has been very helpful
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
question for you though the um if it
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
talks about when a veto of the biennial
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
budget occurs what if there's just a
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
budget isn't passed
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
because it comes up for a vote and we
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
don't get a majority vote
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
does that need to be addressed as well
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
it would seem like would fit into the
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
same circumstances of the veto
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah if the budget doesn't pass mike you
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
are correct it would go to a continuing
 
00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:28.230 align:start position:0%
are correct it would go to a continuing
resolution

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know is how the majority party
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
ever goes to the floor
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
when you're coming up to for the final
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
vote on the budget without a continuing
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
resolution in their pocket
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
because you cannot simply do things like
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
close the state hospital and kick all
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
the people on the street and
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
kick all the neighbors off say no you
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
can't get your car registered no you
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
can't renew your driver's license you
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
have to have a way to continue
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
basic functions that are going on in the
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
state that we all rely on
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
i i guess my question is does this need
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be addressed would we have to say
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
accept when a
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
is this says when a veto and it reverts
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
to a contingency
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
i hear would you say i didn't actually
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
write that language
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
your point is correct i would think
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
since this is the chairman's language
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
that is up to him whether he wants to do
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
or just when there is a veto so your
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
point is correct if it said if a budget
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
didn't pass
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
whether it be a veto or a lack of vote
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
you would take care of it but the
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
chairman could also write an amendment
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
this way
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
that it would affect only a veto so this
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
is his language not mine
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for clarifying that
 
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.230 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for clarifying that
point

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington that would
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
seem to indicate that
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
some additional language would be
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
necessary here so we'll
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'll make a note of that one other thing
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
i should point out
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
well no i'll point that out later
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts you're
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
representative oba i'm a very simplistic
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
thinker so when this amendment passes
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
does it change anything does it still
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
allow the fiscal committee
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
to spend the money in the energy fund
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
whatever way it wants which it would do
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
anyway if we didn't have this particular
 
00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.669 align:start position:0%
anyway if we didn't have this particular
amendment

00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
it allows that's a good question but it
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
allows the fiscal committee not to spend
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
it any way they want
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
but to reply positively to the agency
 
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:34.069 align:start position:0%
but to reply positively to the agency
request

00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
so you have that control whether you say
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
it or not but the fiscal committee
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
cannot write its own proposal to spend
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
it only reply it only responds
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i again i i may i clarify
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead again so that my
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
my brain under wraps around this
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
this money we have no budget this law
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
goes away until we do have a budget
 
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.630 align:start position:0%
goes away until we do have a budget
correct

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then without a budget
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
if there's money in the energy fund
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
could we
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
take that money for instance or could
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
take what they believe is excess or
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
money that's not committed and use it
 
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:30.950 align:start position:0%
money that's not committed and use it
say

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
for education no they cannot they cannot
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
write their own proposal
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
so they can only use it for energy they
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
can only respond to the agency request
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
and i assume the agency would
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
only ask to spend it on energy
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
samsuche is recognized for a question
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
um i just want to ask you whether
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
you believe that this this language here
 
00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:04.069 align:start position:0%
you believe that this this language here
helps

00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
helps
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
us with the problem we're trying to
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
solve here we've heard
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
from uh during testimony about this that
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we have right now is
 
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:13.990 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we have right now is
that

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh projects energy efficiency and
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
are are often put on hold all of a
 
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:22.550 align:start position:0%
are are often put on hold all of a
sudden

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
sudden
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
if uh the uh once the
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
the budget year comes to an end even if
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's money in that budget
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
unless they can unless everything is
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
paperwork is completed on time
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
they have to wait till the next budget
 
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.870 align:start position:0%
they have to wait till the next budget
appropriation

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
until they can fund these projects and
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
in the meantime the energy
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
fund has money there but it was from
 
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
fund has money there but it was from
last

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
last year's appropriations and
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that the the idea be behind
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that the money that was
 
00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:00.310 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that the money that was
there

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
from last year's appropriation continued
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
to be used for this purpose
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
going forward so that businesses have a
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
predictability about
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
when there's a project that's been
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
approved that they're going to get that
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
kind of funding
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
um does this do you think this helps in
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
any way
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
alleviate that problem if the project's
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
been approved the money has already been
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
allocated so even there's no reason for
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
a project to stop
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of one year if the money's
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
been allocated this would allow you
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
to have control over new projects going
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
forward in the small period of time when
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay thank you uh
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative mann is recognized for a
 
00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:45.990 align:start position:0%
representative mann is recognized for a
question

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is uh trivial
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
almost in in
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
importance but i think the uh second
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
line says this lawn
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
this non-lapsing special fund shall be
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh it deleted the sentence that that
 
00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:03.990 align:start position:0%
uh it deleted the sentence that that
just

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
the declarative sentence that stated
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the fund
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
was non-lapsing i think it should be
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
a declarative sentence a separate one
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
saying it is non-lapsing period
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh i think this sentence as it reads is
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
just assuming that it's non-lapsing it
 
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.349 align:start position:0%
just assuming that it's non-lapsing it
doesn't

00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a proper way to state
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
that it's not like a lapsing fund
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
my own opinion in terms of the english
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that comment
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine is recognized
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative ober uh
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
this is an unusual dedicated fund the
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
the monies come
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
from these it's dedicated where they
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
come from and it's dedicated where
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
we have had testimony from the agency
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
that they are in a bind because of
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
recent change to the text about
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and continually appropriated
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
the issue that you have raised with us
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
is a separate issue
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
let's leave the language alone the
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
language of the bill was
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
is fine the way it came to us
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
and we all there was consensus
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
from the from the group about it the
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
last time we discussed it
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
the the issue that you've brought about
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
this particular exceptional circumstance
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
where you might
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
not have a budget is is something else
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
to be tacked on
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
and uh it doesn't it doesn't modify
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not the money is carried
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
forward but but we have a real
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
problem with renewable energy projects
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
that they can only apply for the funding
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
at a certain time
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
and they they go forward with the
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
project and then you get to the end of
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year and the project hasn't
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
been completed and if they haven't
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
completed it
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
they don't get the money and and they
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
can't get the money
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
after in the new fiscal year either so
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
we have a very large sum sitting there
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
we have people desperate to get these
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
projects accomplished and get
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
so i i don't want to take you into any
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%

i thank you for being here and i thank
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
you for explaining the bit about the

continuing resolution it's important
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
and and we should add that but let's not
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
get involved with the lap scene and the
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
that was all settled last time we have
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%

happy to do it mr chairman i would um i
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
would point out that there is one other
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh potential change uh suggested by this
 
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.630 align:start position:0%
uh potential change uh suggested by this
amendment

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
suggest proposed amendment and that is
 
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:03.750 align:start position:0%
suggest proposed amendment and that is
it

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
adds section two
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
electrical electric renewable portfolio
 
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.829 align:start position:0%
electrical electric renewable portfolio
standards

00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 362 f colon 4
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
dash ic to read as follows c
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
hydrogen derived from biomass fuels
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
water or methane gas
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
now that language was originally in
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 113
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
and if you'll all recall during the
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing for 113
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
senator bradley suggested that senate
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill 113
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
be retained and during the public
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
hearing i asked him i said
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
should the section about hydrogen
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
derived from
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
biomass fuels water and methane be
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
extracted and put in another bill and he
 
00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:50.230 align:start position:0%
extracted and put in another bill and he
said

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes that would be appreciated
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
so what we've done or what i've done
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
with this proposed amendment is pull
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
that section out of 113
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
and added it to senate bill 78
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
i discussed this with senator bradley
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
and he said
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
that he agrees with that change so that
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
other proposed change for this amendment
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
is there any comment on that change
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none okay representative oxen
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i had anticipated we were
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
talking about 91 today and so i don't
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
have the 78 materials in front of me
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
as i recall it was just that one word
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
water that was added
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct thank you very much
 
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.230 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct thank you very much
for

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
clarifying representative sausage
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to say i think that's a
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable thing to do i agree with that
 
00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:56.829 align:start position:0%
reasonable thing to do i agree with that
too

00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
okay any further comments about
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 78 okay
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
let's move on then i would like
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
now to talk about senate bill 91.
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
likely require some amendment to the
 
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:22.470 align:start position:0%
likely require some amendment to the
language

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the first section i'd like to
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
discuss is part one
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
i sent the committee
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
copies of suggested amendment language
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
for part one
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
and part four so you all should have it
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested in hearing your
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed language most of the
 
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.829 align:start position:0%
the proposed language most of the
changes

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
involved changing phrases like
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
fair compensation etc that was
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the original language fair share
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing to a language
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
determines is is more
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable for these kinds of for this
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that language is just and reasonable
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
so you'll notice in several places in
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
in the proposed amendment we change fair
 
00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:29.510 align:start position:0%
in the proposed amendment we change fair
share

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
to just and reasonable contribution
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
or compensation justin reasonable for
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
parties just in reasonable costs
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
etc etc um
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
we had discussed those changes of the
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
last work session
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
and so i've incorporated them into this
 
00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:50.309 align:start position:0%
and so i've incorporated them into this
suggested

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
i've also added the word actual in a
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
couple of places
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
in front of transmission and
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
distribution costs
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i changed on page
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
three line nine and ten
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
the definition of electric generation
 
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.630 align:start position:0%
the definition of electric generation
equipment

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
to read that electric generation
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
equipment in this chapter means
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
any equipment that qualifies as energy
 
00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:20.390 align:start position:0%
any equipment that qualifies as energy
storage

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
as defined in rsa 74 etc
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
such equipment shall not be subject to
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
any of the requirements of section 3 of
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
this job
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that language is more precise
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of the original legislation
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
which was to exclude
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
energy storage equipment from the
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of this chapter
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
so those are the suggested proposed
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh changes
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you very much uh
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
these there there's a lot of other
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
changes in here as well there
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
um in general i think that these are
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
positive changes
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
that make a lot of sense um i'm
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
a little i i would really like to be
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
able to change lines
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
9 through 12 on the last
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
page and i think
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i did not staple my pages
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
together and so now i'm getting one page
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
from one amendment
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
with the other amendment i believe it
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
was the second one that you
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
actually you were you were just speaking
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
about the definition about
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
primary and electric generation
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
equipment primary energy
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is at the very i think it's the
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
last part of the second amendment that
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
you proposed
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
are we in the same place yes that that
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
last uh amendment change that i
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
discussed yes
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not suggesting anything
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
substantive i just find
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
the um the lines nine through 12 to be
 
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.230 align:start position:0%
the um the lines nine through 12 to be
awkward

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
awkward
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
and and difficult to read and i'm not
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
sure that our intention would be
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
completely clear
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
um if this were ever to become a matter
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
of contention
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
so i just kind of a highlight that i i
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
might come in with a proposed amendment
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
if if that seemed
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable the um the
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
the line 14 about the
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
benefit to low-income customers uh seems
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
like a a very um
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
useful change um it it again
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
it's been in the bill before but this
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
highlights it
 
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.630 align:start position:0%
highlights it
uh

00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
i think the the most important issue is
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the last time we had
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
our discussion we talked about going
 
00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:06.230 align:start position:0%
our discussion we talked about going
beyond

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
simply transmission and distribution
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
costs and
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
i remember uh representative bernardi
 
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.109 align:start position:0%
i remember uh representative bernardi
suggesting

00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
that uh or at least reiterating
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
that reliability and resiliency were
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
something that uh were of such an
 
00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:22.710 align:start position:0%
something that uh were of such an
advantage

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
that we would want to include them as
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
did you consider that when you were
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
creating this amendment
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
did you not include it because of
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
i don't see anywhere in my notes um
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
well i did send you an email with some
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
suggested language changes in
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
in that email i i actually quoted uh
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh he was summarizing our discussion at
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
the end and
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
saying that the things that we seem to
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
and did you send specific language uh
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
proposed language
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
yes and in fact you you and i had a
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
at least a bit of an email exchange
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
where i uh apologized for being late in
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
recognizing that you had um sent me a
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
an acknowledgement that you had received
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh my
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
language changes and i did receive your
 
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.549 align:start position:0%
language changes and i did receive your
email

00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
and i went over your language changes
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
with senator waters
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we both thought that some of your
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
changes were just too
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
um involved and too
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
detailed for the purposes of this
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh legislation i don't specifically
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
remember anything about
 
00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.630 align:start position:0%
remember anything about
reliability

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
the reliability and resiliency were not
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
part of any of the specific
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
texts that i had suggested they
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
it was in the um in the body of the
 
00:50:06.319 --> 00:50:07.510 align:start position:0%
it was in the um in the body of the
paragraph

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
we hadn't we hadn't devised a way of
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting it into the bill
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
not to restrict the bill
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
and and i must say you have language
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
here which says including
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
it perhaps if we said including but not
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
because you only have two things listed
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
sorry somebody uh just distracted me
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
what line specifically are we looking at
 
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.510 align:start position:0%
what line specifically are we looking at
now

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh this i believe we're in this are we
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
in the same place
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
on page 3 i believe at least the way it
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
um okay the line about electric
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
generation equipment
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
in this chapter means is that online no
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
no i i don't think we're there
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's the why it's the page that
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
starts with the header
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
customer energy storage
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually peter i i was in error i
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
believe the point is right at the very
 
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.790 align:start position:0%
believe the point is right at the very
beginning

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
on lines one through three
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
for behind the meter storage the rules
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
or orders shall allow for bring your own
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
device peak reduction program
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
a new language the commission may
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
approve mechanisms for a utility to
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
compensate such
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
projects for the value they actually
 
00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:53.510 align:start position:0%
projects for the value they actually
provide

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
including and then there's a substantial
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
amount struck out
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
so including any transmission or
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
distributional costs
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
actually avoided because of the
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
non-utility energy storage
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
project to the extent practicable based
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
on determinable cost
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
components so my suggestion here is
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
simply adding
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
rather than get into a lengthy
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
discussion about how we might get
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
resiliency and reliability
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
in here even though those were issues
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
that we discussed
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
last time and we seem to have arrived at
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay i've made a note of that um that
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
seems like a reasonable
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
change thank you very much thank you
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative callie pitts
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i'm just actual
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
transmission costs how do you quantify
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
what is being proposed
 
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
reliability how do you declare the
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
reliability of
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
the sun for storage or the
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't understand that we're
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
going with concrete here we're going
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
with limited
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
why are we expanding it all of a sudden
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
to generalities
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
um i i don't
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
i don't buy that all right i can't i
 
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:30.710 align:start position:0%
i don't buy that all right i can't i
can't

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
fathom that at this point how do you
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
quantify what's reliable
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
um our own grid isn't reliable
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
so how do you quantify that
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't understand that and i
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
i think that when we get into that kind
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
of a weed
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
on this particular thing we're now
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
making it more complicated than it
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
really should be
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
we can get to what actual costs are but
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
we can't get to some
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
of these things that can't be quantified
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
and i and i i think we should leave it
 
00:54:05.839 --> 00:54:07.430 align:start position:0%
and i and i i think we should leave it
alone

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you thank you for that
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
comment representative harrington is
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
recognized for comment
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh two quick
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
things first the just for the record the
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
justin reasonable
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
term that's actually not a puc creation
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's right out of uh
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
ferc rules and federal law that's where
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
it comes from so that's the appropriate
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
term to use
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
i have to agree with uh representative
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
kelly pitts on this one this
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh including actual avoided transmission
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
and distribution costs i mean that is
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
really a
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
real difficult not to crack when you're
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
talking about an individual project
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
and you're going to say that you know if
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking we're tracking
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
small fairly small customers here and
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
how much they're going to save off of
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
the billion dollar transmission system
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
because they're creating you know a few
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
megawatts somewhere
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
and is then you're going to get in the
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
time base because remember the
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
transmission is based on
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
the maximum demand for power
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
on whatever that day is in the year
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's what the transmission and
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
distribution systems are based on
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
and this i have to agree with her is a
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
very very complicated thing to try to
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
come up and assess the value to
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh we don't do it for a lot of things
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
for instance if you put in a new
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
power plant you don't get credit for the
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
transmission uh updates that didn't have
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
to get built because the power plant
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't there
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh that's that that doesn't get uh
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's just savings and transmission
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
costs the power plant builder
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't get any uh rebate saying well by
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
building this plant if we didn't put it
 
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:38.789 align:start position:0%
building this plant if we didn't put it
in

00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
we were gonna have to put in a 500
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
million dollar uh transmission system
 
00:55:42.799 --> 00:55:43.190 align:start position:0%
million dollar uh transmission system
but

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
since you put this 800 megawatt whatever
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
here uh you're going to save
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
transmission costs well
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
that's good but we're not going to pay
 
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
you anything for that so now in this
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
case we're saying well if it does do it
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
somehow we're going to pay it for them
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not only it's not consistent it
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
is incredibly difficult to try to come
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
up with i think this thing should be
 
00:55:59.599 --> 00:55:59.910 align:start position:0%
up with i think this thing should be
just

00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
left out
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that comment uh
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
um well i i gotta agree with both
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
kim representative callie pitts and
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
representing harrington about this
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
but uh on the other hand um i think the
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
the verbiage that's already there that
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
we are talking
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
i think on line 11 of the value
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
provided to the electricity system and
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
we might be able to kind of boil this
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
down to say
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
that just and reasonable compensation
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
should be provided
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
for the value provided to the
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
electricity system as determined by the
 
00:56:42.839 --> 00:56:43.990 align:start position:0%
electricity system as determined by the
commission

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh and uh representative tried to be
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
more specific about that by saying
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that includes uh other things
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
it includes the avoided transmission and
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
distribution costs but her
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
language also mentions things like
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh determinable reliability and
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
resiliency benefits
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
and uh that that sounds vague but
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
but those things are done all the time
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
when there's a reliability project
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
or a resiliency project that is
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
often justification for a project so
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's not so big
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
but i agree that we should try to strike
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
out all these uh
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
terminologies and and allow the
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
commission to determine
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
what the value of that contribution is
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
to the electric system
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we also we already say that they
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
justly and reasonably compensated for
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
the value whatever that is
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
how whatever can be determined as the
 
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.069 align:start position:0%
how whatever can be determined as the
value

00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
without us getting into the details of
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
that so we're not excluding anything but
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're allowing
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh the commission to determine what is
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
the value here
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
so representative stops that you would
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
advocate on line 10
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
striking the language including actual
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
and distribution costs yes mr chairman i
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
would suggest after justin reasonable
 
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.549 align:start position:0%
would suggest after justin reasonable
compensation

00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
i shall provide that uh for the
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
and i would take the the uh two lines
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
below it that phrase
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
for the value it provides to the
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
electricity system as determined by the
 
00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:25.510 align:start position:0%
electricity system as determined by the
commission

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
calipets okay i'm i'm gonna play the
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
devil's advocate here
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
what it what if these projects
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
are not valuable but because they become
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
so numerous
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
become a problem with intermittent power
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
and entering the grid so
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
would people then be charged
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
because there's a problem and we have
 
00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.190 align:start position:0%
because there's a problem and we have
seen

00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the proliferation of some of these
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
projects small projects have caused
 
00:59:03.359 --> 00:59:04.549 align:start position:0%
projects small projects have caused
problems

00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
that intimate intermittent electricity
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
well if we if the question is what is
 
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:17.990 align:start position:0%
well if we if the question is what is
the

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
value of that yeah electricity then
 
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.750 align:start position:0%
value of that yeah electricity then
that's

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
to be determined by the commission to be
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
that reasonable i don't know
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative occident
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh first to the point raised
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
by representative kelly pitts
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this is it deals with
 
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.190 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this is it deals with
storage

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
this is what makes intermittent power
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
not intermittent
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
this is this is this is the the great
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
step forward in technology
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
to making distributed resources more
 
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.589 align:start position:0%
to making distributed resources more
available

01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
so uh i i think you should feel
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
reassured by the fact that this is
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh promoting energy storage uh back to
 
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.069 align:start position:0%
uh promoting energy storage uh back to
the

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
to uh your discussion chairman votes
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
with um
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative samson i'm a little
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
what he said and what you said didn't
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
dovetail i don't believe and correct me
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative some such i don't believe
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
he wanted to eliminate the language
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
about avoided
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
distribution and transmission charges i
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
he his point his point was different
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
from that so i i wanted to make sure we
 
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
from that so i i wanted to make sure we
didn't

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
lose that issue um and and then the the
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
final point i wanted to make
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
was that again using a concrete example
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
if the utility is faced with a choice
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
between putting in a substation
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost 5 million rather than
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
or putting in a storage system that's
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
3 million to meet the same problem the
 
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.230 align:start position:0%
3 million to meet the same problem the
same

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
issue on their system they're saving 2
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
if they if that is the choice that is
 
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.390 align:start position:0%
if they if that is the choice that is
made

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
if they're doing this on their own
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
then then that's all handled inside of
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
their own utility
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
but if they're working with an outside
 
01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.270 align:start position:0%
but if they're working with an outside
um

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
third party the question is is there a
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
way to
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
encourage and incentivize this very
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
positive technology to be developed
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
by having a share in that value
 
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.630 align:start position:0%
by having a share in that value
apportioned

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
apportioned
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
to the third party and again this is not
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing we can determine here
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is there's a possible
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
value here
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
if the puc can determine it if it's
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
clear that there's a money value
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
then this is what we want you to do
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're saying okay
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington
 
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.029 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington
representative

01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
representatives options do you want to
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
answer her question
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
i i agree with representative oxford i
 
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
i i agree with representative oxford i
didn't

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
mean to say we should drop the phrase
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
including actual avoided transmission
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
distribution costs
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
i wanted to move that phrase of
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
for the value provided to the electorate
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
system to be moved up
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh and after compensation
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then to be and then furthermore it
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
says as determined by the commission
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
including that okay i get it
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you now representative hamil
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
harrington you're up
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yeah just to
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
reiterate the obviously cost effective
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
storage is the uh
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
it's the golden uh spike if you will
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for if we
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be obviously been going
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
forward with a lot of intermittent power
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's solar or wind
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
and this is the thing that makes it work
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
much better
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
so we obviously cost effective storage
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
is a is a big plus
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
it's a game changer uh just to put these
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
things in perspective when we're talking
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
about transmission costs and
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
just so i think maybe people uh get a
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
better handle of how this is done
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
when a project comes up through iso new
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
england a reliability project
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
they put in a preliminary estimated
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
budget and then they use that to see if
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
the project
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
is justified going through a process
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately that goes down to ferc and
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
ferc approves that
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
now what the first thing they file the
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
transmission company is with ferc is
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
regardless what happens to this project
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
once it's approved
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
all reasonable costs all prudent costs
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
will be funded
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
to the transmission company even if the
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
project gets cancelled and never gets
 
01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.630 align:start position:0%
project gets cancelled and never gets
completed

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
completed
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that then ferc says yep we're going
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
to do that you're going to get them even
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
if the project's cancelled and completed
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
but here's the thing you got to remember
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
the iso new england criteria unless it's
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
changed and i don't think it has
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
is the estimate is supposed to be within
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
minus 50 percent to plus 200 percent
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you an example of one of
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
the largest projects ever done in new
 
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
the largest projects ever done in new
england

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
england
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
which was southwest connecticut phase
 
01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.430 align:start position:0%
which was southwest connecticut phase
two

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
it came in at about almost to the penny
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
200 percent over the original estimate
 
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.750 align:start position:0%
200 percent over the original estimate
so

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
making this out as some kind of an exact
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
science where someone's going to say
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right if you put in this storage
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
system here
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to save us x amount of
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
dollars on transmission
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's a kind of a myth because
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
no one has any clue as to how much that
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
transmission is actually going to cost
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
when you have a procedure when you have
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
a policy that says minus 50
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
to plus 200 percent and i got to tell
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
you i've never seen the minus 51 but
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
i've seen a hell of a lot of plus 200
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
projects it's just isn't that an exact
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
the science
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
um can can you hear me uh hang on a
 
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.309 align:start position:0%
um can can you hear me uh hang on a
second

01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
actually actually i need to recognize
 
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.510 align:start position:0%
actually actually i need to recognize
representative

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
first sure thank you i find it ironic
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
we encourage uh distributed resources
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
generation which may have a deleterious
 
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.029 align:start position:0%
generation which may have a deleterious
effect

01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
on the system reliability and
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
and uh resilience and
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
and don't hit them with any cost for
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
that but now we want
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
some people want to try to compensate
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
storage to offset
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
the bad stuff that's occurring with
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
distributed resources
 
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
i just find a dichotomy they were
 
01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
i just find a dichotomy they were
thinking

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
um and with respect to representative
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
harrison's point about transmission what
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
he said was true in a planning estimate
 
01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:45.109 align:start position:0%
he said was true in a planning estimate
only

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
when it gets down to the point of
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
production they're a lot closer than
 
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.710 align:start position:0%
production they're a lot closer than
that

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay now representative
 
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:55.829 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay now representative
oxford

01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
oxford
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chairman just to clarify
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
that that's what
 
01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
fred said is is correct but that's
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
the point of approval is using the
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
planning estimate and once it's been
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
approved if they get more exact as they
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
go along
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
but they're already going to get all the
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
prudent costs that's the point i was
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative occident
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes and and can you hear me yes no
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i i think the point
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
here is not
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
at least my understanding of of this
 
01:06:28.559 --> 01:06:29.510 align:start position:0%
at least my understanding of of this
text

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
text
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
was that this these are costs that are
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
determined after the fact
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
the utility comes before the puc and
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
says we spent
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
x this was our thinking we could have
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
done that but we did
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
this these are actuals
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
they're not working prospectively
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're working
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
on the the what's the word the
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
repayment getting approval
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
so they know what they're called all
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay i think uh i think we've gone over
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
everything we need to cover on that
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment we'll have a couple
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
of changes coming
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
before we see the final amendment so
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
with the remaining
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
50 minutes we have for this uh
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
this session let's talk about
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
part four this is the limited energy
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
limited electrical energy producers
 
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.230 align:start position:0%
limited electrical energy producers
section

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 91
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
and this is the section
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
provides us with the most difficulty i
 
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.390 align:start position:0%
provides us with the most difficulty i
think

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
because there is still some question
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
in my discussion with a lot of people
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
about whether
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
any of this is in fact
 
01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.349 align:start position:0%
any of this is in fact
legal

01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
allow the honorable clifton below to
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
speak and i'm going to ask
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
mr bilo if you could answer a couple of
 
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.070 align:start position:0%
mr bilo if you could answer a couple of
questions

01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
to help us understand if this
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
actually can be done legally or not
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
the first question i want to ask
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
is if you look at page two of the
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
starting at line 14 it says
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
that the limited producers shall receive
 
01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.669 align:start position:0%
that the limited producers shall receive
credit

01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
etc etc etc but i'm still not
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
clear who provides
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
those credits so mr bilo could you
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
answer that question for me
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
sure thank you mr chairman um
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
essentially what what this overall
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
section does
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
is clarify
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
the state jurisdiction over distributed
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
generation and storage that is not
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
participating in iso new england markets
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
and sort of under the federal state
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
overall scheme
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
um there's there's not supposed to be
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
any gaps in regulation
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
and under the federal power act and the
 
01:09:28.239 --> 01:09:28.630 align:start position:0%
and under the federal power act and the
ferc

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
ferc
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
and supreme court interpretations of it
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
they say very clearly the state has
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over retail
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
sales of electricity as well as within
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
state wholesale
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
so within state wholesale sales sell to
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
another party for resale
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
only occurs for generation which is not
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
subject to ferc uh jurisdiction so that
 
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.269 align:start position:0%
subject to ferc uh jurisdiction so that
that's

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
all we're dealing with here stuff that
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
is by its nature state jurisdictional
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
the transmission credit um would come
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
from what's called the transmission cost
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
adjustment mechanism
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
it is in effect part of retail rates not
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
the wholesale rates
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
the transmission owners and iso new
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
england would continue to charge the
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities transmission
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
service costs based on their share of
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
the monthly
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
annual up not monthly monthly not annual
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
on the monthly coincident peak because
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
the transmission charges
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
are actually parceled out for the whole
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
year uh based on
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
a single hour of peak demand in each
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
month of the year
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
and so um the the the
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
the in essence the revenue comes because
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
all customers are paying two and a half
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
cents a kilowatt hour
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
roughly for transmission it's a flat per
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour rate even though the
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
underlying cost
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
is based on share of coincident peak so
 
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
is based on share of coincident peak so
so

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know it by its nature some customers
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
have more of that
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
peak demand and others less but everyone
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
gets charged the same amount and to my
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
mind that's a deficiency
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
in not providing an appropriate price
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
signal that that generation
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
or storage that's on system peak is much
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
more valuable than
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
system generation or storage that is
 
01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:10.630 align:start position:0%
system generation or storage that is
off-peak

01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
off-peak
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
for instance so just as a as a mechanism
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
it recognizes that
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay if you've got one megawatt that is
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
generated locally
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
and is used to offset load locally
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
um then that is one megawatt that you do
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
not have to buy from the transmission
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
over the transmission grid from bulk
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
larger generators under iso under first
 
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.070 align:start position:0%
larger generators under iso under first
jurisdiction

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
so um that is in its nature
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a state regulated transaction
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
and the state
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
only the puc only has to ensure that the
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
tr that the distribution companies get
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursed the full
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
amount of the transmission charges that
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
go to them through whatever mechanism
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
so so if for instance a one megawatt uh
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
distributed generator limited producer
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
under this statute not participating in
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
was producing one megawatt for every
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
um hour on every coincident peak hour of
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
every month of the year for
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
instance um which is unlikely you know
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to vary by month and if
 
01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.390 align:start position:0%
they're going to vary by month and if
it's

01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
solar or even with solar with storage
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
maybe not so much in the wintertime
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
but it would it would be avoiding
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of about a hundred and thirty
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
dollars per kw
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
of that capacity that is not being
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
charged to the distribution utility
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
and instead they could be compensated
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
in effect 95 or less of that i say 95
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
or less because it's based on its output
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
before accounting for
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
transmission and transformation and line
 
01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.270 align:start position:0%
transmission and transformation and line
losses

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
losses
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
and there's further language in here
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
that if there's any issue about any
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
cross subsidy or cost shifting that the
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
commission could reduce that to a lower
 
01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
commission could reduce that to a lower
percentage

01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh but the basic point is if we don't
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
have this kind of generation in the one
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
to five megawatt range in the storage
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
then and we get that from the bulk
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
system we will pay
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
the hundred and thirty dollars per kw
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
per year
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh for you know our on our based on
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
our peak demands
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
if we can shave that peak demand then
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
there is a true avoided cost
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's actually quite discernible it is
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
the basis for liberty utilities
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
battery pilot which they're doing and
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
this simply
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
says let's that make make the same
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
principle that's being applied by the
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
puc with liberty utilities
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
make that same principle apply to a
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
a a a third party owned battery storage
 
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.669 align:start position:0%
a a a third party owned battery storage
system

01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
or generator that can produce on peak
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
most solar
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
does not produce on that peak so the
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
idea that this will give a lot of
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
compensation to bare solar is not likely
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
unless the solar is designed to produce
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
on the monthly system coincident peak
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
which in the winter time is after dark
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
so this really
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
provides the point is to provide an
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate price signal which is to say
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
if you can reduce our cost from what
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
they would otherwise be
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
by x amount then you get 95 or less of
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
that x amount
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
and the rest of that savings could go to
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
other customers
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
so that that's a long answer to a short
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
was a very long answer but what i
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
understood from that answer
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
is that there would definitely be
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
some kind of cost shifting no
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
because because the customer the retail
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
customer would still be
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
paying the exact same amount they're
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
paying for transmission now
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's just that they would pay most of it
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
to the transmission provider
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
in effect a small part of it would go to
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
a limited producer
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
that actually avoids that transmission
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
cost so
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's sort of a but four if
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
if you think we're going to get one to
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
five megawatt
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
limited producers without such a credit
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
then that that might be true they would
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
be producing savings that they're not
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
getting credit for
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
but i think it's unlikely we're going to
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
get that um
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
and instead we're going to see a push to
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
expand net metering which
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
overcompensates in one realm
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
generation and under compensates in
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
another realm
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
which is not giving credit for avoided
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
but the first part of that lengthy
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
sentence you said
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
that customers will still pay
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
the transmission charges to their
 
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.910 align:start position:0%
the transmission charges to their
utility

01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
utility
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
but the limited producer
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
will pay slightly less than that so
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
that has them yes no they won't
 
01:15:36.719 --> 01:15:38.950 align:start position:0%
that has them yes no they won't
necessitate

01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
necessitate
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
no no because the limited producer
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
the limited producer only gets credit
 
01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
the limited producer only gets credit
for

01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
the actual charges that they have helped
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
reduce or eliminate
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
and and in the long run there's value to
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
this because
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
um you are avoiding or you know the ins
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
the structural incentive would be to
 
01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:01.669 align:start position:0%
the structural incentive would be to
shift

01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
shift
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
shave the peak the coincident peak
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
demand which
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know the more people do that the
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
wider the target becomes in terms of the
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
number of hours you need to perform
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh to achieve that reduction um
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
and if you can do so then that actually
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
helps avoid the need to
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
have expensive more new transmission
 
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.430 align:start position:0%
have expensive more new transmission
investment

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't need it to serve
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
that load uh it would be served locally
 
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.390 align:start position:0%
that load uh it would be served locally
instead

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
instead
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
just like energy efficiency or
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
or load shifting um well load shifting
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it because you would pay
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
you pay regardless of when when you
 
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.709 align:start position:0%
you pay regardless of when when you
consume

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
right so the second question about
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
this whole issue is if the transmission
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
and distribution grids
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
are so tightly integrated
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
is it going to be possible to determine
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
or to segregate avoided transmission
 
01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:02.709 align:start position:0%
or to segregate avoided transmission
charges

01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
charges
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
from charges
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
i i think yes because it's quite
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
discreet it's it's
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's about 11 per kw per month
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
and it's a simple measurement the uh
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
distribution utility gets a bill based
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
on what their network load is
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
at that hour of system peak this
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
only gives credit if the if the
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
discharge to the grid either from
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
generation or storage
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
actually occurs at that hour of system
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
peak and just like liberty
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
calculates how much their batteries are
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
saving each month
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh because they figure out how much
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
they've actually discharged the
 
01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.430 align:start position:0%
they've actually discharged the
batteries

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
batteries
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
at the system peak in the same manner
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know the same calculation occurs and
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
says okay you've got
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
one megawatt that you produced on system
 
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.189 align:start position:0%
one megawatt that you produced on system
peak

01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
peak
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
that lowered our transmission costs by
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
1.05 megawatts or 1.07
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
reduces it by 1.07 megawatts on average
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
and we would have to pay for 1.07
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
instead we'll pay you for one
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
or or less than one and
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's no cost shift there there's a
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
small savings that
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh could grow over time as we avoid
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh some transmission investments that
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
may otherwise be necessary
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
if we're getting this power from a
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
remote resource rather than
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
a very local resource you know so so
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
the two systems are integrated but there
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
is an interface between them
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
and reducing load on the distribution
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
system whether it's by
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
load curtailment energy efficiency
 
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:41.990 align:start position:0%
load curtailment energy efficiency
storage

01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
storage
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
or distributed generation all has the
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
same actual effect
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
of lowering the amount of power that has
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
to be moved over the transmission grid
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
and hence the size that that system has
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
to be built to
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay so the next question is
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
will the
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
rates that utilities
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
need to charge to recover their costs
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
be affected by these limited producer
 
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.910 align:start position:0%
be affected by these limited producer
credits

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
the transmission utilities yes for
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
the distribution the transmission
 
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.390 align:start position:0%
the distribution the transmission
utilities

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
well there'll be two effects one is um
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
they'll get
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
they'll get less revenue for a
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
particular month in which this
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
um sort of reduced network load occurs
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
um that this is this is something that
 
01:19:35.679 --> 01:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
um that this is this is something that
the

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
um just last week or beginning of this
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
week the markets committee of iso new
 
01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:40.790 align:start position:0%
week the markets committee of iso new
england

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
england
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
voted 94.4 in favor of a tariff
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
clarification that
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
that makes it clear that such generation
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
would not
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
um would function to reduce the
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
calculation of network load
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
so yes the network load calculation
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
would go
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
down and the annual system peak for
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
capacity charges as well would go
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
down to the extent that we have new
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
storage or generation
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
at the system peaks um that has two
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
effects one for transmission
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
um you know combined with everything
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
else that's going on with the economy
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
with energy efficiency
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
with beneficial electrification load
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
being added to the system
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
um it might uh reduce um
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
the the um revenue uh
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
towards their revenue requirement and
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
they have a correction mechanism so in
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
theory the revenue
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh the next time they recalculate that
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
there might be a shortfall or there
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
might be an overage
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and and that will go into the
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
calculation for the next period of time
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
but it also has the longer run effect of
 
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
but it also has the longer run effect of
reducing

01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
the need for new investment in
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
transmission to some extent
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
and what we know is that new investment
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
in transmission
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
a new say you know megawatt of capacity
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
on the transmission grid
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
cost a lot more than the average
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt of capacity does today
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
so adding more transmission at to serve
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
peak loads
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
has an effect of um of of raising
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
the cost per kw of demand over time um
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
and and the other fact is if we can
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
shave these peaks
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we actually have more consumption
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
off-peak such such as a battery that
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
drop you know it's charged up off-peak
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
and discharges on peak then we're
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually potentially selling more
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours total so
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
there is a potential positive effect of
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
spreading cost over more kilowatt hours
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh without raising the peak demand which
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
will have the effect of
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative plett is recognized
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
for a question for a couple if you don't
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
mind mr chamberlain or a couple of
 
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.870 align:start position:0%
mind mr chamberlain or a couple of
questions

01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh i would ask uh
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
whether the uh
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
let's say a leap is perused let's say it
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
happens to be in lebanon
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
selling to customers and somehow that
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
does avoid
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
let's say a peak uh at the lebanon
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
interface with the eversource system
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
what happens with that transmission does
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure i understood the question
 
01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.350 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure i understood the question
um

01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
we would have to have a huge amount of
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
such distributed generation and storage
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to zero out our our
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
load at the system peak if we if we're
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
able to do it at system peak we could
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
probably do it all the time
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
and in fact in effect we will set up a
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
huge micro grid um that that that's
 
01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:39.430 align:start position:0%
huge micro grid um that that that's
we're

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know really really far off from that
 
01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.790 align:start position:0%
you know really really far off from that
um

01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know if in theory everybody produced
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
so much local power that they didn't
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
need transmission that that's true
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
the in the transmission system would
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
still cost money but
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
i think the trend is the opposite
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's a big push
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh to increase electrification of
 
01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.110 align:start position:0%
uh to increase electrification of
vehicles

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
and um heating with heat pumps and such
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh so i think we're likely to continue
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
to see growth and load the question is
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
do we manage the peak uh demand or not
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
so so that we can kind of lower the cost
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
hour or or if we don't have the price
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
signals in place
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
like like we we don't have it with
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
regular net metering
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
um uh there's no time differential on
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
the kilowatt hours in that metering
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh so if you don't have some price
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to recognize there's value
 
01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:35.110 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to recognize there's value
just

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
to reducing peak demands then
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
then we potentially will drive up the
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
cost per kilowatt hour for everyone
 
01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.030 align:start position:0%
cost per kilowatt hour for everyone
because

01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
people don't care whether they're adding
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
load on peak or off peak
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's there's no financial signal for
 
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.870 align:start position:0%
it's there's no financial signal for
that

01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question is whether what
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of transmission is simply
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
delivery of uh power to uh
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
distribution system or are there other
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
intents for that transmission
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
such as voltage regulation frequency
 
01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.629 align:start position:0%
such as voltage regulation frequency
regulation

01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
etc oh yes i mean
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
most of our power like you know probably
 
01:24:12.639 --> 01:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
most of our power like you know probably
99

01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
99
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
of it comes from these bulk generators
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
that are part of
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
iso ferc regulated ice new england
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
market and and they can provide those
 
01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:21.990 align:start position:0%
market and and they can provide those
services

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
um typically uh battery storage
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
can also provide those services they can
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
do voltage regulation power factor
 
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
do voltage regulation power factor
correction

01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
correction
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh things like that with with smart
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
inverters uh so potentially
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
and distribution utilities have to do
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
some of that on their distribution grid
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
with capacitors and such these
 
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:43.990 align:start position:0%
with capacitors and such these
additional

01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources can
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
actually be used to help
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
manage and improve power quality on the
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative harrington you have a
 
01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.229 align:start position:0%
representative harrington you have a
question

01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
your hand is up
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
all right we'll come back to that uh
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
have a question or a comment
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative occident you're
 
01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
okay representative occident you're
recognized

01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr velo
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think i'm sorry i'm going i'm going to
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
not ask the question i think it would
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
take us
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
into a a different rabbit hole that
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
might not be
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
as productive as i originally thought
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me okay thank you
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington are you
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
i guess not all right i'm going to throw
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
out a different
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion and that is i'm sorry i had
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
my just forgot to take my hand down
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
which i will do now
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you uh
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
all right before i toss out my
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion i'll recognize
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
while we have cliff here i'm i'm i'm
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
really concerned cliff about the
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
about the uh resiliency of the of the
 
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:32.550 align:start position:0%
about the uh resiliency of the of the
grid

01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
grid
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the possible cyber jacks on the grid
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
lower that or do you need that
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
that ability perhaps to
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
or do you need batteries to operate
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
the electricity to operate that storage
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
mechanism representative callie pitts
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to respectfully
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
ask you to withdraw that question since
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's not really relevant to the
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh bill that we're discussing the
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
section of the legislation that we're
 
01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.390 align:start position:0%
section of the legislation that we're
discussing

01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
could you take that question offline
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
with uh mr b
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
cliff could you answer that by email for
 
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.310 align:start position:0%
cliff could you answer that by email for
me

01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
is he going sure will do yes by email
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's true okay thank you so
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
the suggestion i'm going to toss out is
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
given the uncertainty
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
around the issues raised by this
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
legislation how would the committee feel
 
01:27:38.639 --> 01:27:39.189 align:start position:0%
legislation how would the committee feel
about

01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
creating a study committee to study this
 
01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:42.470 align:start position:0%
creating a study committee to study this
issue

01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
to come up with a proposal that
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be to seems that can deal with
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
vagueness and the unanswered questions
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
that we seem to have about this bill
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's my proposal and i'd like to hear
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
including you representative milo
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think we've studied it to death and we
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
should push it forward
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
we have a situation where the puc is
 
01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.149 align:start position:0%
we have a situation where the puc is
currently

01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
examining the storage issue and they are
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
well along in their deliberations
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
i think possibly retaining
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
the bill and let's see what the puc
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
tells us they think they can do
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
which was in fact the upshot of the
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
of the previous legislation that was
 
01:28:41.679 --> 01:28:43.910 align:start position:0%
of the previous legislation that was
passed

01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you for that suggestion
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
but since this is an omnibus bill with
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
five parts to it i'm not sure we could
 
01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
five parts to it i'm not sure we could
retain

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:51.730 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:52.790 align:start position:0%
retain
[Music]

01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
one part i think we'd have to retain the
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
entire bill
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you mr chair
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
the awards wording you have there now is
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
just unreasonable
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
i think the commission can figure out
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
just unreasonable
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
and there may be a lot of uncertainty
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
but they'll take that uncertainty into
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
account and come up with whatever they
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
all right now we're starting to confuse
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
parts one and parts
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay very good uh the justin reasonable
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
language was language we were going to
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
add to part one
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
now we're trying to figure out what to
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
do with part four which is the
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
limited electrical producer energy
 
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.750 align:start position:0%
limited electrical producer energy
producers

01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
producers
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
section and i'd like to hear mr bilo
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
comment on whether or not you think that
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
we could obtain any additional
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
information by creating a study
 
01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.510 align:start position:0%
information by creating a study
committee

01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
um i i think you could um
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
create a study committee to look at how
 
01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:58.709 align:start position:0%
create a study committee to look at how
to

01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
update rsa 362 a2a this whole section
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
about limited producers
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
um another another idea that i'll just
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
throw out
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
is uh you could um make
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
the enactment of part four uh
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
effective put it off until january one
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
of next year
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
and say that the commission that that
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh under it shall not be effective
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
before july 1
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
of next year uh and then also set up the
 
01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
of next year uh and then also set up the
study

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh to take a another look at
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
it and then you
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
have plenty of time to introduce and
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
pass legislation before
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
any implementing rules become effective
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
to modify
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
or clean it up or um or repeal it for
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
that matter
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
but but i guess my concern is you've got
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
this house rule
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
that um language that was ital'd in the
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
first year of the session
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
can't be uh taken up in the second year
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
and and you've already killed two bills
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
that are somewhat similar
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh so so i guess that's my concern in in
 
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh so so i guess that's my concern in in
suggesting

01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
maybe a uh enactment that's delayed
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh by enough to give time for study
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee to review it
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
um but yes i mean i i do think you
 
01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:15.990 align:start position:0%
um but yes i mean i i do think you
probably

01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
benefit from people understanding this
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay good thanks for that uh
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for that suggestion although i
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
think the senate could refile this bill
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think their rules are the same
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
as the house rules
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
that that might be possible if if we
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
change this just to a study committee
 
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam you still have
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
your hand up do you want to make another
 
01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.220 align:start position:0%
your hand up do you want to make another
comment

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:45.230 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:31:45.230 --> 01:31:49.270 align:start position:0%
comment
[Music]

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out but between the
 
01:31:59.040 --> 01:31:59.350 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out but between the
if

01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
we could retain the entire bill um
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
is there a loss to the other sections is
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
there anything that we need
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
um the question you tell me
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
part one is the energy storage piece
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
does that need to be uh that's the part
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
that we were
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
suggesting to retain was part one and
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
you said we couldn't do just part one
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
we'd have to do the entire bill because
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's an omnibus
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if what just trying to
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
think through what it would be like to
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think the suggestion was that we
 
01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.149 align:start position:0%
i think the suggestion was that we
retain

01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
or we could retain part four
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
but now you're suggesting that we retain
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
the whole bill
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a possibility
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee welcome uh i hope
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
you had a good delegation meeting
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you i'd like to hear your
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts thank you mr chairman it went
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
a lot longer than it was supposed to go
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
but it was productive
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'm you know i'm coming late
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the party here
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
and what i'm hearing is that we have
 
01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
and what i'm hearing is that we have
questions

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
on part four and since hb
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
407 was a bill that i had put in and
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
i've been in some of the conversations
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
um leading up to today i'm just curious
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
if we have clearly articulated what
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
are you're saying there's confusion
 
01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:39.750 align:start position:0%
are you're saying there's confusion
around

01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know if the bill went forward as
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
part of the omnibus
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
how uh that there might be some things
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
for which there aren't clarification and
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
some of that comes from us not having an
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
understanding about how the puc is going
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
to rule but they are
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
going to have to figure out how limited
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
electric energy producers
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
operate properly and are compensated
 
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
operate properly and are compensated
properly

01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the space so i'm just wondering if
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
we've identified in the conversation
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
what the particular
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
exceptions are uh to passing for along
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
with everything else is part of the
 
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
with everything else is part of the
omnibus

01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
omnibus
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not i wasn't paying attention to
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
exactly when you joined
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
the meeting so i don't know it wasn't
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
very long ago
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much of it you missed
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
but yes i did articulate about three or
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
four different questions
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
oh you did earlier that we discussed
 
01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:33.750 align:start position:0%
oh you did earlier that we discussed
with

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
while his answers were as as always
 
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.430 align:start position:0%
while his answers were as as always
extremely

01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
they still left me with with a few
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions so
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
what we're discussing now is the
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
creating a study committee to
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
try to come up with answers to those
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
remaining questions
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
and mr bilo's suggestion
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we just changed the effective date
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
of this act from what it says currently
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
that it'll take effect
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
60 days after its passage we could
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
change that to a year from now year and
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
a half from now
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
and also add append a study committee
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
section to the bill and
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
have the study committee try to answer
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
before the bill becomes goes into effect
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
and if the result of that study
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
committee was that the bill should not
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
go into effect
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
then we could submit legislation to uh
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
to repeal it so that's the question
 
01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:51.910 align:start position:0%
to repeal it so that's the question
we're

01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
working on at the moment
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
which i think is a reasonable
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
potentially reasonable
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
approach yeah i would agree okay
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you if we're not going to lose
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
anything on time and we're still going
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
get folks questions answered in the
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
interim then at least it continues
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
moving the ball forward
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
so i would think that would be
 
01:36:12.719 --> 01:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
so i would think that would be
reasonable

01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
the other reaction to the proposal to
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
change the date the effective date and
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
create a study committee
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation will actually do what
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's designed to do
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
without causing any distress to the
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi is recognized in
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
principle i think it's a it's a good
 
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.229 align:start position:0%
principle i think it's a it's a good
idea

01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
the day change allows us time to uh
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
to have the study committee to truly
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
understand if we need to make further
 
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
understand if we need to make further
tweaks

01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%

01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
i'll make a quick ditto
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's great uh representative um
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
pimentel is recognized for clarification
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
the date change
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
was only uh for
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
part four is that correct
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative uh samsung is recognized
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman i i also
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
agree i think this is a good solution to
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
to delay the the date um
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh to a period of time where we can
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh have a study committee look at these
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions and be able to clarify some so
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good solution you know
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative partial is
 
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.990 align:start position:0%
okay representative partial is
recognized

01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh you were asked you were
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
discussing earlier about
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
us being i'm forgive the term in
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
concordance for the senate
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill that's the
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
decision you you need to make
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
of course this would affect that uh
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
agreement would it not
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
now that that was a different bill oh
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay i thought it was a squad i do
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
apologize but i
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
i'm all wholeheartedly feeling the same
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
way then we should
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead with the study committee okay
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure about how
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
we're proceeding it's been suggested
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
that you're only talking about a study
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee for part four
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
i thought we were talking about a study
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
committee to examine the issues raised
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
in the bill because
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think there was all that much
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
confusion about section four
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
i thought that we spent most of the day
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
talking about section one
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that's the part that has more to do
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
with the um the puc
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding that so my
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that my comments were
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
germane to
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
the discussion if we're simply talking
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
you are correct we are discussing
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
section four
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
and what we specifically are discussing
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
is whether or not we should change the
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
of this section of the bill just part
 
01:39:22.239 --> 01:39:23.750 align:start position:0%
of this section of the bill just part
four

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh to a year from now or 18 months from
 
01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:27.290 align:start position:0%
uh to a year from now or 18 months from
now

01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:28.390 align:start position:0%
now
[Music]

01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then append to the legislation the
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
creation of a study committee
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
to study the issue but
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
really writing a report by the the 18th
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
of november
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
and uh that would allow us to to
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
submit subsequent legislation if it was
 
01:39:48.719 --> 01:39:50.149 align:start position:0%
submit subsequent legislation if it was
necessary

01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we had real difficulty
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
with understanding section four i think
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
the difficulty
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
and that you know people are running the
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
two together and
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
that difficulty in understanding the
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
compensation mechanisms in section one
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
section four is really quite
 
01:40:08.239 --> 01:40:11.910 align:start position:0%
section four is really quite
straightforward

01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the two are particularly
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's one of the problems with omnibus
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
bills you get
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
parts to them that are sort of related
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
but not directly related
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
and so that that leads to confusion but
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
to to answer your questions specifically
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes i think there
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
are questions about how this would work
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
that the legislation doesn't make clear
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
and many of us still have questions
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
about how this would actually work
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
so that's why we that's why we're
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
struggling with it at this point uh
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
representatives why the study committee
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
would make sense
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly that's why we're
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
debating whether to do a study committee
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
right but is it section one and four or
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
is it simply
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
section four because i said i think
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
we've allowed our difficulties
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
in one area to bleed over into the other
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
area and
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
where we where we really need a study
 
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.709 align:start position:0%
where we where we really need a study
committee

01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me where there are issues
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
that people don't seem to understand and
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
where it is complicated
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
are in a different section but that's
 
01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.109 align:start position:0%
are in a different section but that's
enough

01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
yes we're talking specifically about
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
adding a study committee
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
for section four only representative
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
mcgee yes thank you mr chair
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
and that was back to my question of what
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
were the questions because
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know that was what i wanted
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
clarification on because i don't i have
 
01:41:47.119 --> 01:41:47.990 align:start position:0%
clarification on because i don't i have
written

01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh notes on the original part four for
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
questions that came up at the time like
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
a dividing line between distribution and
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
transmission was something
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
that was brought up avoided transmission
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
costs or
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
cost shifts were brought up but i
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
i didn't think any of those were
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
many of those are the reason that the
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
bill says that the commission shall
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
initiate rulemaking
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
because they can't be known before
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're known
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
and so it's a cart before the horse
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
thing again and i would just
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
that's why i want to know what questions
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
are we trying to satisfy with the study
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
committee because it doesn't seem to me
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
like there's
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
much question beyond that it's just that
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
those questions will have to come
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
after the legislation is passed in an in
 
01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.350 align:start position:0%
after the legislation is passed in an in
another

01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
agency that's tasked with that so i
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what my question was
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
is what what are the open questions
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to resolve by not
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
letting it go forward as it
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
as it's written okay good question
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
i will send you a written summary of the
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
questions that we discussed
 
01:42:56.230 --> 01:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
before you arrive
 
01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:59.510 align:start position:0%
before you arrive

01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
your hand is still up do you have
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
no forgot again i'll take it down
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative oxenoum your hand is
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
still up you have another question
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you very much mr chair i
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
i really do
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
think it's too bad the cat wasn't here
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
but i think that she would be saying the
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
very same thing now if she had been here
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
all morning
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
what is it that is the problem because
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's and i think we all we all need to
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
understand that and and having a
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
discussion offline
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't help us in this work session to
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
get to the point
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
of saying how we want to proceed which
 
01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:40.709 align:start position:0%
of saying how we want to proceed which
is

01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know the work that we're here to do
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
so are you asking me to to re-ask the
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
questions i asked earlier
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
if if you would sir i think it would be
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
helpful to all of us
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay the questions i asked earlier
 
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.070 align:start position:0%
okay the questions i asked earlier
included

01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
a limited producer shall receive credit
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
for actual avoided transmission charges
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
credit from whom that's
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
question number one uh question number
 
01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:16.950 align:start position:0%
question number one uh question number
two

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
the transmission and distribution grids
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
are so tightly integrated
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
what's transmission versus distribution
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
can the two really be segregated
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
are there in fact avoided costs
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
and there was a fourth question that i
 
01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.070 align:start position:0%
and there was a fourth question that i
know

01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head that i can go
 
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
back and look at the
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
recording again to refresh my memory but
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of questions that i
 
01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of questions that i
think

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
a study committee committee needs to ask
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
and get concrete answers for
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
actually i think those are pretty
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward questions and
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
we might actually be able to get mr bilo
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
to answer them
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
for us well he did attempt to answer
 
01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:11.669 align:start position:0%
for us well he did attempt to answer
them

01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
but i'm not entirely satisfied with
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
those answers and i think i'm
 
01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:19.130 align:start position:0%
get another perspective
 
01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:20.709 align:start position:0%
get another perspective
[Music]

01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative of can transmission and
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
distribution costs be segregated
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
they are all the time i mean that's
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's why one's called transmission
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
costs what's called distribution costs
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know i mean the puc and the iso
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
and you know that that's that's an issue
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
again not for the legislature that's not
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
a policy issue that's that's for those
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
who deal with the technical details
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
and they do it all the time they're
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're perfectly competent to do that
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
in in terms of who should receive the
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
credit i think that's
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
something that someone on this call must
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
know i i would assume it's the puc
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
but maybe it's iso but it's again that's
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
an issue a technical issue
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
that would be worked out by the the
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
do that um and then
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
are there in fact avoiding costs
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
i mean we have a situation where iso
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
rewards people for avoided costs you
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
know that that's that's monetized that's
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's being done again this this is
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
something that the the technical people
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
who handle these issues
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
they do this i i don't think this is a
 
01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.030 align:start position:0%
they do this i i don't think this is a
reason

01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
not to proceed with what we found in in
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
our last discussion to be
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
a very positive build that should that
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
should be moving
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
forward and that there are many you know
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
we have a renewable energy industry in
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
this state we
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
we have produced we have people engaged
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
in this who are standing by
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for the legislation to enable
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
them to go forward
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
and for us to say gee i don't know if we
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
can just distinguish that
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
we don't need to what but i do think we
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
can just
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
simply have to say that we trust the
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
competence of the agencies
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
that make these decisions for us that's
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's why the puc is there that's
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
why would they have their proceedings
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
and their staff and work out the details
 
01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:15.910 align:start position:0%
and their staff and work out the details
and

01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
my god thank god they do but again i
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
these things as as as holding up going
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
forward for the bill or needing to study
 
01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:26.149 align:start position:0%
forward for the bill or needing to study
committee

01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mckee
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i think that
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
that was a point that i i tried to make
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
earlier the other thing i was thinking
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
is from the nature of the questions
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
which i'm
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for providing them is that
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
when we had the presentation
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
on how renewable energy
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
economics works and to try and get some
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
of us further along in our
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of the pricing models and
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
the and the
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
the way things are working currently in
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
our energy economy
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
um when you talk about the credit for
 
01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:05.830 align:start position:0%
um when you talk about the credit for
avoided

01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's not a credit like who pays
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
the credit
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's getting credit uh in other words
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
maybe paying a lower
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
rate because of the credit you're
 
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
bringing to the system
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
i think that's the complexity of
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
understanding it that we might not all
 
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:23.430 align:start position:0%
understanding it that we might not all
get

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
we might not all be experts on our
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee that understand
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
how that market is going to work but
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
that is that is what the rate setting
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
agency is going to determine they're
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to determine whether any
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
costs are transferred
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
and um and my understanding is from the
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
presentation that we had
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
that the value of renewables coming on
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
to the distribution grid has been priced
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
and we had that in testimony
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
has been priced at much higher than the
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
rates that are currently being paid like
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
the default rate and that sort of thing
 
01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.030 align:start position:0%
the default rate and that sort of thing
so

01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
i think we have to trust that
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
um that there is a value to people
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
generating uh energy locally and
 
01:49:04.159 --> 01:49:05.030 align:start position:0%
generating uh energy locally and
creating

01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
creating
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
additional resilience within the system
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
so that it's not
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
all dependent on one central location
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
that can be brought down just like that
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
cyber attack that we just saw that shuts
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
it down for everybody you know
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's a value and so um
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that we don't understand the
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
value i don't think should be an
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
inhibitor for us being able to allow
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
this portion of the bill
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
to go forward and that's the reason that
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
i asked the original question is because
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
section four was also straightforward
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
questions that i heard put forth were
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
from eversource's attorney
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
matt fossum and the questions that he
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
asked were sort of
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
refuted by attorneys who work in
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
in uh in the ferc field you know after
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
the fact they basically said no that's
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's not the way it works and i think
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
cliff has said it
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
in testimony to us several times so
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
there's no uh concern for
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
limited electric energy producers coming
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
online and starting to function
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
helping people to produce energy where
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
they live
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
and trying to lower costs and trying to
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
manage peak demand and trying to
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
implement storage systems
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
that stuff is all good for new hampshire
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's not going to
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's not going to affect the
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
transmission grid because the energy
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be going
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
over the transmission lines and that was
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
the point that he was trying to make
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
he's like well i don't know that ferc
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be involved
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
and i think we got the answer that
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's not true that was the only
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
question that i saw
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
or heard and i didn't see the question
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
but the only question that i heard that
 
01:50:38.239 --> 01:50:38.550 align:start position:0%
but the only question that i heard that
uh

01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
made people go back and start scratching
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
their heads like is that something we
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
have to be concerned about and i believe
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
the answer after the fact was
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
it isn't it hasn't been an issue that's
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
why this bill keeps coming back
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
in front of us and that's i think why
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
the senate put
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
it forward as well to try and make sure
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
lose another cycle so that's my spiel
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your spiel
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
so i think we have a path forward then
 
01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:06.229 align:start position:0%
so i think we have a path forward then
for

01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
prescript verify is an important
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
concept that many of us feel is is
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
justified here and a study committee i
 
01:51:19.599 --> 01:51:20.470 align:start position:0%
justified here and a study committee i
think

01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
could uh potentially give us the
 
01:51:22.719 --> 01:51:24.070 align:start position:0%
could uh potentially give us the
verification

01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
verification
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
that we need that this proposed
 
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.430 align:start position:0%
that we need that this proposed
legislation

01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
can move forward so i think
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is we'll
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
add a study committee to the text of
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
part four
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we'll change the date on the
 
01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:43.109 align:start position:0%
and we'll change the date on the
effective

01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
change the effective date of the
 
01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.390 align:start position:0%
change the effective date of the
legislation

01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh 18 months or two months two years out
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
to give the study committee time to
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
provide the verification
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
that um what's contained in the
 
01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:58.870 align:start position:0%
that um what's contained in the
legislation

01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
is actually implementable so we'll put
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
that all together and i'll have
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
a an amendment for everyone
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'll submit all this to ols tomorrow and
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
then as soon as
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
ols can act we'll have an amendment
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
for sb91 that contains
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
new language for part one
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
new language for part four it eliminates
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh part five altogether and as soon as
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
ols can
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
supply us with that um amendment i will
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
send it to everybody
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
and then we will plan on having an
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
executive session on the amendment
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
on either monday or tuesday of next week
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i'll also let you know about which
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
of those two days we'll be meeting
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
i think uh right now it looks like we
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
might be able to meet on monday so
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
from information i just received a
 
01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
little while ago so
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'll keep you posted and in the meantime
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'll ask
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts if she'd
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
so my comment is simply that i
 
01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.629 align:start position:0%
so my comment is simply that i
understand

01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
the the value in a study committee but
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
why not
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
just retain particu you know put an
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
another date on section 4 and do a
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so that we can bring it
 
01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.030 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so that we can bring it
back

01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
asap because if you form a stud
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh no that's i i do not
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
understand why we wouldn't
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
defer to a study committee so that that
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
the people who are working on this now
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
who may not be here when you envision a
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
would be able to work on it and get it
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's all okay thank you for that
 
01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.270 align:start position:0%
that's all okay thank you for that
comment

01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh anybody else have anything else they
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
need to add
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're almost at the lunch hour time to
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
adjourn the meeting uh representative
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
oxendine do you have a last comment
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
in just a second what was said that i
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
think a subcommittee
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
and let's let's get this thing in the
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
works and you know january 1
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
let's not be talking 18 months to two
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
years that's
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
completely unnecessary and it would
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
really be holding up
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
it would be a drag on the new hampshire
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing on our renewable energy
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
and and it's not helping us get to any
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
of our goals
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the 10-year energy transition none
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative man you get the last word
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i just have to say um
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
i envision in the future a pretty
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
complex system of many many many
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
components scattered all over the state
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
all over the region
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
and um i think we're going to need a
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
pretty good computer system to keep that
 
01:55:05.119 --> 01:55:07.109 align:start position:0%
pretty good computer system to keep that
reliable

01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
um we have to you know eventually we
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
will someday be
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
wondering about the um the
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
vulnerability of such a system
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
the uh that's a good topic a separate
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
topic but
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
yes it is a very separate topic less
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable than one
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
centralized system that goes down with a
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
flick of the switch
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a productive work
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
session i thank you all for
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh your attendance i apologize that we
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
had to
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
reschedule the presentation on hb2
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
the department of energy but that was
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
out of our hands the senate um
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
took away our presenters basically by
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
forcing them to
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
do a presentation before the senate
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
finance committee so
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%

mann's comment that the statewide energy
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
data platform which is now called the
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
energy data hub
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
went to the public utilities commission
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
for a settlement hearing between the
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
utilities and all the stakeholders that
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
have been working on it for the last 17
 
01:56:42.239 --> 01:56:42.870 align:start position:0%
have been working on it for the last 17
months

01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i was one of the interveners on that
 
01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
so i got to sign the settlement
 
01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:47.030 align:start position:0%
so i got to sign the settlement
agreement

01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
and uh they're in deliberations now but
 
01:56:49.599 --> 01:56:50.390 align:start position:0%
and uh they're in deliberations now but
um

01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
they what we asked them for was approval
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
to submit an rfp
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
based on all the requirements that had
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
been defined during that process with a
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
lot of technical folks
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
and so we will actually have a tool
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
that will allow us to see what we cannot
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
see now for this energy that's coming
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%

a dispersed and diverse energy system
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
some way to look at it and to do
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
planning and we don't have that today so
 
01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:21.669 align:start position:0%
planning and we don't have that today so

01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
gate with
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
a settlement with the utilities um which
 
01:57:31.199 --> 01:57:32.070 align:start position:0%
a settlement with the utilities um which
was

01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
