00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
all as you know we have four bills to go
 
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.550 align:start position:0%
all as you know we have four bills to go
through

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
today House Bill 190 232 182 and 82 and
 
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
there have been some amendments and um
 
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
some of these amendments you have not
 
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to review very well
 
00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
at all and I respect that so at any time
 
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and I um feel it
 
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate to to vote on
 
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
something and bring it up because
 
00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
there's not been an appropriate time to
 
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
review the Amendments we will recess uh
 
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
if we can for a short period of time if
 
00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
not we will recess to the following
 
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
Thursday to resolve
 
00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
anything right we did the best we could
 
00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:51.830 align:start position:0%
anything right we did the best we could
with

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.910 align:start position:0%
with
OS

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 232
 
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
FN uh as you know is retained had a
 
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
number of subcommittees and a lot of
 
00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
things were done um meetings were had
 
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the subcommittee as well as the
 
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor obviously many of
 
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
you were not here for that and we felt
 
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate um to hear from the
 
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor
 
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
um as to some of the discussions that
 
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
have been had representative
 
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
Sullivan say that about say that
 
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
accurately yes okay so at this point we
 
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
will introduce the Department of
 
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 align:start position:0%

you to ask any questions of the
 
00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
yours went
 
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
back my apologies technology is not my
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
strong suit um I'm Dan Daniel Albert I'm
 
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner of the
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um I'll allow my
 
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
counterpart to introduce himself I'm
 
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
Wesley Gardner director of the Workers
 
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
Compensation Division for the New
 
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
Labor so the department has uh reviewed
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
the proposed um language relative to uh
 
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
the um to the house bill um and I'm I I
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
believe attorney Gardner who was former
 
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the department has
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
had um the most dealings with um I'm
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
going to let him give a bit of an
 
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
overview about the uh amendments that
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
are on the table uh as well as um some
 
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
background as to the Department's
 
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
matter just a moment please represent
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
Solan just to save you some time you you
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
said amendments plural um the uh only
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that has been distributed is
 
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment that U um uh represents
 
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
option two forg forgive me I was
 
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
thinking in the context of the the the
 
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
various conversations that have occurred
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's I just didn't want to have
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
you go through something that no one's
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
ever going to see no wor I appreciate
 
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
the clarification thank
 
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
you so yes so relative to what was uh
 
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
previously termed option two um
 
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
essentially what this would do is allow
 
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
the department to use Ru making and
 
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
would direct the department over I
 
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
believe a three-year period to
 
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules that are at least as
 
00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 align:start position:0%
effective as OSHA section
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
1910 um which is for general duty uh
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
sorry General construction I believe um
 
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
again so this would be through rule
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
making that we would do this um and this
 
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
was as I understand it kind of a
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
compromise to the initial bill that
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
you're all aware of from
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
232 that would allow stakeholders to
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
have a say in this um and forego the
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
overall adoption of section 1910 because
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
there were some issues that were brought
 
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
to the table um I can say um at the last
 
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
committee meeting one of the major
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
issues that came up that I think a lot
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
of people are interested in is
 
00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if we were to wholesale
 
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
adopt section
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
1910 um there'd be certain pieces that
 
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
are required to meet OSHA standards the
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
major um example that was given by
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
director roas um last two weeks ago I
 
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
apologies not last week was the exiter
 
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
town hall um which has some fire doors
 
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
that Upon Our review when we went there
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
recently for a safety inspection would
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
not comply with section 1910 were we
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
just to adopt the OSHA language so again
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended for the Department
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
to review the 1910s and do it for lack
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
of a better term the New Hampshire way
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
um with input from the legislature input
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
from the stakeholders and input from
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
other agencies because Upon Our review
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
of this we did find out that certain
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
state agencies municipalities had some
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
very genuine concerns that they'd have
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
to replace some very expensive equipment
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and might kind of bleed into what
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
would be an unfunded mandate at the end
 
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
of the day um so that's kind of the
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
overarching um bill that we're left with
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
now um again I know we had initially
 
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
talked uh several years back about a
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
state plan so that's not this and I like
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
to just clarify so everyone's aware this
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
is not a state plan there will be no
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds involved in this um and
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
there will be need to be um some
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
additional safety inspectors as well
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
because what we would anticipate doing
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
is while this is rolling out while we're
 
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
prating rules uh we would anticipate a
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
lot of the stakeholders coming to us
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
asking can you do a review of our
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
facilities make sure that we're in
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
compliance tell us where we might have
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
holes so we can get ahead of this
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
because again we understand that a lot
 
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
of these stakeholders will have to
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
generate funds whether that's through
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
taxes or other mandates um so again we
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
would expect essentially a consultancy
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
program to be in place as well where one
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
we would be doing Outreach but also we'
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
be Fielding calls from the stakeholders
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
and doing more audits than we normally
 
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
do as it is we have two full-time safy
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
inspectors and a position for a third um
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
but again so we would have to expand
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
that program a little bit and obviously
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions on any of
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
said representative
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
Sullivan couple things that uh I think
 
00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
might might be added for clarification
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
um there were some concerns expressed
 
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
about uh employers needing to add on um
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
additional expert staff to uh to do do
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
some reviews and I think what you just
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
said about the consultancy program um
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
should allay some of that concern in
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
that the department is going to take on
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
the role of assisting Employers in in
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
making the transition to the um um the
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
the new standards um
 
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
the another thing that it's it's a bit
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the weeds um but something came up in
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
the last couple days in that there is a
 
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.749 align:start position:0%
the last couple days in that there is a
concern

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.869 align:start position:0%
concern
that

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh new new things like the coid um uh
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
standards um could crop up over the
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
years and be um and the employers would
 
00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
be confronted with those things um um as
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
OSHA adopts them I think it's important
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
to note that um letter U which is an
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
exception is the coid standard we are
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
not adopting that in addition the
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um insisted that we also not
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
adopt the placeholder alphabet pieces um
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
and um I'm glad he insisted that because
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
essentially it you know takes away the
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
concern that um something coid like
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
might happen two years 10 years you know
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
20 years from now and they'll grab
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
another one of those letters and um come
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
up with some some new standards to fit
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
the uh the issue at the time we we would
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
be in a position to say that's a
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
standard we need let's let's go for it
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
um but we wouldn't have to um we would
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
be in the same position as we are right
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
now with Co so
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
um there was some care taken to make
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we um protected employers as
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
best we could um I would also uh uh add
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
in that there is um an authority granted
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
in this uh Amendment uh for the
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
Department to determine that um uh
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
certain standards in the ocean 1910 um
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh list are not applicable to public
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
sector employees or Employers in and
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
employees in uh in New Hampshire and
 
00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
they would be able to not Draft rules to
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh reflect uh um standards that have
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with um our you know our
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
workers here um so um and I guess I'd
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
further like to point out that what we
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
did was very intentional when we said um
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
we asked the department um to create a
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
transition plan that would be workable
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
for the department and for employers um
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
and um and I think you did a fantastic
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
job and I appreciate work um I'm I'm a
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
believer that if you want something done
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
right let let the experts weigh in um
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's what we've done
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm uh I'm pleased with the evolution
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
of this process four years ago there was
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
a bill that would have just that would
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
have created the state
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
plan that then evolved into a um study
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee which made a recommendation of
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
adopting the 1910 standards and that's
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
where we were headed forward with this
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
we then had the retained bill because
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
employers wanted to weigh in they did
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
over the month of September and October
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
and we used that
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
input I'll say the department used the
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
input credit where it's do um Department
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
used that input to create this um at
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
least effective at least as effective
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
language that allows um the Department
 
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
of Labor to um use common sense in
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
figuring out how best to apply this
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
another example that was brought up
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
during those hearings was the department
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
of um um Environmental Services
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
indicated that they they have some
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
um uh air quality testing equipment um
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
that is very expensive as you said um
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
also very
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
effective however it's built in Europe
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
and because of that it does not um meet
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
all of the ocean um certification
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
standards there's nothing wrong with the
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
equipment it
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
simply doesn't you know cross the tees
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
and out the eyes um this allows the
 
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
department to say that equip equipment
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
is absolutely fine it's going to work
 
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
just fine there are no safety issues um
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
and we're going to prove it um so again
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
where this is evolved to I think is um a
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
win-win for um for those of us who want
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
to see um safety standards you know it's
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
important to point out that
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
what what adopting this amendment does
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
is it fills in the many many gaps that
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
currently exist in the safety standards
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
fills fills it in in a New Hampshire
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
friendly way but it fills them in um
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I I kind of want to stop you for a
 
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
second I let you go for a while here um
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
you have your you're GNA have your time
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
to to okay okay Joe just wrap it up and
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
we're going to have some more questions
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
for these folks but go ahead I have my
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
say um we're we're here right now we
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
having questions for the Department
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
um you raised the issue uh all at least
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
I heard you say uh the unfunded
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
mandate um and currently the law has
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
this law has already been created the
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
safety standard uh law has already been
 
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.829 align:start position:0%
safety standard uh law has already been
created

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically if and tell me if I'm uh
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
wrong there are a couple of ways we
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
could have
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
gone you have the authority to
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules under the
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
department but it was the process we
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
have now we thought was more
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it it gives you more
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
Direction it um so how when you talk
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
about unfunded mandates if that would to
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
come up again uh can you explain that uh
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
as to what what that would mean given
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
that you already have the authority to
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
do this it's already in the law well so
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
I think the key difference in what's
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
already in the law and what is being
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
proposed today is while we do have rul
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
making Authority it's obviously limited
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
to what is in 277 um we can't just start
 
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
expanding it you know there is uh I want
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
to say essentially like ladders
 
00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:22.519 align:start position:0%
scaffolding medical kits maybe a handful
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
of other pieces in there um but that's
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
kind of what our rul making Authority is
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
limited to to expanding that to explain
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
exp in what those standards should be um
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
what this would do though is we'd be
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
looking to the 1910s which obviously as
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're all aware by now is much more
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
expansive goes into a lot more detail
 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
there so I think that's the key
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
difference between what we currently
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
have in place um so again we wouldn't if
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
we were to keep what we had in place we
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just be able to say be directed
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
to promulgate rules and then just start
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
essentially doing um legislative rul
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
making um and adding in pieces that are
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
not part part of the
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
277 if that makes
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
sense thank
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
Department representative
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
Granger uh so would this proposal allow
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
them to make rules uh for public sector
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
employees that uh in any way are not
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
described in Ocean 1910 so for instance
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
if uh if uh the Department of Labor
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
wanted people to wear masks or they had
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
to maintain social distancing or any of
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
the other nonsense we've seen over the
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
past several years would this allow them
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
to do that no in the sense that it is
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
limited to the 1910s and the ru making
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
Authority is to make sure that our
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
standards are at least as effective as
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
the 1910s we could not go into anything
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
else obviously as chairman infantine had
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out and representative Sullivan
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
that we had carved out subpart U which
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
was the coid portion the only caveat
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
that I would set forth there is while
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any coid related items
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
in the other subp parts of course
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's you know pieces of masks or
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
something but those as my understanding
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
are are related to the actual work being
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
done so it's not a coid um piece um so
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
it' be much more like um you know if
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing some work that uh some dust
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
particles might be coming off of that
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
the oosha standard says wear a mask but
 
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
again that's not you know I think your
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
question's relative to co and other kind
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
of mandates like that again subpart U is
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
very specific to co so there there are
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
some mandates um or you know laws or
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
rules in 1910 relative to mask but not
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
coid other than subp
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
partu thank you you're welcome I'm going
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
to answer a question that I think is
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
going around here so o ocean 1910 has 26
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
Parts A through Z right you subpart U
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
had to do with coid type things that has
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
been removed X and
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
Y are blank a few of them are blank so
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that those were
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
removed so if OSHA chose to add
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
something to those we wouldn't be
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
automatically obligated to them those
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
are empty spaces within the 26 letters
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
of the alphabet where they could add
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
some things so if you wonder why we've
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
excluded some of these things that's why
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
some of them one was coid related issues
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
and one has just nothing they're just
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
placeholders so that's what you
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
understand when we start saying subpart
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
you and whatever what that all
 
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
means represent a
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
proud thank you um regarding ocean how
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
they deal with how they put things under
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
letters under 1910 and everything else
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
would there be anything stopping OSHA
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
from Sally using this as an example but
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
it could be broader moving section U to
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
be now section a sub paragraph one um or
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
doing other reorganizations like that
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
could that could have un effects that
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
are at least from where we're sitting
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
here today we would view them as
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
unexpected so I can't say 100% because
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you I don't know
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
OSHA's Ru making um on the federal level
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
what I can say though is I think it
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
would be quite a leap for them to take
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
one a full subpart um I think your
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
question's well founded in the sense
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
that they very well could add some
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
pieces to other sub parts that were
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
adopted here um I think the key piece of
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
this legislation really comes down to
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
again we're not just wholesale adopting
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
this and taking exactly what they're
 
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
saying because they do do yearly updates
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we as the
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
department if this passes we'll have to
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
look into to make sure it's at least as
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
effective but we're not doing the
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
wholesale adoption it is going through
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
rul making with public notice public
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
hearing so everyone can have input um to
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
include the legislature to include the
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so again to your question I
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
I cannot not imagine that they would be
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
able to take an entire subpart and put
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
it into another another subpart that
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
would be encompassed here that being
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
said though yes I believe that they
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
could make more robust standards to um
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know add pieces to that given that
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
the coid um standards are in subp partu
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a little odd if they
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
started putting those into other places
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
CU these subp parts are very specific to
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
types of equipment of work um so it just
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't seem relevant to me that they
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
would do that but again caveat being I
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly how they do it on the
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
federal level as I reles to rule
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
making follow
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
up um I
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
guess how would it work if a subpart
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
that we did incorporate referenced a
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
subpart we didn't say for example you
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
know they went through every letter that
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
they have there and say this is how
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
section U apply applies to when this
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
work is being done and you know it may
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
look like that's in conflict with
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
Section U and this is how you resolve
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
that conflict and just all those mess of
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
inter relationships how would that get
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
resolved yeah that's a fair question I
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
do think that this was kind of addressed
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
through um section four of the proposed
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
language which does state that the
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall have authority to
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
determine if standards are inapplicable
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
to employers and unnecessary to
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
implement um so again the department has
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
a level of discretion here to determine
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
if there are pieces of the subp parts
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
that are just that don't work for New
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're not applicable and
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
they're unnecessary so I think in that
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
case it's a piece that we would be able
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
to look at and say that this is really
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
not necessary because we specifically in
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
this example of Co we specifically
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
Exempted subp part U um so we would see
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
if there are pieces of it that through
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
the Incorporated reference might have
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
relevance to what we're actually looking
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
for but again we would we would look
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
look at the end of the day to the fact
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
that subpart U was specifically Exempted
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
so um for that reason I think that's how
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
this bill actually um ensures that
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be an issue in the
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
future thank you of course
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth and
 
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.149 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth and
representative

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chairman um I'd
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
like you to clarify something I think I
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
heard you said earlier and kind of to
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
paraphrase um you said that your
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
existing rul making Authority
 
00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:29.390 align:start position:0%
existing rul making Authority
is

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
limited to the rules that have already
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
been promulgated and I'd like you to
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
explain that further the authorization
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
for those rules to me seemed somewhat
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
Broad in that uh
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
2771 which is what you make the rules
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
according to um says anything that's
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous to safety or health of
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
employees so it would seem to me that if
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
you discover a new danger that isn't in
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
the existing rules you do have existing
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
Authority could you close that so yeah
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's a fair question um and I
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
think that's something that's been a
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a point of contention throughout
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
this as well too is do we have the
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
authority to do that um and I think what
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
we have found is yes to your point we
 
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799 align:start position:0%
could do a little bit but you know we
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
really need a basis for this and I think
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's really difficult for us to say
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
through rule making that as you said you
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
know we notice something that's
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous but yet the legislature did
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
not see fit to put any of that even an
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
inkling of that you know say it's fire
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
doors or something like that we have
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
nothing uh concerning fire doors
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in the 277 so again I think
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
we kind of run into the potential issue
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
of legislating through rule um and the
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
push back with that so um yes so thank
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
you for the question to clarify um that
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's kind of more where I was going
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
with it I do think that there is there
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
is a potential that we could do some rul
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
making and I think that was an option
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
that was kind of discussed at the last
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
committee meeting but we'd be I I would
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
say we'd be incredibly limited and we
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
would also expect to receive a fair bit
 
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
of push back that you know we're we're
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
legislating at the end of the day um so
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
I think that was kind of the concern and
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's why you know we have the intro
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
paragraph that looks to the 1910s for
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
guidance because that was another piece
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
that came up routinely is what are we
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
looking at for guidance here if it's not
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
our own rules or our own laws and again
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at something else using
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
a basis of say it's OSHA another state
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
that they're doing this I think that
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
kind of tends to bleed into legislating
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
through Ru making so that was the
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
concern there thank you representative
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
Granger followed by representative
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
kale uh so we uh were discussing uh the
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
issues of uh sort of aiming at the rules
 
00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:54.390 align:start position:0%
issues of uh sort of aiming at the rules
of

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
1910 um and that leads to certain
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
problems that I and him might brought up
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
would it not make sense just to Peg it
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
to a specific year and just say the the
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
ocean 1910 rules of the Year
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
2023 in the actual legislation and then
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
in the future as they get updated if
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
they get updated in a way that's
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
significant or important then the
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislator can adopt legislature can
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
adopt that uh in the future I could see
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
that being as a fair compromise I I I
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't see a reason we couldn't do that
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
um and and I I think it's a point well
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
taken that if we have a piece that's
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
static and time then we all kind of
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
generally know exactly what is coming in
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
the next three years as we promate
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
rules thank you representative
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
kale thank you Mr chair um as I
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly the private
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
sector is regulated by OSHA and we're
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
just changing it to extend it to the
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
public sector workers
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
correct yes in the sense that um we're
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
not really extending all of Osha 1910 is
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
only one of the Parts
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
followup good all right so then uh and
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
and we're doing the New Hampshire 603
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
version so that you will be aiming at
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
making them as effective but not but not
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
a copy of the 1910 regulations yes
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct because one of the
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
overarching concerns I think we heard
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
and is well founded is that um you know
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
the 1910s I believe is you know 1100
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
pages when you print it out um and
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of minutia in there um and
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
it can be overbearing for for not just
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
for the stakeholders but I think you
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
know for it would be overbearing for us
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
to implement to a point because you know
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
we have to have our safety inspectors
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
trained on this it takes time so again
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
the intent being that it's at least as
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
effective and we're looking at those
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
standards without having to go into you
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
know it can be a couple of paragraphs
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
rather than 20 pages on scaffolding and
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
we say this is at least as effective as
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
the OSHA regulations and gets us as safe
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
as the OSHA regulations and again as
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
much more digestible for the
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the public one one more
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
no follow up thank you very much all
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
right so um one of the things that one
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
that brought us here was the fact of of
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
a public sector worker being injured and
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
not having it investigated uh after the
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
fact is that something that would be
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
addressed if if we do this so this would
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
just be the standards at the end of the
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
day I will say the other piece of that
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
as I testified to earlier is the intent
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
would also be for us to have a more
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
robust safety program in the sense that
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
we would have consultancies we would
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
have a safety manager we would have
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
other safety officers so in that sense
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
you know we would have more uh bandwidth
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
to go out and do these checks to do
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
audits um to make sure that places are
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
safe um and you know more investigations
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day thanks very much
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie then
 
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie then
representative

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.350 align:start position:0%
representative
Sullivan

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I have kind of a twoie question
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
microphone a little
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
closer I have uh I have kind of a two-
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
pie question the first one relates to
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
the progression of the law which moved
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
the number from five to
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
15 so when you move that number up in
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
terms of who is required to file who is
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
required to have safety and health
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
programs in their in their facilities do
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
you have any sense of how many people C
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
out you're saying for the um joint Loss
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
Management committee and the safety
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
programs I do not I I I wouldn't want to
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
try and fashion a guess honestly um so
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100% sure I mean I'm sure as
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
we're all aware though a lot of
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire are small
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
businesses and more than likely below 15
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
and probably a good chunk that are in
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
that five to 15 range um but again I I
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
do not have that data
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and then the second part
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
if I could y uh
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
um so I would like you to speak to the
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
question of
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
discretion and there is
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
currently uh as what I can see um just a
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh gives a commissioner a lot of
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
authority gives you a lot of authority
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
to determine you know what goes in and
 
00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
what doesn't go in I mean we can
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
certainly petition uh to change the
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
rules that's we have that we have that
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh we can do that but speak to the
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
discretion and how those decisions you
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
think will be made as to what gets in
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
and what doesn't let you say discretion
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the rul making piece of
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah I mean yeah so so again
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know the at least is effective is
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
something we actually did pull from OSHA
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
language um because State Plans by and
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
large they do have a carbon copy of the
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
ocean regulations because it's frankly
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
simpler the other option that you can go
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
with is at least as effective meaning
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
what it says it's at least as effective
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
the problem that a lot of the uh States
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
hav gone with that as I understand it is
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
it requires a back and forth with OSHA
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
to determine on OSHA's basis if it's
 
00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:05.519 align:start position:0%
leas is effective so again that's
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
something we pulled from there um and to
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
your question it is there is a decent
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
amount of discretion there I would say
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
um of what piece we would keep out what
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
we would keep in um you know if it
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
relates to measurements what is that I
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
think what we would be doing is through
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
the public hearing process making sure
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders are involved so we know
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
like you know boots on the ground beyond
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
that we would have our safety inspectors
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
before we're doing this Ru making and
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
while we are while we're doing the ru
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
making we would have them actually in
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
the field seeing how does this affect
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
people what you know what's safe they
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
would we would be all doing some
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
research so we would just the by and
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
large we would be informed by one what
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards are themselves two
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
reports through OSHA three our own
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
safety inspections four the stakeholders
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
ERS and five honestly I think the
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
legislature as well too because I think
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's a vested interest in a lot of
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
members of this committee and I think a
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
piece of this bill was so um everyone
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
including members of this committee
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
could have a say when we do come up with
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
Ru making to say you know I I've done my
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
own research and I think that we need
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
this piece of it um so to that point you
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
know again it's it is Broad you're
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
correct in that sense um but we've be
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
using all of those tools all of those
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
resources to inform our decision I
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
believe you know and and uh much like
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
anything else the the longer we go
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
through that process I would say the
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
better it gets for everybody because we
 
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:34.039 align:start position:0%
all have an understanding of it great I
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
terrific answer thank you very much
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
kahill's uh question about
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
investigations is isn't it true that a
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
few years ago we did pass a bill that
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
tightened up the um uh need for
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
reporting and investigations in the
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
cases of serious injuries and deaths on
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no other
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%

mind hanging around a little bit just in
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%

thank you as all us
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
recall we had a bill in front of us to
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
allow volunteer firefighters to not be
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
reprimanded or fired for um being late
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
to their job because they were attending
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
to an emergency and we got mired in all
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
kinds of different things about when
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
they could leave work when they could
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
not leave work when they were allowed
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
when they were not then we had the um
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
when we had some of the um retained uh
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
sessions these uh representative wolf
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
want the same rights that the ambulance
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
drivers currently have which really
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
States if you are on the way to your uh
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
place of of work and you you either
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
witness or come across an emergency you
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
must W render assistance and and do what
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
you need to do and you cannot be
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
reprimanded or or uh fired for doing so
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
and I've done the same thing here for
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.309 align:start position:0%
 
line

00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
it is line 10 and
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
11 they witness or come upon while in
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
employment that is what has been
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
added and I removed the uh part that uh
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
on the original bill which kind of gave
 
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.309 align:start position:0%
on the original bill which kind of gave
a

00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
definition um which really removed the
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
ability um the the whole thing about
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
um leaving your office leaving your
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
place of business
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be the desire of the
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor um and that is what I have
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
done and again uh representative
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
Sullivan since this was presented uh to
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
everyone just now if it is your
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
desire to
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
um postpone this to another date that
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable I will leave it up
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
to you in
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.309 align:start position:0%
to you in
your

00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
group I would say for the time being
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
Let's uh keep going and see where we we
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
land the possibility we may want to take
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
a short caucus but let's uh I guess can
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
I launch into a question Mr
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
chair go ahead thank you um as I
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
recollect during our um discussion of
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
the retain Bill we we were looking at
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
some existing um an existing statute
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
that dealt with the emergency um um
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
medical Tech techicians and um is is
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at right now that uh
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
that language with the firefighters
 
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:41.390 align:start position:0%
that language with the firefighters
added

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
in would you ask the question one more
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
time sure um I remember finding a
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
statute during our um discussion earlier
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the retain
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
bill in that statute um provided pretty
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
much exactly what what representative
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
wolf was looking for for as I recollect
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
emergency medical
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
technicians um and the thought was just
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
add the firefighters in and we're there
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:22.839 align:start position:0%
done yes and no you're talking about
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
section RSA
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.670 align:start position:0%
section RSA
153a

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
subsection where we took this from to
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
try to copy it
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
add this to 153 because this 153
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
is emergency medical and Trauma Services
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay really didn't fit but I will
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
would like to at least show
 
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.109 align:start position:0%
would like to at least show
you

00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
exactly what the wording is so you can
 
00:40:08.599 --> 00:40:22.470 align:start position:0%
exactly what the wording is so you can
review

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
it and everyone has 153a out in front of
 
00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:28.829 align:start position:0%
it and everyone has 153a out in front of
them

00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
here I had a dog tag dog AED here to
 
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.190 align:start position:0%
here I had a dog tag dog AED here to
find

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
it Well you guys are going to have to
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
153 while you're looking frankly my
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
concern was that we would put it in the
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
wrong part of the law the fact that it's
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
been moved is a good thing now but I
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
want to find the exact sentence so we
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
can have let me start from the beginning
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
I I'd rather it be the exact thing M um
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
a17

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
two that's liability it's different
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
Sullivan yes if I might read please do
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
I'm reading 153
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
a17 Roman numeral 2
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay and I know you're looking at it
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
there so for everyone
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
else's no license emergency medical care
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
provider who in good faith attempts to
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
render Emergency Medical Services
 
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
authorized by the this chapter at any
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
emergency scene while in route to a
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
place of employment shall receive any
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
form of reprimand or penalty by an
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
employer as a result of late arrival in
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.510 align:start position:0%
 
employment

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions I
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
didn't see that
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
R um yeah if I could just follow up
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.910 align:start position:0%
R um yeah if I could just follow up
um

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
again I I think it's appropriate that
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
that language be moved into the right um
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
part of the statute um I guess my
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
question is um do the emergency medical
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
technicians are they now um uh cited in
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
two different U places in our statutes
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
275 and
 
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:54.910 align:start position:0%
275 and
155

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:57.079 align:start position:0%
153 I I believe they're two different
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
things 153a has to do
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
with I believe it's mostly uh ambulance
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh and EMTs whereas
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
275a volunteers believe has volunteer
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
fire department and emergency medical
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
technicians so deal volunteers could
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
there be a lapse excuse me could there
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
be a um overlapping yes which is why I
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
let tried to make the language exactly
 
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:22.990 align:start position:0%
let tried to make the language exactly
the

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
same you can't put the volunteer
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
firefighters into the EMTs and you can't
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
put the EMTs on the volunteer
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
comments all
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
people uh representative Sullivan are
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
time I think I think we'd like to take a
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
quick caucus just make sure we're on the
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
same page okay
 
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:56.920 align:start position:0%

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
long not more than all right we'll

suspend for five minutes to a recess for
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
caucus all right so yours isn't going to
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%

don't

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%

thank you recognizing me yes I have okay
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
um it was pointed out to us that um we
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
still have a 60-day um uh um
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
implementation period for um for this
 
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.349 align:start position:0%
implementation period for um for this
bill

00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
and the concern was that on line six of
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment of the amendment um it
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
indicates employers shall provide
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
employees at least the level of
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
protection um provided under the federal
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
occupation safety and health
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
administration standards found in 29 CFR
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
part 1910
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
um if that language is in
 
00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.390 align:start position:0%
um if that language is in
there

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
would um the department have to start
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
enforcing um standards that are at least
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
effective within 60 days my sense was
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
that the department would start writing
 
00:57:16.359 --> 00:57:18.230 align:start position:0%
that the department would start writing
rules

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:57:22.029 --> 00:57:22.039 align:start position:0%
anytime after 60 days and within three
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
years um but it
 
00:57:25.559 --> 00:57:26.390 align:start position:0%
years um but it
do

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
you it seems to me there might be a
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
problem with that language does it seem
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
to be a problem to you as well uh so yes
 
00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:35.799 align:start position:0%
representative I think I would agree
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
that there could be an interpretive
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
problem in How It Was Written and that's
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
a a good call on that um I think the
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
intent as you stated really was for us
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
to begin drafting rules and to put
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on notice that you know
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
they will be required to provide what's
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
at least as is effective um but um but
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes as the as it's technically written I
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
I think it would be correct to state
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
that the employers 60 days upon Passage
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
would be required to provide that level
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
of safety um I would State though that
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know as we kind of discussed
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
throughout uh the multiple years of
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
committees that we've dealt with this
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know the department would be working
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
with those employers um it wouldn't be
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
punitive um of course that's uh that's
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
not within the the actual statute at
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
that point so I would say I it's a
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
well-founded concern um but you know the
 
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
intent we would always have and have had
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
since we've been discussing this is to
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
go in do the best we can in the interim
 
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:44.839 align:start position:0%
before the rules are drafted to do these
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
pencil Audits and determine where these
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh public employers are at relative to
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
the 1910s and where we think they might
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:58:56.029 --> 00:58:56.039 align:start position:0%
be Mr Speaker
 
00:58:56.039 --> 00:58:58.029 align:start position:0%
be Mr Speaker
speaker

00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
really we did need one for Mr chairman
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
works thank you
 
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
um having come this far with this it
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea to get it right
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
rather than close to right um so um I
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
would propose Mr chairman that um we um
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
do get a further adjustment of this
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
amendment um that would
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
um that would indicate the rule making
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
could begin 60 days after passage
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
um but there would be a three-year
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
period to complete that process um and
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
that uh we just make it clear that until
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
the rules are written you're not
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
enforcing the
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
rule so what do you say Mr chairman I
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
say you have uh until uh um Tuesday uh
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
next Thursday at 2
 
00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
p.m where we will reconvene this
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
committee to deal with any business that
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
we did not finish
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
today including
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
k um thank you Mr chair I just I
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
wondered if because this is now now just
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
recently identified and something that
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
could be fairly straightforward in
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
remedying could this be done with a
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment rather than having us
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:28.349 align:start position:0%
 
Thursday

01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
you know I it technically it could I
 
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
just I don't want it to bring
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
fodder um for a lot of things
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I will tell you I'll be honest with
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
you I think because we're meeting here
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
today people are starting to look at
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
these things and there might be another
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
sentence or two that who knows uh might
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
come to our
 
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
attention um so um we we have the time
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're doing this early enough before
 
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.390 align:start position:0%
uh we're doing this early enough before
our

01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
deadline um whether we all agree on the
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
final thing or not it's not because a
 
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:04.839 align:start position:0%
lot of people didn't spend a lot of time
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
to try to get it
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
right see you next Thursday all right
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%

a

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
second second by represent drgo is uh
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
you may speak to your
 
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
motion it seems to me that uh employees
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
and employer should have the same set of
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
Rights um I had I enjoy the ability to
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
so I have European co-workers that don't
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
have this uh but I can quit my job
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
whenever I want I can just stop showing
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
up it doesn't matter what my reason is
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter why it could be
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
because I found a better opportunity it
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
could be a horrible reason it could be
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
simply I don't like my boss's sweater it
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what the reason is it
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be just it doesn't need
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
to be fair because I can make my own
 
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
decisions and if I make a bad decision
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
if I uh leave a job that was a good job
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
for a dumb reason I I suffer the
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
consequences I no longer have that job I
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
no longer have that income Source rights
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
aren't this sort of thing that apply to
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
some people but not others and that you
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
can exercise them when it's convenient
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
and not when it's not convenient if if
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
an employee or a company wants to fire
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
someone for any reason no matter what
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
they should have the same rights as the
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
employee does and if they lose a
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
valuable employee just because they had
 
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
a medic medical cannabis card then
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
that's their loss and yeah it's the
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
employees loss too but if I quit my job
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's the employer's loss
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
you can't be forcing people to comply to
 
01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
our idea of what is right and what is
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
wrong we have to let people have rights
 
01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
and get let them keep their rights and
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
that implies whether you like the
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
employer whether you dislike the
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
employer you got to let people do what
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
they do and they're never going to do
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
everything you want them to do they're
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
always going to do what they want to do
 
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
you got to have to live with
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
that representative uh representative
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
whatever parts of that AR argument I
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
agree with um I'd like to ask the
 
01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
committee to please vote against this
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
motion um I think what we heard when
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
this bill was presented at least what
 
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
made the biggest impact on me is that
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
um made a ruling on this issue and I
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
believe that if we can get to my
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment it will address exactly what
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%

that if we have competing
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
amendments uh we will make our case for
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
each one if each one does not pass
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a 1010 so be it and then
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with it as we do on the house

even call for motions representative
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
question so I just want to understand
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
what the competing amendments are uh it
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
is uh the amendment by rep kcom and the
 
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
amendment by rep seaworth is what we're
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the amendment from
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth has am number
 
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:39.550 align:start position:0%

amendment you're going to present
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
whether it is the um uh Adent Amendment
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
or the uh sponsor amendment I I would
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
point out the Adent U Amendment has
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
already passed so that's that is what we
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%

out yeah we did just folks it's been a
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
long time since we did this if you
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
recall what what occurred uh
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead representative
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
seaworth you can you just outlined it
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
better than I'm going to right now and
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
then representative Sullivan you can
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
opine all right so when this bill was
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
brought to us in the public hearing the
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor had already a draft drafted an
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to the original language said
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
that I have problems with my language is
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
drafted here's a substitute when we
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
first met an executive session we agreed
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
by a a margin to adopt that proposed
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we began I don't
 
01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
remember I think we didn't have anything
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
else we then started talking about OTP
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't agree that that language
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
was the final product so we ended up um
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
not voting on
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
OTP some other amendments were brought
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
forth and when then we voted to retain
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
the bill to work on the language of the
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
those Amendment amendments so we were
 
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
left with the what's labeled as the veil
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment as having been ad replacing
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
the original language
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
um and that's how it has stayed and and
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
I would only add that the correct number
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
on the veil amendment is 0549 H cop of
 
01:16:15.199 --> 01:16:18.189 align:start position:0%
on the veil amendment is 0549 H cop of
this

01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
am I think we should since most people
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.990 align:start position:0%

01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
cop this is the veil yes wrong one this
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
is the one we passed no it's
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
not says I'm sorry I'm sorry you're
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.639 --> 01:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
so hopefully if you have your original
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you and then the uh
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
H that is where the bill this is where
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
the the legislation stands now because
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment was passed by this
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
committee prior to it being
 
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.229 align:start position:0%
committee prior to it being
retained

01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
no I'm being told
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:30.990 align:start position:0%
no I'm being told
no

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
not changes okay the first time this has
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
happened to me in 20 years 18 years so
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan did you hear
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
what sh all right we uh explained that a
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
motion the bill was on excuse me the
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill was passed with Amendment
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
07858 however as soon as the bill was
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
retained that wiped out any amend
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
amendments they can still be
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
presented so we are now looking at um
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
the original bill doesn't mean that it
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
can't be presented
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
again all right so we're back to the
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
is I did I didn't know that new new one
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
on me is everyone all set with what
 
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.350 align:start position:0%
on me is everyone all set with what
we're

01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
doing don't have to
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
consider well um you know
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's put this way um representative
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
Sullivan uh we will be submitting one
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment would you like to uh look
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
through your amendments and determine if
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
how many if all if um or which one so we
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right I think you
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
might um all right so what we have
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
potential is there are three amendments
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
that were were presented to the
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh prior to uh the bill being
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
retained we have one being presented
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
today representative Sullivan has uh
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
allowed me to allow to make a motion to
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
um or to hear a motion for the amendment
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
which representative seaworth will be
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
provided and at that point after hearing
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
it they'll make the decision whether or
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
not there will be any um additional
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
amendments on their side so being there
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
he is I am being the way it is I will
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
accept a motion representative seaworth
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
you are recognized for a motion thank
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chairman I would move
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2023

01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
much and once again I want to apologize
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
for the late arrival I just got the
 
01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:51.639 align:start position:0%
language last night um but I I put this
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
amendment together uh it goes back to a
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
concern that I had when the bill was
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
first presented in this committee and it
 
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
was discussed that the language came
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
from a New Jersey Law And it sort of
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
bothered me that um these things tie
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
into other laws within labor maybe other
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
laws outside of Labor and I don't know
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
New Jersey Law and I wondered if there
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
was some kind of connection that I
 
01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
didn't understand so in putting together
 
01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
didn't understand so in putting together
this

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I wanted to tie it very
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
specifically to New Hampshire law and
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
very specifically to the New Hampshire
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case that actually has
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
created what we understood from um the
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
the public testimony the status quo of
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
the law on this
 
01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
the law on this
issue

01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.830 align:start position:0%
issue
um

01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
so much of this is is Tak taken directly
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
from the Supreme Court's opinion um the
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said that uh at issue in
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
the case before them was the disability
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
of the employee who had been
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
dismissed and that
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
the marijuana card and and the status as
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
a marijuana user was
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
not the key point in why he should
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been dismissed it was the
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
fact that he had a disability which is
 
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
protected under um RSA 354 D2 as
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
referenced in this
 
01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.950 align:start position:0%
referenced in this
law

01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
and so therefore if you uh review the
 
01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
language that I have it ties it to that
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
connection um and then also makes clear
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
that the the person who has a
 
01:26:55.119 --> 01:26:56.390 align:start position:0%
that the the person who has a
therapeutic

01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
card is presumed to have the disability
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
as protected under our existing statute
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
it also um covers the issue that we had
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
talked about before where
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
um this is not meant to authorize a
 
01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.109 align:start position:0%
um this is not meant to authorize a
person

01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:22.870 align:start position:0%
person
using

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis and being impaired by cannabis
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
on the job uh there is a presumption
 
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
that that is an undue hardship again
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
35482 thank you I'm going to take the
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
liberty of of making a comment here and
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
then I'd like uh to recognize
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative proud one of the issues
 
01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
that I had with the initial bill
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
was that I felt it went beyond in
 
01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.270 align:start position:0%
was that I felt it went beyond in
current

01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
employees to Future potential applicants
 
01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.790 align:start position:0%
employees to Future potential applicants
and

01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
employees and representative s and I
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
agreed to disagree on that matter he
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
wanted it in there and I did not want it
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
in there but thanks to representative
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
Prout and I and representative kcom
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
going through all of the equal
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity section 354 A7 and
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
everything else that is already in
 
01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
current law that you cannot discriminate
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
against future
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
employees so that's no longer a concern
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
of mine representative Prout you want to
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
expand on
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
this thank you um I think the SE withth
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment really um dovetails nicely
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
into our existing statutes um and it
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
creates the presumption is if you have a
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
card you have a qualifying disability
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
and then the entire body of law around
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities and how to handle them and
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
how to balance the rights of the
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
employee versus the needs of the
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
employer is just Incorporated and that's
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
been well litigated and I think the big
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
benefit we get from incorporating all of
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
that history is that there's a lot of
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
certainty about how things are supposed
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
to work and with that certainty brings
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
less cases going to court brings
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
everybody being certain of what they can
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
where they stand what they're supposed
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
to do what they can ask of employer what
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
they can't ask the employer and
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
basically in a and to cut it all short
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
reduces lawyer fees is less of these
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
cases will have to go to the lawyers to
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor to the courts
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that it will essentially be both
 
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
faster and cheaper to get a resolution
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
for all involved when these cases come
 
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
forward and that's really one of the
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
benefits I see of dub tailing it into
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
the existing New Hampshire law and
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
everything that goes with
 
01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.669 align:start position:0%
everything that goes with
that

01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%

patient not qualified
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
patient we will look into that and if we
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
do have to make an amendment on the
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
floor or something simple is that's is
 
01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
floor or something simple is that's is
that

01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%

always check uh representative Sullivan
 
01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%

pass as amended um and I guess I just
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh um the hard work and
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
study that uh uh some of my colleagues
 
01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
here have put into this and I think it
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh it accomplishes and I I he I heard
 
01:36:42.189 --> 01:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
one of the comments that this is going
 
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
to save a lot of legal fees that is true
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
and there's no sense in uh um dragging
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
more people um through the court system
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%

needed thank you I also appreciate all
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%

um uh bills in front of us I will let
 
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
you know that I'm expecting about 12 to
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
14 pieces of legislation coming to us uh
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
have not been able to read all the
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
things they're just titles so I just
 
01:40:22.109 --> 01:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
made a guess um and that um
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
our goal is to meet I believe it's the
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
18th and 25th of January to discuss uh
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
you know as many bills as possible I'd
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
like to have all of our bills heard
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
within three three days three Thursdays
 
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
so then we can dig into what we have and
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
again I don't know all of it
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie has a few that
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
he shared with me I haven't really seen
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
the wording yet but we'll wait and see
 
01:40:47.229 --> 01:40:47.239 align:start position:0%
some of them will be quick some of them
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
will require Sub sub
 
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.830 align:start position:0%
will require Sub sub
committees

01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
represent San do you have any comments
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh or any announcements no announcements
 
01:40:58.990 --> 01:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
but a comment um it seems that when we
 
01:41:01.709 --> 01:41:01.719 align:start position:0%
sit in partisan grouping we do our most
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan work so I I don't I don't get
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
it but it
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
is May than well I will take it as um
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
digging into it deep and trying to find
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
where we can make a compromise so thank
