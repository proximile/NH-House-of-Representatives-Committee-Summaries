Speaker chairman I mean I'm sorry Mr
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
chairman wrong
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
room this bill came to us uh we had a
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
work session on a Monday basically what
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
the bill does is it it takes the Surplus
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
which which is unspent and unallocated
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
allocated funds from the education trust
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
fund at the end of the year and moves it
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
into the general fund it does not it
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
does not eliminate the educational trust
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
fund it just says rather than keeping
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
cash unavailable to the state at the end
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the year any funds that are not spent
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
or allocated will move into the general
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
fund uh and Mr landrian has prepared an
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
ex the under current law what the
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund would look like
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the bayum so as you can see by the
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
end of the bayum without this there's
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
approximately $222 million that are
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
going to be sitting
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
unavailable to any other activity except
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
education in the state so what this
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
would do is we would never make it there
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
if the in fact it it it started in FY
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
2024 because at the end of FY 2024 182
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
million or whatever was unallocated or
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
spent would go into the general
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
fund so I I would look to uh
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative poii Mueller to make a
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
motion thank you I would like to make
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
1560 is there and there is a second
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
second representative Earth
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair we've heard a lot about
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
education um and we are very fortunate
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years that we have
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
had money remaining in the educational
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
trust and we have been able to add any
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
number of areas that belong to
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
education um we have um episodic
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
treatment that this is the first bium
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see it already the
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
costs are anticipated at around 7
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
million we also are in the midst of um a
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
funding lawsuit um we know that we're
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
going to be running into some issues we
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
have a committee right now a special
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
committee appointed by the speaker
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with this I believe this bill
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
belongs there it does not belong at the
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
in right here um we are at a point where
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
we may need those dollars to to increase
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of funding that we're giving
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
to um our adequacy funding so I would
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
ask that we at this point in time defer
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
this bill to the special committee on
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
education funding that is actually going
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
to meet tomorrow this is not the time to
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
mess around with the education trust
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
what message are we sending to the
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
public by emptying out the education
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
trust what message does that send to
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
those individuals who are working hard
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
to bring more funding to education our
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayers are bearing 80%
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
of the burden of our schools we can talk
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
more about the cost behind special
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
education so I think at this time I
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
won't Bel labor this issue I've been
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
clear on where I am on this point but I
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
think at this point in time we would
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
be publicly we would look very foolish
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
by taking the step at this point in time
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr I would remind
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
all that were restoring this part of the
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
budget to where it was when it left this
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee and went to the other body
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that messed this up we
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
had it all balanced we gave education
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
everything they needed and much of it
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
was general fund as it has always been
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the of the education
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund was to fund adequacy that was
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
its beginning that was its most
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
prevalent use occasionally some other
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
monies were used but all the other
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
purposes for education
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
special ed catastrophic Aid tuition and
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
transportation building Aid have always
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
come from general fund there's never
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
been a problem whether there's money
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
specifically in the education trust fund
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
because we could always take it out of
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
the general fund but when we have a fund
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
like Highway fund Fish and Game monies
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
can't go out of them they can go in from
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
the general fund but they can't come out
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
and we would be stuck with the same
 
00:24:53.389 --> 00:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
situation if we have education trust
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
fund with 200 million in it and we
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
suddenly find that we're 100 million
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
short on the litigation fund for the
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
senuna Youth Center what are we going to
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
do so we need to have this flexibility
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
we as the finance committee need to have
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to have more money in
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
the general fund for whatever is coming
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
ahead so that's why I put in this bill
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
because I think it's foolish to have
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
money in the education trust fund that's
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
tied up and can't be used even though
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
everything has been covered that was
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
requested for Education any further any
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
further representative hacken Phillips
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um yes I'm going to
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
join my colleague U representative Heath
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
in calling for the built instead of
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
being exec here today um for the aop
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
pass but to be sent to the subcommittee
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
of education and that's for three
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
reasons the first is that this past
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
election cycle I canvased over a
 
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
thousand doors in my district and the
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
number one priority issue of my
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
constituents was to f fund public
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
education it was not in fact to drain
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund I think that
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's probably very few Granite
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
Staters who understand the intricacies
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
of what the trust fund does and this is
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
not something they're asking for so I
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
think we have to recognize we're not
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
reflecting the will of the Granite
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
Staters right now by entertaining this
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
motion second the process of our
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
committee receiving the
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
bill Monday
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
being designated to our subcommittee on
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon and then the work
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
session that happened Monday afternoon
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh led us to today four days later I
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
think we can all acknowledge that four
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
days is a bit of a rush and that there
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
has been a lack of robust discussion
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
about the intricacies of what this would
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
actually mean for our state also there
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
was a concern that the AG did not weigh
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
in on the r decision and that there were
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
many members of subdivision division 2
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
who had questions about the
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that order and Our
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
obligation as division 2 members to
 
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
obligation as division 2 members to
fulfill

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
fulfill
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
that uh as well as also having several
 
00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:11.559 align:start position:0%
members not being present that day and
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
while it is true that the committee
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation vote would probably have
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
led to this moment anyway I think it's
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
worth acknowledging that the people who
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
are most invested and knowledgeable
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
about the situation were not included in
 
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.110 align:start position:0%
about the situation were not included in
the

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
discussion third I think that this is
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
probably not a prudent move given the
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
several unknowns that representative
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
Heath just spoke about but I'd also like
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
to talk about um a history that was
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
discussed in subcommittee of the general
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
fund not being adequate to fill the
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund fully when there
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
have been instances that the education
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund needed additional funding so
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
we know that the statement that the
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
general fund can backfill whatever we
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
need is not entirely true we also know
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
that the continuing warrant articles
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
within the um um Appropriations list
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
lines 19 through 44 mean that we don't
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
know what the ending balances will be
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
for actual or estimated 24 and
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
25 um that these are just our estimates
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
our projections but we all know that
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
those warrants can be much larger than
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
estimated um given several unknowns
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
about you know for instance special
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
education requirements in our
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
communities finally i' just like to
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that this Rand
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
decision is really important and the
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
public is watching um they are aware of
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
what the court has ordered and they will
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
be watching The Way We react and I would
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
charge that the most prudent thing to do
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
would be to put this issue before the
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
subcomittee because they are tasked with
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
that exact question and how possibly can
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
we make a reasonable prudent decision
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
about how much money we can spend in
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
public education if we drain the trust
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
fund before we know the answer to that
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair your
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
statements is
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
inaccurate any money in the general fund
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
can be used for
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
Education representative proii M you Mr
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to address one U I
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify something here that
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill does not say we
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
are transferring 222 million and
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
120,000 to the general fund it says
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to transfer Surplus I agree
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
that there are contingencies that may
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
happen happen that would require us to
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
change the funding for the education
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely true but any of those things
 
00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:36.039 align:start position:0%
can be addressed from the trust fund and
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
that will reduce any surplus that we may
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
have this is why the language says
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
Surplus and doesn't specify an amount
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
specifying an amount would be imprudent
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
saying just Surplus is sound policy and
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
as I said I just wanted to clarify that
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Stringham yeah
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
thank you um I I think any attempt to
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
divert funds away from the New Hampshire
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is going to send a
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
damaging message that our constituents
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
will hear about our commitment to
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
education to do so at this time when the
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
courts have determined that we're both
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
underfunding education and doing so in a
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
way that is harming essential
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
communities particularly low property
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
tax towns will be heard our Educators
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
work tirelessly to provide the best
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
possible learning environment for our
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
students and we owe it to them in our
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
future generations to protect the
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the New Hampshire education
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
trust fund and this is going to be seen
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
as an attack on education even even if
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
we can move money around when we need it
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be perceived that way I
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the right time to do
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
this and um I'd recommend voting against
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
it against a faulty perception let me
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
ask this question how many saw that
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
property taxes go down in 2023 over 2022
 
00:30:56.639 --> 00:30:59.590 align:start position:0%
property taxes go down in 2023 over 2022
anybody

00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
isn't that interesting we gave a 100
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
million from swept we gave 26 million in
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
the retirement contribution 126 million
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
went to all the towns and cities to
 
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the property taxes how much did
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
it reduce
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
them so don't get carried away with
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
exaggerating things about what the
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
public even knows about the education
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund all they know is we fully
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
funded education there's more money
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
available if need be representative Emme
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I want to dispel
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
this the this comment about education
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
funding for adequacy one of the points
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
that was made I'm on that subcommittee
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
and one of the points that was made is
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
we cannot use
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
Surplus to satisfy adequacy adequacy has
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
to come out of funding in the period not
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
from past periods so Surplus like this
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire thank you Mr
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
chairman so we all know that the
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is a polite fiction
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
when we budget we budget the education
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
trust fund and the general fund as a
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
single unit when we look at the Surplus
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
statement for example they're always
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
combined right and so already there's
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
the opposite of this bill in the sense
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
that if the education trust fund was
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
ever low it would get filled to the
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
right amount to the amount needed the
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
amount budgeted from the general fund
 
00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
this is the complimentary piece right
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
that really makes them one unit the
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
reason that the education trust fund has
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
extra funds at this time is simply
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
because the amount put into it is a
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
certain fraction of BPT and a certain
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
fraction of bet and a certain fraction
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
of all the other taxes you see listed
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
here and there's nothing magical about
 
00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:07.710 align:start position:0%
here and there's nothing magical about
those

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
percentages right I mean if the
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
percentage let's say I don't even know
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
what the percentages but let's say it
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
was 30% of the BPT and this year the BPT
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
happens to be a lot bigger than
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
necessary for
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
Education um it's foolish to to force
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
that 30% to be some kind of a magic
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
number that can't be changed right we
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
have a lot of um requirements for
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and provider payments and on
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
and on and on so we balance when we when
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
we create a budget we balance one
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
expense against another we've decided
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
already for this bani how much education
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
should get and how much these other
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
things should get we're we're we're
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
collect ing new bills and new spending
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
requests and having the money in the
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
general fund is the most flexible place
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
to put
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
it thank you those percentages when we
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
left the budget we took 22% of the
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
business taxes into the education trust
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
fund to cover
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
adequacy the proposal that came to us
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
from the governor used
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
35% we sent it on to the Senate at the
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
22% they made it
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
44% twice what we put into would even
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
though we knew that would result in a
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
surplus that's what it did so it tied up
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
money that could be used anywhere else
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
in the budget including education it was
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
a bad decision which I'm trying to
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
overcome with this Bill thank you
 
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.790 align:start position:0%
overcome with this Bill thank you
anything

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
huitt usually I talk so loud nobody
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
anyway um we've been talking about uh
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
education in terms of uh all the
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
different things that go into the uh
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
funding of education and everything else
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
that ISO uh appropriated in in it's in
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
its general
 
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
milu what I've what I've observed since
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
since the whole debate started several
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
years ago uh is discussions about
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
schools and about
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
kids uh and not about how much should go
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
into this fund or that fund of the next
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
Fund in that connection I this is
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
completely uh unexpected uh I'd like to
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
read you a short letter that I received
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
this morning at 10:16
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
a.m. I believe you sit on the finance
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
committee HB 1560 came before your
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
committee on January 29th I believe the
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
bill wants to take money from the
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund and put it into
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
the general fund I hope you oppose this
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
with every ounce of your of your being
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
the ETF is supposed to be used to fund
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
public education and we all know that
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
the state is short changing public
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
education the recent November Supreme
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
Court ruling stated it should be double
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
what it is currently
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
funding what what this points out is not
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily the facts that the letter
 
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
wrer has put out but it's also relating
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
the fact what people have been talking
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
about all this time the problems that
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
have been discussed anytime you mention
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
the educational trust fund or any of
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
that stuff is education kids providing a
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
a good solid education to all of our
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
children and we hear debates that all
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
the time we hear some once in a while in
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
this committee about how we're not doing
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
enough or we're not doing it wrong right
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
or people have done something horrible
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that it's a good idea
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
to just out of a clear blue sky and
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
believe me I'm sorry I wasn't here on
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
Monday um but out of a clear blue sky uh
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
the U legislature steps up and all of a
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
sudden decides that well maybe we ought
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
to take the money out of there and start
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
spreading it around other places where
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
we think we need
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
it uh I haven't heard anybody say that
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we need that is so
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
important that we ought to tell the
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
public well we can't keep the all the
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
money in the education trust fund
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what is going to
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
happen at the end of this FAL year and
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
so I would not be in favor of taking any
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
action that would affect the education
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
trust fund at this time there's a lot of
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
misinformation going around I was with
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
the education trust from from its
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
Inception and there were many years when
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
we Del deliberately
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
underfunded what we even thought was
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy because we wanted to make it up
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
with money from other sources especially
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
the general fund because what we found
 
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
out was if we sent money to the if we
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
deliberately assigned money to the
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed that wasn't needed they
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
spent it
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
anyway and that was what we feared there
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
was one time we we got done we put all
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
the money that we thought we needed into
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
the into education
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then the estimate for the lottery
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
came in 4,000 more 4 million more than
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
we thought it would be and we said what
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
do we do now and we said to the
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
education department anyway we can get
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
this money back no no we'll spend
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
it that's was the reply we got so ever
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
after that we said all right we'll
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
figure out how much they need we'll make
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
it a little less because we know they'll
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
spend everything we send them and by the
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
way we spend more than $45 other states
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
and do we are we at the top of the 45
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
other states no we're not doing that
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
well for all the money we're spending
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're spending
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
$20,000 per public school student while
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
when we have someone in a charter school
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
we spend nine and they still get a good
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
education if they go to education
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
Freedom account they get five million
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
5,000 each and they still are happier
 
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
there than in this education at $20,000
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
per student so it's not being
 
00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:26.990 align:start position:0%
per student so it's not being
competitive

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's not providing what it should it
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
just spends a lot of money without us
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
seeing the effect and I think somebody
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
has probably the teachers union has
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
spread a lot of misinformation that if
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
we take money out of the education trust
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
fund that is not needed in the education
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
department then we're being evil that is
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
such a misrepresentation and such
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
baloney that's been pulled out by the
 
00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
teachers union and others I'm really
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
distressed by that we are here to make
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
sense out of the whole budget and to
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
manage the finances of the state and by
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
saying oh we got to leave money in the
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund even though we have
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
not purposed it anywhere is a big
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
misinformation because I know one thing
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
that might go well over what we thought
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
it would be we put a 100 million into
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
the um the challenges on the Sonona
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
Youth Center the last time we met in in
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal it seems like they're
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
overspending that by a lot more that's
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
something that's already been approved
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of an open thing there's
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
nothing here in education that's open at
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
this time but that's open I know we're
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to be in asking for more money
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
there and I don't want everything tied
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
up where we could use another few
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
million out of Education trust funds
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
that are going that if we put them in
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
the general fund we can cover that
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
that's open it's there it's a commitment
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
all the commitments and education have
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
been funded so all these other arguments
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
are spurious in my
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
mind question representative L new thank
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair um to my
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
understanding the only blank check out
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund is for the
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account voucher
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
program the um adequacy payments are
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
actually defined by Statute so they're
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
not the Department of Education is not
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
able to expend that money willy-nilly um
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's defined in statute the only amount
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
that's a blank check is for
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
vouchers thank you thank
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%

one it looks to me by based on the
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that the monies for
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
Education have been appropriated and
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
nobody's talking about reducing the
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's been appropriated
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
based on what's on the spreadsheet so so
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
the money is there it's fine uh then the
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
second thing is the the
 
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.470 align:start position:0%
second thing is the the
222

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
222
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
million to me the way I look at that is
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is an
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
administrative reservation of
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
funds uh because you administratively
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
reserve funds that's a different thing
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
than actually trying to appropriate
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
money to spend on a program and so where
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
that money sits in its administrative
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
reservation is really not the relevant
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
issue the issue is which programs do you
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
care to fund and and so so I I I'm I'm
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
not hung up on the administrative
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
reservation piece of this the third
 
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
thing is that the Appropriations are
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
programs that have been
 
00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:55.559 align:start position:0%
funded and um and that is completely
 
00:42:55.559 --> 00:42:56.990 align:start position:0%
funded and um and that is completely
distinct

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
distinct
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
from the source of money that may be
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
coming in to say 22% of BP 18% of BPT
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the percent of a
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
revenue number is that's that that's
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
that's when you're looking at Revenue it
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the programs that
 
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
you want to invest in so um so I I I
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
think we really need to look more at
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
programs than we are uh the the the
 
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
source of money and um I I I know I sit
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
in healthc care and not in education but
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
I would love it a lot I would feel a lot
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
better about spending money if I heard
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
about programs that were intended to
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
improve the quality of
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
education education in New Hampshire is
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
not doing all that great from what I can
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
tell from the scores and so if we
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
invested in programs that would make
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
kids smarter I I would I would be up for
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
that conversation
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
um and then um I would say you know we
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
don't know what the future is but I I I
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
could see that we need some flexibility
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
the nation is being invaded uh States
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
all over the country are getting hit
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
with enormous unanticipated bills and so
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
far I haven't heard of New Hampshire
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
having that happen to them but I don't
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
know what what makes us exceptional um
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
the illegal invasion is coming it's
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
going to cost us money we better have
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
some money available so I'm going to I'm
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
going to vote for this uh primarily
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
because I I don't see the connection
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
between an administrator reservation of
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
money and the intelligent application of
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
money to on on actual academic
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
programs any further discussion be aware
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
that we've been cautioned not to go late
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
because we're holding up the staff they
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay overtime
 
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative Petri thank you Mr
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh uh one of the things that
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been mentioned is uh about 10
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
years ago we had about
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
221,000 kids in public schools we we now
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
have about 155,000 so this extra money
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's coming in is being just it just
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
sits there and not helping the kids
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
because adequacy is set in statute like
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
we've heard so I'm going to be voting
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
yes on uh this motion representative bu
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just had a
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
question about how how do we address all
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
these incumbrances against the education
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
trust fund in in RSA
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
incumbrances including adequacy grants
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:52.559 align:start position:0%
in it if required expenditures exceed
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
amounts appropriated then the
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner is is is authorized
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
