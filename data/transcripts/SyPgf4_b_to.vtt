the director of Athletics at the
 
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire thank you
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
for having me Senator Representatives I
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
really appreciate being able to be here
 
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
you have two handouts from me which you
 
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
can look over at your leisure afterwards
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to make sure that you had
 
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
some photos and some information to take
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
away with you from today I'll be talking
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
about the upgrades to the Whittemore
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
Center as you can see on the front of
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
the the photo packet we have a picture
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the snively Arena which was the the
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
former Arena before way to more Center
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
that was 29 years old when it was
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
retired we are now looking at the
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center which is 28 years old
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of our brand new Arena
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
and it's a wonderful place to play and
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
we've been working on the ice and and
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
it's a fantastic place for people to
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
watch a game but the underneath area has
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
not been addressed since it was built in
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
1995 and we're looking at competition in
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
a very tough league as well as across
 
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
the NCAA you'll see that the majority of
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
teams that we compete against have
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
either have already completed run
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
Innovations are in the midst or are
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
about to begin Renovations and so we're
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
the one of the last ones left who have
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
not done that it's hampering our
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
recruiting efforts and our competitive
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
efforts because you know everybody's
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
looking on their phones they're seeing
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
what everybody else has and they're
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
seeing these beautiful new facilities
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
and upgraded facilities that are costing
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
mostly 50 to 70 million dollars although
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
I was just at the University of
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
Connecticut whose facility was an 85
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
million dollar project and Sacred Heart
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
has one that's over 80 million dollars
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
so we're looking to definitely make sure
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
that we're able to be competitive we're
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
looking to bring in the strong student
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
athletes who are looking to compete at a
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
high level and also succeed academically
 
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
and I think that's where we have a
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
really great selling point at UNH is
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
that we have the opportunity for our
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
student athletes to be outstanding both
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
athletically and academically and in
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
anything they choose to do which an
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity they don't have at many
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
other institutions however when the
 
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
facilities aren't looking so great it's
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
very appealing to go to another school
 
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
and be able to win and and I think that
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
they can do what they need to do
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
academically there even if it might not
 
00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:35.899 align:start position:0%
be quite as as easy so we had
 
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative Murray and representative
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
papovichi Mueller as well as Senator
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
Pearl with us last week on a tour and
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
we've extended another invitation I
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
think there's another one coming today
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
if anybody's interested in in returning
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
or coming for the first time for a tour
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the facilities to see what we're
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
looking at there
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
um just to walk you through very briefly
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
the the entire project is about a 30
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
million dollar project it's a
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
public-private partnership we're excited
 
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
about the people that are interested in
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
in contributing uh to the program this
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
would be about nine million dollars in
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
philanthropic donations that we'll be
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
raising uh then it'll be uh 13 roughly
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
13 million from the University that
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
includes some work that's already been
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
started we shrank the ice surface from
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
an olympic size ring to one that's more
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
in line with college standards and NHL
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
standards replace the the boards and the
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
glass with much safer and more
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
up-to-date Alternatives and the sound
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
system which was delayed a little bit by
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh by supply chain is now on its way in
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh next month so on the boat yes it is
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
off the boat finally here but it was on
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
the boat for a while yes so uh so this
 
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
is a the overall project about 30
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars so this is something
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
that we want to do the right way so that
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
we're not back here right away this is
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
something we want to last for another
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
hopefully 30 years if possible but this
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
is something that we think would be a
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
great Boon to the university as well as
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
to the state and we look at Athletics as
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
the front porch of the University which
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
means that a lot of people first the
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
first impression of the university and
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
often of the state since it's a flagship
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
University is of the Athletics program
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
and so we do everything we can to try to
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
bring positive attention to the
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
university to be that great entry point
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
for people to see and for people to want
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
to engage with the university and with
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
the state and so this project would help
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
us with bringing in high high level
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
admissions of high-level students and
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
student athletes those students who want
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
to be a part of something really
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
exciting I hear from many alumni and
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
many community members of how much they
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
enjoyed coming to games as as students
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
and how much they enjoyed being a part
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the the winning tradition that that
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
was and hopefully will soon be again UNH
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
hockey it'll attract strong student
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
athletes who will come to the area from
 
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
all over the world and many of our
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
student athletes do end up staying in
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire afterwards because they
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
fall in love with the place and I can
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
see why as somebody who brand new to the
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
area I've been there since just the end
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
of July and they'll stay and it brings
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
in Revenue to the state we have visitors
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
who come to the games we will be
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
bringing in other concerts and outside
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
events to the arena and be able to do
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
more than we can do now because we are
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
updating the support spaces so a concert
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
can come in and have a green room space
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
where large name big name acts would
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
want to sit before their their concert
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
instead of what's now kind of an open
 
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
area with benches and and getting
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
showers so very quickly just to show you
 
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
what I have in the packet and you can
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
take a look there's some notes
 
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
um on the first few pages we included
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
some some photos this is page five of
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
some of the updates that have been done
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
to the strength and conditioning areas
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh some of our our competitors and then
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
the next page you'll see where we are in
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
the in the wit on page six and you'll
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
see that our players do warm up and
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
stretch in the hallway before games and
 
00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
this is while the carts are going by
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
with concessions food and people are
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
coming in to see the game and the all
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
the Zamboni drivers are around so it's
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a crowded area and our
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
women do the same thing this is a photo
 
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
of the men but our women are in the the
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
same exact situation which also makes
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
you worry a little bit about some safety
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
with who's wandering up and down the
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
hallway the weight room is basically a
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
room as you can see with a couple of
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
machines and not large enough for even
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
part of the team to to participate in
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see the next page on page seven
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
the weight room and and all of that area
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
right now is across the street at the
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
field house that's what's available for
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
all student athletes and so in the snow
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the rain and the wind in the winter
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
in the summer they are going across the
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
street after or before their ice time to
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
then lift weights and do their
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
conditioning and then come back over
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
since their locker room is in the
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center so sweaty and
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
um kind of in the middle of going back
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
and forth for their workouts we don't
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
hear anything from them about it but we
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
do know that would be a plus to be in
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
the same building it would also give us
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
another space where we can space out the
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
rest of our teams we do have 20 teams in
 
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
a fair really small area in the field
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
house you can see the next page has the
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
study areas the mule areas nutrition
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
areas that some of our competitors and
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
then on page nine you'll see our one
 
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
lone student athlete who's watching the
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
TV I guess and the table that we put out
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
before the game with their nutritious
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
snacks to make sure that they're
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
properly fueled for the for the game
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
the following page is the locker room
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
spaces some of our competitors as well
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's a theme of kind of
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
how they're looking now and how
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
beautiful and well lit they are the next
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
page you have our women original women's
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
lockers from 1995 they have not been
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
updated and then the locker room the
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
men's room was updated in 2009 with some
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
private funding which you can't
 
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
experience what representative Murray
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
has experienced is the smell and the air
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
quality in these facilities part of the
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
the money that's coming from the
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
university is to address the HVAC system
 
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:48.779 align:start position:0%
because there is almost no air
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
circulation so you can be literally feet
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
steps from the ice surface and it's
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
about 80 degrees and hockey equipment if
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
you've never experienced it has its own
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
unique Aroma and so it's it's not a very
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
pleasant place to be so that's a big
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
part of this project I'll quickly
 
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
because I want to make sure that Jeff
 
00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
has some time but the training room area
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of our competitors and
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
then you'll see the shared athletic
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
training room in the witch which is
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
based just a room and the cold tub
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's jammed in between the ice machine
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
and the the tubs for the or the coolers
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
for the for the drinks
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
and then I won't take too much time on
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
this to propose reconfigured space it
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
all almost all will be within the
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
existing footprint we're trying to save
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
money here and do this very efficiently
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
and economically the one space that does
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
go outside is the little box on the top
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
right and that's a small bump out on the
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
main level for the strength conditioning
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
area which will then have a view for the
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
ice will allow some branding some
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
corporate sponsorship there and again
 
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
bring in a little bit more to support
 
00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
the project and to support the
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
university and then you'll see some
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
proposed renderings of what our spaces
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
would look like
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
you can see another picture of when
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
we've hosted large con concerts in the
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
past how this ends up looking and it's a
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
wonderful venue to host these events and
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
then of course uh the a photo of when we
 
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
had white out the wait a couple of weeks
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
ago or we sold out two two games in a
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
row for the first time and since 2013 it
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
was an amazing electric environment it's
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
a place where people love to play where
 
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
people love to watch and we'd like to
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
get back there at a consistent level
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
where we have the the student athletes
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
who can be successful and really bring
 
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
some some pride to the university into
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
the state so I'm happy to answer any
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have
 
00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:40.310 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have
questions

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you for the tour
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
it was really really interesting to see
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of that and a surprise thing to
 
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:49.460 align:start position:0%
see it just as an aside the athletes
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
limbering up in the hallway I didn't
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
quite realize when I walked out there
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
that they were doing that but at least
 
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
they were fit and good looking so they
 
00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.990 align:start position:0%
they were fit and good looking so they
are

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.850 align:start position:0%
are
um

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:00.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
a concept that came up I think when
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
y'all were here the first time perhaps
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
the second time and it was a concept new
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
to me and I'm still learning about it
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
and this was the competitive e-gaming
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking for additional return on
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
investment sorts of things how else can
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
this put you out there and the way these
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
things were being discussed it sounds
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
like this is something people go to
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
watch kids play computer games and
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of money in this with this
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
arena with with this I know that you
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
know scheduling with all the different
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
athletic activities and you know sort of
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
the events but would this be a possible
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
arena for an e-gaming competition that
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
would Elevate UNH and do they bring in
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
money would they bring in money to the
 
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.270 align:start position:0%
money would they bring in money to the
university

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
so it certainly could because you're
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
looking for a center-hung scoreboard
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
which we have and the the seats and
 
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%
you're right people do actually come and
 
00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:52.370 align:start position:0%
you're right people do actually come and
watch

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
watch
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
um people compete on in video games and
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot of skill and
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
strategy involved I've learned a lot
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
about this over the last few years it's
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
really interesting but um this would be
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
a venue that would be appropriate for
 
00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
that what it would bring in as far as
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue would be the rental fee however
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
we structured it with tickets but
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
certainly that could be an outside event
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
did you ask your competitors how they
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
funded their facilities
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
combination just like what we're doing
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
there's some privately raised funds some
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
have foundations that are associated
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
with the universities that that give
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
quite a bit to the programs others are
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
private invest a lot of private
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
investment and some State funding as
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
well for those who are State
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
institutions or public institutions
 
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
private Investments they expect a return
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
yes so the return on their investment
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be that they'd have a wonderful
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
Arena where they could come and watch
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward yeah I do I do
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
think you know as far as investment as
 
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
well as what I mentioned about the
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
return that it would bring to the state
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
and to the university as well
 
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.710 align:start position:0%
and to the university as well
sure

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
um you have a lot of support you know in
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
your your Sky Box or those those boxes
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
that go along the edge there
 
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.010 align:start position:0%
that go along the edge there
um

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how to ask this without
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
you know being in delicate sort of about
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
it do they provide a lot of money are
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
the people who are in those boxes paying
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
a good chunk of change to be in those
 
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.990 align:start position:0%
a good chunk of change to be in those
boxes

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
boxes
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
they do pay and that's part of our our
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
media rights deal that we have with
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
learfield so that does bring in money to
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
support the the program but it's all we
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
have a level a threshold where we need
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
to meet what we need to sell as far as
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
those sponsorships so they are corporate
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors who who do Reserve those boxes
 
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.610 align:start position:0%
sponsors who who do Reserve those boxes
yes

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
another question what thank you very
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
much thank you and that's the eight
 
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars in a Governor's budget I
 
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
believe that's in section 9 of house
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
so uh in the section in section eight is
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
the million and a half for the
 
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
blockchain insurance okay and
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
um Jeffrey pack can speak to that and
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
um I am the director for the
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab as well as the
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
coven uh testing facility at the
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
University uh it's kind of a varied
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
experience there um I'll give you a
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
little bit of background on what the
 
00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:39.419 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab is just to kind of
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
give you a frame of reference but we are
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
um what sometimes we refer to ourselves
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
as spin in rather than a spin out
 
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.450 align:start position:0%
as spin in rather than a spin out
company

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
um we are a third party testing facility
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
that specializes in the data
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
Communications space so basically
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere data is traveling back and
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
forth we offer some sort of service to
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
companies who build products there to
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
validate their equipment make sure that
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
it works well and is interoperable as in
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
it works from company a to Company B
 
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
it's the high level thing
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
um we are 100 commercially funded by
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
those business partners we work with
 
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
about 180 global companies in any given
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
year so we are one of the larger
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
corporate facing entities inside the
 
00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:20.210 align:start position:0%
corporate facing entities inside the
University

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
University
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
um so again we specialize in facing
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
businesses engaging them bringing them
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
um bringing them to the university to
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
get some sort of value
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're also a very large Workforce
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
Development facility our Workforce is
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
primarily built of students which is
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
really why we're still inside the
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
university rather than being a spin out
 
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
um so we have about 120 to 125
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
undergraduate and graduate employees in
 
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
any given year and those are the folks
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
who are doing the work our staffing
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
level is about 25 to 30 in any given
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
year they're supporting the students
 
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
doing that training but the students are
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
engaging these companies they're working
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
directly with the engineers we have
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
about a 99.9 placement once they
 
00:23:59.159 --> 00:24:00.169 align:start position:0%
about a 99.9 placement once they
graduate

00:24:00.169 --> 00:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
graduate
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
so we're constantly turning them over I
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
lose a quarter of my Workforce every
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
year which is a crazy way to run a
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
business but that's what we do
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
um we are working in about 40 ish
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
different Technologies at the moment and
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
we are trying to support some of the
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
work that's happening here at the State
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
House in blockchain space basically so
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
there's already some legislation
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
committee I think House Bill 645 is
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
looking at creating a legal status for
 
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh Dao's decentralized autonomous
 
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
uh Dao's decentralized autonomous
organizations

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and this is really an opportunity for
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
us to have a Kickstart one time only
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
support from
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
um the state to basically staff up and
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
be ready to offer services in this space
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
and complementary to what you guys are
 
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that the intention is that after
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
the startup
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
this Center
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
will be funded by
 
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.810 align:start position:0%
will be funded by
um

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
corporations just as all the companies
 
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
that the iol works with now fund that
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
work it's real again it's a it's a jump
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
start infusion let's get the center set
 
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.270 align:start position:0%
start infusion let's get the center set
up

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
based on the work of the cryptocurrency
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
commission and the recommendations
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
again there's a bill moving through the
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
the legislative process and then it will
 
00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:28.490 align:start position:0%
the legislative process and then it will
be

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
funded by external parties uh once it's
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
first I want to say congratulations for
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
the work that UNH was doing with the
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
lake euron and finding the ship in that
 
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.450 align:start position:0%
lake euron and finding the ship in that
program

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I really am just in awe of the
 
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
wonderful stuff that UNH is doing and I
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
have visited your Center and was so
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
impressed with the kids because it was
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
they knew exactly what they were doing
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
they knew what they were talking about
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
who were they with whom they were
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
meeting with
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
the best kind of learning that kids
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
could ever have they were just applying
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
their knowledge to real life situations
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
I think this is a spectacular idea
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
um can you just kind of give me a sense
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
of um the revenue that you're generating
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
that keeps you alive sure so we're
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
currently about eight million dollars in
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue in any given year that's
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
supporting those staff and students were
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
obviously part of the University so
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
we're a non-profit which is why an
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
investment like this is actually very
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
beneficial we don't
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
we're not building up a warehouse of
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
money that we can invest in in new
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
technology spaces all the time uh and
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
then blockchain is uh as I think you're
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
all aware an incredibly large investment
 
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
area for businesses right now and so
 
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
Staffing in this space is expensive
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
great thank you and these funds will
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
give you what you need to develop this
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
aspect so that you can go out and build
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
relationships with corporations exactly
 
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
who will then sell fund this model
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
moving forward and our students will be
 
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.299 align:start position:0%
the ones doing it they will be doing it
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
going off and running the businesses and
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
getting wonderful jobs from it correct
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Mary I was hoping you
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
would ask my question but using words of
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
no more than two syllables can you
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
explain what is blockchain quality
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
assurance sure so blockchain
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
um do we need a blockchain background as
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
well or
 
00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
just a little bit okay so it's it's a
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
method for
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
um having a distributed Ledger system
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
basically is the easiest way to describe
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
this where it's decentralizes and
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
there's not one particular home there's
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
not you know I don't own The Ledger that
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
everybody else is coming and writing to
 
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
there's a way that everybody can access
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
it and write to it it has a lot of
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
utility in a bunch of different business
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
cases outside of traditional models so
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a super high level
 
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
um introductory to that the quality
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
assurance piece uh is uh we act as a
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
third party currently for the
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
technologies that we work with
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
um and this would be the same thing in
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
the blockchain space so companies
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
building products and building chains in
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
this space could come to us to get
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
validation we would then give them back
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
a report or some sort of certification
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
that says yes we observed what you did
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're actually doing what you
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
say you're doing there aren't loopholes
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
or places where attacks could be found
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and providing that Assurance back to
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
people who are making investments in the
 
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
space or evaluating different uh
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
different opportunities for them to
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
invest in so that's the quality
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
assurance piece there's also a huge
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
number of other opportunities in the
 
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.090 align:start position:0%
number of other opportunities in the
space

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
um alongside the quality assurance so
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
I've only heard the phrase blockchain
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
used with regards to cryptocurrency yes
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
so is that the world that we're talking
 
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
in because you were using you didn't use
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
that word once I didn't use
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency because blockchain is not
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
just cryptocurrency okay that is
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
obviously the big utilities where the
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
exciting money is at the moment
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
um but this is some a technology that's
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
actually uh got a whole bunch of other
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
applications that are very specific to
 
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
say you know government
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
um California right now is running a
 
00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:16.070 align:start position:0%
um California right now is running a
parallel

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
parallel
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
blockchain alongside with their DMV
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
process where car registrations and
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
license plates are actually being kept
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
tracked in two different systems because
 
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
they see some utility in moving that
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
into a blockchain rather than their
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
existing system so there's a lot of
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
potential Technologies and business
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
cases for this outside of cryptocurrency
 
00:29:33.779 --> 00:29:36.710 align:start position:0%
cases for this outside of cryptocurrency
itself

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
I have a very stupid question
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
when you're working with all the
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
blockchain parties
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
approximately how many locations do
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
these 180 clients represent so we at
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
we're Global we work with companies that
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
are all across the United States
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
one client could have 50 locations
 
00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
so you don't really know I think we we
 
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
typically are working with one division
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
inside a company but you know these are
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
our typical companies you know think
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
like a Microsoft or an apple they've got
 
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.909 align:start position:0%
like a Microsoft or an apple they've got
offices

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
offices
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know spread out everywhere right so
 
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
we're typically working with one or two
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
departments inside an organization of
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
that scale okay
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
uh this is a strategic question that a
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
financial question
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
you said you you don't have the ability
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
to hoard cash that's my words uh it
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
seems like that would be a better idea
 
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:34.340 align:start position:0%
I mean we have we have two Enterprise
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
operations for the state we have the
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
liquor stores and
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
Lottery yeah
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
the two and I can't think of one of them
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
but that that operate autonomously as a
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
business unit
 
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.669 align:start position:0%
business unit
um

00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
trying to think if they they can't hoard
 
00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:00.059 align:start position:0%
funds either can they
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
we take all their all their profits on a
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
never mind
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
I was trying to find a way that you
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
could have reserved funds well I guess
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
you could have set up a reserve in your
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
current structure yeah and and fund it
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
to follow up on it we do and on
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
technologies that have a lower uh kind
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
of First Step cost we do regularly
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
expand into areas that our customers are
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
following the blockchain space the
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing currently because of the
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
lucrative nature of cryptocurrency is uh
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
very expensive it's really the short
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
story here so it's it's a big leap from
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
what we would typically invest in to
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
attract the right people
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
the FTX Scandal seemed to do a big
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
setback for all this cryptocurrency as
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
well as blockchain and so what were the
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
effects of that in your operation
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
ah so we were not impacted by that at
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
all um and I think uh that's a great
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
example but the state you guys are
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
already doing so things like House Bill
 
00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
645 are going to provide a way to have a
 
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
skeleton where those companies actually
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
have to do reporting they have to follow
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
some of the rules that every other
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
business has to follow which provides
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
that security and this is one piece of
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
that puzzle that will help support that
 
00:32:26.289 --> 00:32:26.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up as a replacement currency it
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
seems a little too volatile which is why
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
even though we've seen a lot of
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
inflation in the US dollar it's
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's more controlled than almost all the
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
other currencies in the world and and I
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
see this one being even more volatile
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
than the US dollar
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
would you agree uh currently I think
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
there's an incredible amount of
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
authority in in cryptocurrencies but
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
again I think crypto well it is today
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
the big piece of blockchain in the long
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
term there are other business cases
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
outside of that that will it has an
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay no more questions thanks for making
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
the trip
 
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
but I'm gonna ask Kathy I might ask you
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
to do me a favor of course
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
we have a bill that came in
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's 529 that has to do with uh a
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
formula for Distributing
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
in house bill 529. in case you want to
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
oh there is a house bill 529 oh
 
00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:47.389 align:start position:0%
oh there is a house bill 529 oh
okay

00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:48.980 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm gonna I was gonna do this
 
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
privately but I think I'd rather do it
 
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.649 align:start position:0%
privately but I think I'd rather do it
publicly

00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh I like that formula not just because
 
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.330 align:start position:0%
uh I like that formula not just because
it it

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
does it does
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
something well
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
it takes available funds and distributes
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
it based on valuation per student of the
 
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.409 align:start position:0%
it based on valuation per student of the
town

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:17.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
exactly yes
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
okay I've I've just um representative
 
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to help in any way I can but
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
this is far outside I have I have made
 
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving you a background okay
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
got it
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
and and as part of the background I I'm
 
00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
from Hampton and we wouldn't qualify for
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
about anything that I'm going to talk
 
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
about so I'm shooting my feet off for my
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
own constituents but I think better
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
distribution of available funds is
 
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.450 align:start position:0%
distribution of available funds is
appropriate

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
the current bill has basically three
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
levels of valuation per student
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
criteria one is less than six hundred
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
two is six hundred thousand to one point
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
six million
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.829 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
I would I would ask you to put your
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
thinking cap on back your treasury days
 
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.690 align:start position:0%
thinking cap on back your treasury days
here

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
and help me develop a formula using this
 
00:35:24.839 --> 00:35:26.150 align:start position:0%
and help me develop a formula using this
concept

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
that we could use to distribute building
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
Aid we could use to distribute all what
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
we're doing here for uh uh free and
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
reduced meals I mean that same formula
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
could be used many places that then
 
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
takes the poor less valued communities
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
it gives them a greater piece
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
and when I I don't have an answer right
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
now but that the greater piece is is
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
that let's say one gets I'm making this
 
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.930 align:start position:0%
that let's say one gets I'm making this
up

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
one gets three times what three gets
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
over 1.6 million you get one third of
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
what somebody in category one gets
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's the concept
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
and what I want what I'm trying to put
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
together is a formula
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know what it looks like
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
but it's just it's got these three
 
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.250 align:start position:0%
but it's just it's got these three
levels

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
and it's for distribution
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
analog if you will
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's your homework assignment if you
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't mind helping me out a little bit
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
Mr G we actually have a formula
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
that we use
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
um David luno has developed it in
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
conjunction with Rick Ladd um and Sally
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
fellows who was here
 
00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:38.829 align:start position:0%
fellows who was here
um

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:41.780 align:start position:0%
reporting actually what you are asking
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
Kathy to do Sally has done
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
um she used to work the New Hampshire
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education she might be a
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
good person to ask to to translate it to
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
the other areas that you're looking at
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
Sally has quite she's a marble with
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
formulas and she's very familiar with
 
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
this okay well
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows it's funny I just
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
ran into her and she's looking for work
 
00:37:07.569 --> 00:37:07.579 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
elevator and
 
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.210 align:start position:0%
elevator and
um

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
I used to work with Sally fellows when
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
she worked for the Department of Ed and
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
I was with with the state and she knows
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
at a much deeper level than I do okay
 
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
eye level so a high level and and deep
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
so I I think she would be
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
an excellent resource I agree I'll
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
connect I'll connect you all right okay
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
thing I mean it could be applied to a
 
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:43.820 align:start position:0%
number of top programs interesting
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me that um for for state aid for
 
00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:52.820 align:start position:0%
whatever local school districts I I I
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
think the key to this when she was
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
presenting it was based on valuation per
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
student all of a sudden hey we've got a
 
00:38:00.839 --> 00:38:02.150 align:start position:0%
student all of a sudden hey we've got a
denominator

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
denominator
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
we finally got a denominator instead of
 
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
planning our feed in midair
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
so I liked I really I was really struck
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
by what common sense that is
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
she actually was just in here asking me
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
if I have anything for her to do because
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
she wanted if I wanted her to put a
 
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.470 align:start position:0%
she wanted if I wanted her to put a
formula

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
let's get in touch with her
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
Kathy thank you anyway
 
00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:30.380 align:start position:0%
congratulations to work
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
today being wombs day I want to
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
congratulate you I think you're the
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
first female athletic director at Uni
 
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire I'm not
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
the first but I'm the first that's the
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
the whole department right not just
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
congratulations it's it's nice to have a
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
woman in that position and
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
congratulations to you all I just am so
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
impressed and my little granddaughter
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
little she's a freshman at UNH and I
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
have never seen such a happy girl she
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
loves every single day of her experience
 
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:02.540 align:start position:0%
at unh so thank you
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
let me asked one other question just
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
came to mind
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
this the 1.5 million is that what the
 
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
Yeah but yeah that's to hire people
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a three year over three years
 
00:39:15.609 --> 00:39:15.619 align:start position:0%
so it's time
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
to say because what happens in year two
 
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:19.820 align:start position:0%
if you don't yeah
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
your Revenue up we'll get it up over the
 
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:24.740 align:start position:0%
three years that's that's why it's over
 
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
all right all right thank you the
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
thinking was that
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
developers thinking recommended by the
 
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:36.829 align:start position:0%
developers thinking recommended by the
crypto

00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
back here and asking for more money you
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
know and after three years we're either
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
self-supporting or we're not yep well it
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
appears here uh it it it's actually
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
appearing here in 23 fiscal year correct
 
00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:56.339 align:start position:0%
right so it would roll I think the
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
intention will roll over the next three
 
00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.550 align:start position:0%
intention will roll over the next three
okay

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much and thank
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for the opportunity
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm glad I asked
 
00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
I'm glad I asked
nope

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
can I add the thanks to Mickey that he's
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
so good at filling our dance card and
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
when our dance card isn't full he's
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
really good he's a very good dance
 
00:40:44.280 --> 00:41:00.290 align:start position:0%
really good he's a very good dance
partner

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
so what part of security are you change
 
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:12.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay sure
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
good guys I'm supposed to harassment
 
00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:32.510 align:start position:0%
good guys I'm supposed to harassment
up

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
a little nepotism there I guess it
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
worked for me I don't think
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
as far as where we finish with UNH there
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
the school building Aid idea so that's
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
something I can help as well kind of
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
work through
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
um trying to come up with if you want to
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
Target some Aid based on some factors so
 
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:44.579 align:start position:0%
this one I just printed off here
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
the school building Aid formula now has
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
Grant determinations based on median
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
family income and equalized valuation in
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
that town that District so I just
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
presented this as there's already a
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
mechanism even relative to school
 
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
building Aid that targets
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
to uh to districts based on free and
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
reduced or if not free reduced on uh
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
income and valuation so that exists as
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
an idea the 529 House Bill 529 structure
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
is an idea there's a bunch of different
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
ways you could Target building a money
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
my thought process is to figure out a
 
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.630 align:start position:0%
my thought process is to figure out a
formula

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
that could apply to all
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
distributions and building Aid and
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
that it becomes its own paragraph
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
and over here it says go use that
 
00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.130 align:start position:0%
and over here it says go use that
paragraph

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
instead of rewriting it all the time are
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
you talking just School building or all
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
Aid programs I'm thinking of just eight
 
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.290 align:start position:0%
Aid programs I'm thinking of just eight
programs

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.910 align:start position:0%
programs
categorically

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
categorically
 
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.470 align:start position:0%
categorically
[Music]

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
so adequacy to like special education
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
tuition transport like everything or at
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
adequacy in the sense of the increase
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah base adequacy stays the same as it
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
has been to everybody the difference the
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
Delta that remains if we if we leave it
 
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
the full amount the Delta becomes new
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
formula okay
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
so even adequacy has has built into it
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.470 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.069 align:start position:0%
I
wasn't

00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:44:49.079 --> 00:45:02.990 align:start position:0%
wasn't
just

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.470 align:start position:0%
 
SE by

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
SE by
 
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.650 align:start position:0%
SE by
no

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:11.660 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
forget you know what I mean because we
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
had talked about we have the Medicaid
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
information by town
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
on percentages of kids that are on fnr
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
um and we had talked about maybe using
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
that number instead of the fnr number
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
we're currently using that we know is
 
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.930 align:start position:0%
we're currently using that we know is
inadequate

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.130 align:start position:0%
inadequate
okay

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's equalized valuation
 
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.589 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's equalized valuation
versus

00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicaid instead of Medicaid
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
you just have the uh
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
equalized values which which is going to
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
give you a percentage
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
and just as a quick note to build on
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
repeats comments I do I do agree with
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that the fnr numbers right now
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
are not accurate and don't represent the
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
you know poverty levels in the towns and
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
whether we you know start using Medicaid
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
or do something else based on valuations
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
or anything in between I think we need
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
to find the best way to fix that formula
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
and frankly I don't you know I think
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're okay changing the formula if we
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
that the governor proposed to something
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
that we feel is more appropriate if we
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
can you know reach a good agreement I
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
think we're all doing something
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
the question is could we resolve it by
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
coming up a formula and then use it
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
the data point of percentage that call
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
could qualify for f and r
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
is just a data point it would have no
 
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
relevance to the formula itself it would
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
say in this town this is the percentage
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
but as far as the distribution of funds
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
I got to think about this I it just this
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
struck me in the middle of night last
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
night that's why I'm like a broken
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
record on this yeah I can't
 
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:11.180 align:start position:0%
I think the fnr is more subject to fraud
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
than a
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
equalized valuations
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
and I mean that we we heard years ago
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
about some superintendent going out and
 
00:47:22.079 --> 00:47:23.630 align:start position:0%
about some superintendent going out and
recruiting

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
people to get more F and our money
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking you know
 
00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
if people need it and they want it they
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
can come in and apply for it and I don't
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
know how
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
how thorough the analysis is to say
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
prove that
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
that was your income
 
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:47.060 align:start position:0%
are you leaving out something
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
I think I think the Medicaid that you're
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
talking about would do that
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
well either one would do it really I
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
mean you're just looking for a
 
00:47:59.809 --> 00:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
percentage it gives you it gives you a
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of well you're you're
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
creating categories with an equalized
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
valuation that's one thing Medicaid
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
would also do it
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
because you're you know how many people
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
are on Medicaid which is the poverty
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
level basically yeah you know you can
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
translate that so I mean it's
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
you could do it either way but the
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
school building Aid could use the same
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
right well but that's it to be the same
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
thing really you're just doing it a
 
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:33.020 align:start position:0%
different way
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
this also uses
 
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
right well that's another issue which
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
can I ask a clarifying question were you
 
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
considering using the equalized property
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
values as the the measure for more than
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
one of these Concepts yes okay so I
 
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
guess the question that I would have
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
then I can see where it might work for
 
00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
some but I'm not sure that that would
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
work for in every instance that that
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
would grab the people I don't know every
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
instance yeah I just want to put it on
 
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:15.260 align:start position:0%
the table here's an idea can we make it
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
more fair if that's the right word
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's all yeah
 
00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
right well yeah no no probably lost my
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
train of thought but uh no this is per
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
valuation per student or as relation in
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
relation to students right which is
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
which is what you got to go by it may
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
not total evaluation I mean you know
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
because obviously Hampton is would be a
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
lot more a greater number per it was a
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
million and a half two and a half
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
million per per person our valuation is
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh 3.6 billion okay 15 000 people but
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
but we got 1800 students I mean I I
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
haven't played with it yet but but that
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
number is in relation to the number of
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
students in other words evaluation of
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
the number of students so you get a like
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's where this like Farmington would
 
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
be around six hundred thousand dollars
 
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
per student let's say okay so I mean and
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
and yours would be you know whatever two
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
and a half million per student which you
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
don't really qualify now so I'm sorry
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
about that I don't qualify now anyway
 
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
there you go I'm not doing anything Dan
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
just a quick Point since we were talking
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
about the Medicaid numbers earlier I
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to remind you that while the fnr
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
numbers are off because of the covid era
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
policies and our Medicaid numbers will
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
be off right now because we haven't been
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
allowed to knock anybody of the roles
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
that would have been knocked off so we
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
also have a temporary Distortion there
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
so in a sense looking at something like
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
529 that kind of takes all those
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
variables out and you know it's just
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
harder to tweak with by anybody who
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
would want to put their thumb on the
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
formula and affect it that seems to be a
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
very hard one to do it with because it's
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
just you know valuations a number of
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
kids and it's a very straightforward
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
thing so I I really you know I'm
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable with 529 as a formula for
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
deciding how to allocate
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
Aid to you know or contributions to
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities based on their
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
educational needs you know even if it's
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
on a broader set but whatever part of
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
the formula deals with a relative need
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
or inability to provide I think that
 
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
would be a good measure to use in
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
different categories
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
yeah very I just want to clarify the
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
process for frame reduced lunch
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
um lunch forms are provided to All
 
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
Families in all districts
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
um who
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
to everybody and those who are eligible
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
can fill them out and they go back to
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
the usually the food nutrition program
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the school district and they are
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
validated they're they're and I think
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
Joe you can speak to this much better
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
than I can because you've actually done
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
some of this
 
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
um they are validated I just I just
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
wanted everybody to realize
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
um who might be listening today that um
 
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.150 align:start position:0%
um who might be listening today that um
people

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
in school districts do go above and
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
beyond to make sure but the problem is
 
00:52:16.859 --> 00:52:18.650 align:start position:0%
beyond to make sure but the problem is
the

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
often the forms are never returned they
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
get lost in kids book book bags they
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
and I think a joke and talk to it better
 
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
than I can yeah I think thank you uh if
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
I may uh like our our town right now or
 
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
our school district is uh we got 760 odd
 
00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.950 align:start position:0%
our school district is uh we got 760 odd
students

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
we are short
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
144 forms from the norm of last
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
from the 2019 statistic because that's
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
what we're using for so that and that
 
00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:53.579 align:start position:0%
and so that what's that translate to
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
about three hundred thousand dollars
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
well that's 75 cents on a tax rate right
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
there and that's we don't know why they
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
haven't turned them in I mean you know
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
you get used to not filling out the form
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
so so then people say well I don't have
 
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
to do that anymore so they you know they
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't do it or or for other reasons they
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
don't want to give their data but it is
 
00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
they take about three percent at the end
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
you know uh well and they're randomly
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
picked to certify to ought to do an
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
audit a random audit and if they don't
 
00:53:28.329 --> 00:53:28.339 align:start position:0%
turn their forms in those those kids
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily will come off the rolls
 
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
because you know if they don't provide
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
Chester right now we're seeing a really
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
serious drop in adequacy funding
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
um number one because we're using
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
different student counts because there's
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
been a reduction after Kobe never fully
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
came back and secondly
 
00:53:52.859 --> 00:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
came back and secondly
um

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
folks got used to not having to fill out
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
the forms so they're not filling out the
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
forms and additionally we have a huge
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
population of English as a second
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
language uh Learners and families and
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
the families we try to get social
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
workers out to them but they haven't
 
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
been completely successful and parents
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason in the world so our
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
numbers are way off in comparison to
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
what the Medicaid count might be and
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
then what our actual fnr numbers are and
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
I have a sense that this is happening in
 
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of places like Manchester
 
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
um you know Nashua might be similar you
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
you Farmington obviously some is worth
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont because school districts just
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
get used to not doing them and so now
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
getting parents to do them again is just
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
that extra hurdle that that we're not
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
getting by well right now and
 
00:54:50.339 --> 00:54:52.190 align:start position:0%
getting by well right now and
unfortunately

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
the formula is really so dependent that
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
epinr carries some weight so our school
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
district says suffering
 
00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
with the funding because the numbers
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
well anyway let's think about it I I
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a an opportunity to
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
partially fix that and I think that's
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
all right Mickey Mouse now it's your
 
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.890 align:start position:0%
all right Mickey Mouse now it's your
turn

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
so so just to kind of piggyback on that
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
conversation we've got a limited amount
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
of time and this is massively complex
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
especially if we're going to cross over
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
a building Aid formula with adequacy and
 
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
you know so whatever Direction This
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
committee wants to go in with all that
 
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
we it'd be nice to do it on the front
 
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
end so we can make sure that I can
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
calculate accurate estimates for all
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
that the spreadsheets and everything
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
um you know we talked about adjusting
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment to frame reduce we talked
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
about uh the governor's proposal which
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
gets rid of stabilization and creates a
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
new hold harmless we've talked about 529
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
which has two brand new components to
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
the Ed funding formula as well as 540
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
which is the special education
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
enhancements representative lad's bill
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of moving pieces with
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if today's going to be
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
the day we're going to dive into it but
 
00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
I'll try to come up with something that
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
can be a useful tool for
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
committee moving forward but I'd say we
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
probably should start zeroing in on what
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
direction you want to go event funding
 
00:56:24.119 --> 00:56:26.030 align:start position:0%
direction you want to go event funding
soon

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair in order for us to
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
make a decision I think it would be very
 
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:33.020 align:start position:0%
useful if we would take a peek at how
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
would the distributions
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
um to the town's work if instead of the
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
fnr if in the fnr portion of the
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
governor proposed budget we would use
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
the formula proposed by 529 instead I
 
00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
think it would be necessary to look at
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
how that will affect Aid you know that
 
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
particular portion of way to the various
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
towns to see whether we do get the
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
overall positive results we all expect
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
because I would expect that to be better
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
and more fair but until we run the
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
numbers we wouldn't know and the quicker
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
we do that you know I I would feel that
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's a good use of time if we could just
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
run that you know substitute in the fnr
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
portion of the governor budget the
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
formula proposed by 529 run the same
 
00:57:19.609 --> 00:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars that the governor
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
suggests for now so we can have on Apple
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
so Apple's comparison so we'd have to
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
change the rate per student but you know
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
and you know see how how that moves the
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
same put the money around and whether
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's more appropriate
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
can I just add with regard to building
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
it I think in the future that's that's a
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful proposal to try and look at
 
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.410 align:start position:0%
wonderful proposal to try and look at
that

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
but I just I just want to go back to my
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
statement that we're just coming off a
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium and there are a lot of school
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
districts that have already gone through
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
the process so I'd like to for this year
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
just honor as much as we can and and
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
hopefully get a few more projects in
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
that could be funded
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
um and not move to a totally different
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
system because I don't think anybody's
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
ready for it we really haven't had
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
public hearings on any of that so just
 
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
to keep the status quo for school
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
districts for this
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
session and then maybe next session
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
start working on that because I think
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
it's a heavy lift moving to something
 
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
oh no doubt about it
 
00:58:22.859 --> 00:58:24.309 align:start position:0%
oh no doubt about it
yeah

00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
oh thank you uh
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
as far as the 529 formula
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
Farmington would get about a million
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
dollars more so that's that's and and if
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
you look at that chart
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh that was provided that's that's quite
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
I mean that's quite significant that's
 
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the governor's
 
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:47.660 align:start position:0%
proposal plus uh
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh stop loss
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
and and the 529 Edition uh usually
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation
 
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.490 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation
information

00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
we are actually last night we did the
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
city budget and we did the School
 
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
District budget and there are
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
significant holes in our education
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
budget because of the loss of adequacy
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
dollars it's significant and this would
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
really help us
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
and just uh make sure everyone
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
understands how the whole harmless works
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
and what putting 529 on top of that
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
would mean in the case of Farmington
 
00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal has 2.3 million
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
dollars of a hold harmless so a
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
Farmington got an extra 1.2 million from
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
the 529 that just means their hold
 
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
harmless would go down by that amount so
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
yep it comes out to what 5.8 million yep
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
but it would essentially be a shift so
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
you'd get the 529 money but your hold
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
harmless would go down
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's that's not what it says
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
which what says if you go across that
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
column the representative fellow sheet I
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that sheet I didn't I
 
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
didn't run that one I don't know that's
 
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
that's the way that 529 if you wanted to
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
craft I mean then
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
we I think we need to have a deeper dive
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
into education funding I think because I
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't think we're ready to do this today
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
right I'm not ready to do this today I'm
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't have anything with me for
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
that but it mean I can't pull something
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
yes could you explain a little more the
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
hold harmless what is being held
 
01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.970 align:start position:0%
hold harmless what is being held
harmless

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
harmless
 
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
in the governor's proposal there's three
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
big changes so there's
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
the uh changes to base adequacy and the
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch portion of
 
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
differentiated those eight amounts go up
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
then also stabilization Grant goes away
 
01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
to hold harmless is set up so when you
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
make all those changes
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
and you compare what that formula
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
computes for each Town to what it would
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
have received under current law with the
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 preliminary estimates that
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
went out the hold harmless would
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
represent any shortfall between the
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal and what they would
 
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
have got under current law so in the
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
case of Farmington they were 2.3 million
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
dollars less under the governor's
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
proposal than current law so there was a
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
2.3 million dollar hold harmless
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
but if we but if we change the formula
 
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
to give Farmington an extra million they
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
would only need a 1.3 million dollar
 
01:01:36.049 --> 01:01:36.059 align:start position:0%
hold harmless but still would get the
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
same amount as their fiscal 24 current
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
law preliminary estimate so hold
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
harmless is what you called
 
01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.210 align:start position:0%
harmless is what you called
stabilization

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:43.220 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's a it's exactly the same yeah it's
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
essentially the same yeah
 
01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
so first I do agree with earlier remarks
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
that the more we can do to chip away at
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
the harmless because you know a whole
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
harmless at the end of the day is a way
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
of saying the formula doesn't work we
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
are going to maintain it for now but we
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
agree that money shouldn't really be
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
there so if if if just changing the
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
formula may not get new dollars but it
 
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
gives a certain Community money you know
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
in the proper pocket instead of through
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
the whole harmless which will go away
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
that in itself is a good thing because
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
it makes the formula better and it
 
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
clearly shows that you know we are
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
really addressing this more nicely and
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
again hold harmless will get go away but
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
I do want to make
 
01:02:29.089 --> 01:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
clear that what I requested earlier as a
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
research and I want to make sure that
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same pages I did not
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
look at the new money proposed in 529
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
for now I just asked for an analysis of
 
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
what would happen if we take the formula
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
from 529 and apply to the current
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
governor budget so we compare the same
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
number of dollars with the same number
 
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
of dollars so we just look at the
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
formula impact any funding changes we
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
can discuss separately but the initial
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
step for me is just same dollars
 
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
allocated to two different formulas so
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
we can see how it moves around I think
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
529 actually has dollars in it I agree
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
it does but the the the project that I
 
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
was asking Mickey for was that same
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
dollar is just the formula change and we
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
can talk about the money separate so can
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
I ask can I ask you a question
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
um my city Manchester so Manchester
 
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
got the additional
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
like this question is does the the I
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
believe the governor's
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
budget does not include the
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
Erin Hennessey funding that came out
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
remember me like my city was given
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
additional dollars for
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
um poverty and and
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
um property values
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe the governor's
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
formula excludes that yeah I should have
 
01:03:54.049 --> 01:03:54.059 align:start position:0%
mentioned the relief relief Aid yes and
 
01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
the third grade reading component that's
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
a small amount those are not in the
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal either yes so so for
 
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester representative
 
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.690 align:start position:0%
Manchester representative
um

01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
in real really what is driving the whole
 
01:04:07.089 --> 01:04:07.099 align:start position:0%
harmless is the stabilization Grant
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
elimination so Manchester for instance
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
has a stabilization Grant of
 
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.170 align:start position:0%
has a stabilization Grant of
so

01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:17.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
12.5 just about 12.5 million dollars
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
so in the new formula the governor's
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
proposal Manchester has a hold harmless
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
of 3.6 million so essentially the
 
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
changes in the formula
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
could increase Manchester about 9
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
million but when you took the
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
stabilization away you still needed a
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
new stabilization to keep you at the
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
same funding level
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
same idea for Farmington
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
in many other towns so when you're when
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
you compare the new the increase in Aid
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor to the loss of
 
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
stabilization for many towns that
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
it wasn't enough which is what resulted
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
necessitated the hold harmless so no
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
town would have less money you'd have
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
yeah according to this 529 chart here
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
Manchester would uh increase by about 12
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars from
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh 62 million to around 75 million so
 
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's and the and and it's Governors
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
have to hold harmless
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
and current RSA plus 529 which is
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
stabilization I I as I would understand
 
01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.849 align:start position:0%
stabilization I I as I would understand
it

01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest I did not look at
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
representative fellows data so I can't
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
speak to that but that that's what
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what it says here so I
 
01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:33.059 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I don't I don't know I don't
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
know how I I don't know how she got her
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
numbers I'll be honest I trust her
 
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
implicitly she did this for a living and
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
she's very good at it I says I don't I
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
think she also may have done that prior
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 2 coming out so I don't
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
know if she made an assumption that she
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
did you know so so I don't I just can't
 
01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
speak to that I've just been going off
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
of my my calculations I did them
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
independently to doe we came up to the
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
same place so that's kind of what I'm
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
working off of right now okay
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
do we do we have that yeah Department
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
had provided that okay when they had
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
come in the 28th I think the afternoon
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
or the 28th so we have that
 
01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.270 align:start position:0%
or the 28th so we have that
okay

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
looking at what Sally fellows passed out
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
and I can share with you if you don't
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
it shows State total
 
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
current RSA 598 million
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
Governors beforehold harmless is 566
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
million so even though he says he's
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
giving more per pupil it appears that
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's less when she throws out all these
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
other things and then the governor's
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
after hold harmless is 653.
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
and then current RSA plus HB 529 it goes
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
up again another 40 million to 694 so
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
you know the things at the top I'm
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
looking at I I would say the biggest
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
difference between the governors and 529
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
is the stabilization Grant 529 does not
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
remove the stabilization Grant so that
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
is going to be above and beyond versus
 
01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
netting against the loss of a
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant and I think that's
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
that's the the big difference between
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
what is in the governor's proposal in
 
01:07:13.619 --> 01:07:21.490 align:start position:0%
what is in the governor's proposal in
529

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
is gone it it would net it would if you
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
increase the made you're just going to
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
eat into how much hold harmless you have
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
to give or new stabilization we'll call
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
it so there's a netting going on so
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
that's why I think when Mark had given
 
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
numbers yesterday
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
he had said it's a little bit less than
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
what representative fellow said and
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's because yeah there's more money
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
going to be in this new Aid component
 
01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
529 which means we just have to give
 
01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
less hold harmless but that Town's still
 
01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
going to get the same amount of money as
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
just 529 plus hold harmless it's just
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
gonna be less hold harmless so there's
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
no State net increase some towns may you
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
may have some town that that 529 was
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
just enough to exceed their whole
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
harmless so they're going to get more
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
but in those two examples I just gave
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
Farmington and Manchester they're not I
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
can guarantee Berlin is not another one
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
there there is another one that just
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
because they have a huge stabilization
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
adding these new components in 529 would
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
not exceed or reach how much their
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
yeah it wouldn't reach into that right
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
now but given that the plan is to hold
 
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
that stabilization Grant you know until
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
everybody catch up that town would catch
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
up faster in the future and would get
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
additional funds earlier if we make
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
those changes versus the current Formula
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
where they would be you know have to
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
make up more stabilization Aid so I
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
agree that if we just look at this
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
biennium they may not be impacted but it
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
will accelerate their ability to
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
increase funding in the future presuming
 
01:08:59.169 --> 01:08:59.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
and I think we're not going to solve
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
this this morning and I think would be I
 
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
think Mickey has a whole long list of
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
things we really got to get to I think
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
this is good to discuss it I just didn't
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
come prepared with it today that's why I
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
feel a little uh you know not helpful so
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh no representative is correct that uh
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
the governor is proposing a 10-year plan
 
01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
with the phasing out of the hold
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
harmless with an enhancement to the
 
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant which is based
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
on equalized valuation per free and
 
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch pupil so over time there
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
should be a shift
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
I am only running this biennial budget
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
at this point so we we have not I don't
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
plan to do a 10-year analysis on this
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
with the time that we have so this
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
document actually was representing
 
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
fellows yes
 
01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.050 align:start position:0%
fellows yes
okay

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:47.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
wow and yeah and while I completely
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
agree that we should focus on this
 
01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:54.410 align:start position:0%
agree that we should focus on this
biennium

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
when we do talk about formulas that will
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
be presumably presumably part of the
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
statute for an extended period of time
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
even if we don't have hard numbers it is
 
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
useful to understand at least at a
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
qualitative level what the impact will
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
be without the need to have dollars and
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
cents you know at a very accurate level
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
but and I think doe did provide a a line
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
graph that they showed at the bottom
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
which is total and you can see that
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
shift over time
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's not something I
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone's gonna have a town
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
by town for to see what happens in 2028
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
for instance was not asking for that at
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
all okay
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh so I I did appreciate that
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
conversation because that's been on my
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that's one of the biggest
 
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
things on division two's plate is Ed
 
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
funny it always is so just having the
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
dialogue about I think is good and
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
productive and you know continue to work
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
through that one uh so it's only a
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
billion dollars only a billion dollars
 
01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
so I do have an updated packet it's not
 
01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
that different than the last time we
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
sent this out it has the binder clip on
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
it uh the first the first document is
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
exactly the same this is our house bill
 
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
2 houseboat one back of the budget
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
sections and House Bill 2 uh assigned
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
sections I don't know Mr chair if you
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to go through and
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
just check off what what might be ones
 
01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
that there's a general consensus for and
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
just uh as well we're gonna have to do
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
it at some point for instance in my
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
opinion nothing's going to get easier
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
than the house bill one back of the
 
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
budget section so these are sections of
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
law that essentially make the budget
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
work one of them is the lottery
 
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
commission's authority to purchase their
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
their tickets and the other is just the
 
01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
I call it cleanup agencies will have
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
abolished vacant positions that are put
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
forward we didn't hear from any of the
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
agencies to change what is in house bill
 
01:11:43.729 --> 01:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
one that came over from the governor so
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
to me sections four and five of house
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
bill one you could probably accept as
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
they came to you
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
I didn't know we were going to do any
 
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
voting today oh it's fine I don't yeah I
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think any voting we would
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
do today would be uh oh you mean from
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
Clark's point of view I'm sorry yeah oh
 
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.630 align:start position:0%
Clark's point of view I'm sorry yeah oh
it's

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:07.580 align:start position:0%
and this is just more of our tentative
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
Choy hands type thing probably works for
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
me to
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
um do what does Janet need a record of
 
01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
this well I
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
think usually I can put it in the
 
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
well you could just you probably could
 
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
just use the sheet
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
yeah okay here but you know five zero
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
yeah as a queen up got it because that's
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
what we're doing cleaning up the dock
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah so we have a motion to for
 
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
items for the Lottery Commission and for
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
yeah section four and five page seven
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
section four and five yep all those in
 
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.970 align:start position:0%
section four and five yep all those in
favor

01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
above

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay everybody okay
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
all right and just so everyone knows how
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
when when I prepare this document again
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
for Friday yeah I'll I'll have in that
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
column accept or something along those
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
lines so it's clear you're making no
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
changes to the bill as it came to you
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
and then you'll know that oh that's off
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
our plate
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how if we wanted to talk
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
any funding at this point so a lot of
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
the sections in House Bill 2 are
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh We've do one
 
01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment the program
 
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
changes relative to that we had house
 
01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.030 align:start position:0%
changes relative to that we had house
bill

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:13:35.169 --> 01:13:35.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean the the this
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
is what the governor proposed 2 million
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
we also had another bill that had 3.25
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars for
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
doing concur enrollment that was also
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
the Community College systems request
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
so this is still a two and a half
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
item so I'm not sure if we're in a
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
position to do that today
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think so probably not is my
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
guess yeah you also have a section
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh section two or excuse me six and
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
seven relative to the community college
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
system they had come forward with
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
language the governor supported it to
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
essentially have employees hired after
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024 not be part of the
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
retirement system we haven't heard from
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
specifically on that because they came
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
in before hb2 was introduced they did
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
suggest that was in there so I don't
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
know if
 
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we wanted to have the
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
community college system in for a
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up on some of their items it's up
 
01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
to you Mr chair I don't
 
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
if you call them and ask them a question
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient for me I'm dragging
 
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
you gotta turn your mic on Mike Mike
 
01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.669 align:start position:0%
you gotta turn your mic on Mike Mike
okay

01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
I am not in favor of it because it
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
reduces the um number of Union employees
 
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
at the community college so for me I
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
just am not comfortable acting on that
 
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
just now
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
so we can skip
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the U.S or the UNH
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
um Appropriations we heard we just heard
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
from them on those I don't know it's a
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
lot of money it's nine and a half
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium it's all
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
charged a fiscal 23 Surplus
 
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
whether you support that those funding
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
those Appropriations at this time or you
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
still want to keep it depressed
 
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
so but again what's anybody's sense of
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
that of these two items we just heard
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
from UNH I'm fine with the two items um
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm sorry there are two people
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
who aren't participating in this but I'm
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
you know I suspect they would be fine
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
with it too although I shouldn't speak
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
for them but I'm fine with these two we
 
01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
have underfunded the university system
 
01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
for so long
 
01:15:59.930 --> 01:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and this is an opportunity I feel
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
like that we can do something
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
both the Whittemore and the um uh
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
whatever they call it blockchain they're
 
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
both Revenue generating items that will
 
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
allow them to not come back to us so
 
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
often they're going to be making more
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
money from these they're kind of like
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise so I I support them and I
 
01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
hope that when we get to the line the
 
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
operating line we can bring the
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
university system back to the 100
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we had back in
 
01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
2011. yeah I want to add that this we
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
consider this not as a replacement for
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
increasing the basic line for the
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
University because I would still support
 
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
that and personally because it's a lot
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
of money and we still don't have a clear
 
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
handle on the revenues and whatever all
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
the other budget pieces go and also we
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
need to understand what our overall
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
goals are you know as a finance
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
committee and then kind of see what each
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee each you know division
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
needs to do I would want to wait on
 
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
voting for a large ticket items
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of the topic just until we
 
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
understand the priorities and uh you
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
know what what whatever our strategy is
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
our budget this is unaffected this is
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm looking at it right but
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
if it's hb2 for this year you can you
 
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
know using funds that you know go in the
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
2023 or could affect what we're doing 24
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
and 25 we could you know decide I'm not
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
talking about this particular item but
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
in general right
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
there is nothing to stop up stop us from
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
saying something that the governor wants
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
in 24 but it has non-lapsing in 23 if we
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
have the funds there but we don't have
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
the funds in 24 and 25. so I just want
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
to wait a little bit until we have a
 
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
better handle of priorities before we
 
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
talk about any big ticket items
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
regardless of the topic well one thing
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
though I think it's
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
when you have a budget there are a lot
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
of things you want to buy and you figure
 
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
out what it is you want to buy
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then you hit find out how much money
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
you have and then you go back and you
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
say well I only have this much money I
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
can only buy this many things and that's
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
by saying that we're all in agreement
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
about certain things we can say okay we
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
all like this if we have enough money we
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
can buy it so I think it's just if we
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
can like kind of get a consensus and
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
then when you find out how much we can
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
spend then we can say well we as much as
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
we like it we can't do it
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
does that make sense yeah and I would
 
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
add that we always you know this is a
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
first pass we go back once we have the
 
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
money and we'll say okay you know we'd
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
like to this but we need to we're going
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
to need to cut a million here and there
 
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
and so we go back and revise the budget
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
but this is the first pass to say yeah
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
if we have the money this is something
 
01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
we definitely want to do uh we'll come
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
back we're going to come back over this
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
at least two three four times
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
I'm if we're going to go back and forth
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
I would suggest we try to prioritize and
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
say is this priority one two or three
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
maybe three would be sufficient and as
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
we go through each of these decide what
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
the priority is and agree to that and
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
then move on to the next one okay I
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
think it probably yeah I think it sounds
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
like we probably should hold off on that
 
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
and just a reminder all of these are
 
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
already in the governor's budget the
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
next the next document we'll get to will
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
be the add-ons but this is already
 
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
already included everything else in
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 we're going to be hearing
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety and Dot
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
today which will will hopefully get us
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
in a good place to to feel good or or
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
not about these items and then I'm going
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
to schedule the Department of Education
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
to come join us next week uh I'm not
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
sure the day yet it's going to depend on
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
I think we've got some full committee
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
things that we're going to get scheduled
 
01:19:59.570 --> 01:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
the other the last thing relative to
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh our assignment in House Bill 2 that
 
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
is not an agency specific if you jump on
 
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
the second page all the way to sections
 
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
210 and 211 and this is what we talked
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
about the the shift in the uh
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
distribution of business taxes between
 
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
the general and education trust fund
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
so depending on where the the education
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund is and uh what this
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee's policy is that's got to be
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
determined at some point but I don't
 
01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
think we're ready to do that today
 
01:20:29.699 --> 01:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
think we're ready to do that today
either

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
so some of these appear to be non-cash
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
items yes you want to want to just deal
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
with the non-cash owners we can I don't
 
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
know if you want to hear from the
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
departments on them first like many of
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
many of dots I don't think are directly
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
related to the budget but they're going
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
to come in with explanation as to why
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
they need those and that's today so even
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%
if we don't Circle back this afternoon
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
because I think we've got a stop at time
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
today uh we can certainly do these uh
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
Friday we'll be informed then we can
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
roll through on Friday
 
01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.610 align:start position:0%
roll through on Friday
oh

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
okay and even on a non-cash item in
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
today's budget technically if we decide
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's not a priority even though they
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
are not requesting money we could be
 
01:21:15.169 --> 01:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
able to you know remove some funds that
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
would have otherwise been used for this
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
if needed so even non-cash items unless
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
they are very minimal you know I would
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
wait a little just to see what
 
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
flexibility you're coming in right
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
they're going to speak to these items
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
exactly so I'd rather have that
 
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
information yeah
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
so on the next page the busy uh
 
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet looking page I you will see
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
some shading uh we we've made a couple
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
changes here mostly technical in nature
 
01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
we did add the fish and game position
 
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
you see that on line 32.
 
01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
on here everything does touch Highway
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
and general funds with the exception of
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
we did get a late uh dot correction
 
01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
request on line 40. so this actually has
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
a net zero it was similar to something
 
01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:00.020 align:start position:0%
we had done for uh
 
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission I think it was
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
where there's just a source of funding
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
issue in the budget so
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
there used to be a revolving fund set up
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
for this accounting unit now it's not a
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
revolving fund that fund was repealed
 
01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
but it is dedicated restricted Revenue
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
so it's really just a revenue class code
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's a Beyond technical in nature it's
 
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
very technical so if the committee is
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
okay with line 40 I can make that change
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
and it sure won't even really notice it
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
but it's something I'd still want
 
01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
to know you I did it yeah
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
you gotta go for it all right excellent
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
everything else on here is is general or
 
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.910 align:start position:0%
everything else on here is is general or
uh

01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
Highway except for if you look at lines
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
19 and 20 for the Department of Safety
 
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
this this comes out of what we refer to
 
01:22:49.729 --> 01:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
as the fire fund and when the department
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
of safety comes in today they'll be
 
01:22:53.209 --> 01:22:53.219 align:start position:0%
talking about their house bill two
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
sections which include changing the uh
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
how the fees on the motor vehicle
 
01:22:59.530 --> 01:22:59.540 align:start position:0%
certified record copies is handled which
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
indirectly relates to this so I think we
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
got to wait and see what we decide to do
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 2 before you'll know the
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
affordability of those uh those sections
 
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
I updated this based on yesterday's
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
action so we moved virtually all of our
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
bills up to retain now for Budget
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
consideration we still have the two EFA
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
bills pending we got scheduled for a
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
work session again on Friday at 10 to
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
vote on those uh I I'm I don't know if
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
we wanted to go through these bills that
 
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:41.699 align:start position:0%
have retained to at least see if there's
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
consensus for me to go forward and start
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
drafting amendments or if you want to
 
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
wait for another time for that because
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
many of them do have money associated
 
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
well we have a better idea of what
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
the budget is
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
and we've got Ways and Means and we've
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
got the governor so now at least we have
 
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.310 align:start position:0%
got the governor so now at least we have
numbers

01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
so if these are retained what what
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
action are you looking forward from us
 
01:24:23.159 --> 01:24:24.770 align:start position:0%
action are you looking forward from us
today

01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
so if if you want to support them and
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget them put them in the budget so
 
01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
some of them we retained and I'll pick
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh let me see I'll pick on
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 560. the contact note of
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
person notification program which was a
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
bill we retained the bill included uh
 
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
five fifty thousand dollar appropriation
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Safety to update
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
their system for this database for the
 
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
contact uh folks is that something that
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
committees and I want to include right
 
01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.310 align:start position:0%
committees and I want to include right
now

01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
page two of the the busy spreadsheet oh
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that that bill was a
 
01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
consent calendar bill in the house
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
so the way we left that work session is
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
we retained it for Budget consideration
 
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
so the question is do you want it in
 
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
your budget do you want me to go forward
 
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
draft an amendment you know and and we
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
don't have to do this today but as I've
 
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
I've collected all these bills here for
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
Budget consideration at some point I
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
just don't want them to fall through the
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
cracks if if the committee does want to
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
fund these and put them in House Bill
 
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
too we do need to drive them Governor
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
has a building a budget line
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
for building a yes yep so we could adopt
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
budget yeah so if you wanted to support
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's position on school
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
building Aid these three bills we just
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do those cool building a bills
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
would just may still be retained and uh
 
01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
and you'd move forward with what's in
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
we've got we've got to make Cuts
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I don't there's a lot of
 
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
money going into building Aid which we
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
cannot afford because what I saw and I'm
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
sure Mickey will agree
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
what ways and means gives us is 80
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
million dollars less than what the
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so when we look at
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
some of these bills we've got to be
 
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
making Cuts rather than additions
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the money
 
01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.149 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the money
what

01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
my attention quickly focused on 75
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
million that became available June 30th
 
01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.250 align:start position:0%
million that became available June 30th
2025.

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
to me that makes no sense at all
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I'll start there
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
and say forget that so now we're down to
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
13 million
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
yes so that's section
 
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
s 165 and one
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
through 167 in house bill 2. so if
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's if if the committee you know has
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
a consensus of not supporting that 75
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
million dollar dedicated for you know we
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
would take those sections out and I'm
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
just going to jump to the two pages
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
ahead and the packet I just gave you the
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.010 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
picture

01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
so if you look at line 37 of this that
 
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
75 it looks the educational custom
 
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.950 align:start position:0%
75 it looks the educational custom
snapshot

01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
snapshot
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
so 75 million dollars that row would
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
essentially become zero right which
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
would have a corresponding increase to
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
your ending balance of the education
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's it's sections 165 through
 
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
167 and House Bill 2 are relative to
 
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
's going to talk to the chair of
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
so capital I would say that should go to
 
01:28:18.179 --> 01:28:24.110 align:start position:0%
so capital I would say that should go to
Capital

01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:29.290 align:start position:0%
 
included

01:28:29.290 --> 01:28:29.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
there's yeah there's there's no CT
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
renovation or Construction in the
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
capital budget there's not and I believe
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
the department has
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
brought up so there's one for the Sugar
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
River Valley uh in in House Bill 2 paid
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
for with education trust funds I believe
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
there is a second project but I don't
 
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
know the status I think it's gonna Squam
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh but I don't know if that's locally
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
approved I don't have all the details on
 
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
that but I think that was brought up at
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways the second
 
01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.550 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways the second
project

01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
I don't believe I don't know I don't
 
01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
five right yeah the governor just
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
changed the policy on this it proposed
 
01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
the policy change to have this paid
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
forward yeah opposed to that policy
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
change and I think this is way better
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
handled under cap this is where it
 
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
belongs and I think I I feel there's
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
sort of an end run that's being
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
attempted here uh we don't have the
 
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
processes to go through this it needs to
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
go public work so I'm very happy to move
 
01:29:36.729 --> 01:29:36.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like this is an exception to
 
01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:48.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
if if the if the desire is to fund this
 
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.930 align:start position:0%
if if the if the desire is to fund this
renovation

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
we would need definitely definitely need
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
to coordinate with public works and
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
highways so if you do if you deleted
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
that from host Bill 2 we can't tell them
 
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
to put in house bill 25. so as long as
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's clear between the two committees
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
what's going on we can do we can do
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
anything we can
 
01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:14.219 align:start position:0%
so if if this is all set can I go back
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
and ask about the you know 75 million uh
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
you know uh for the building Aid at the
 
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
end of the year the page 59 section 165
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
to 167 because I thought when we were
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
talking about it I think everybody was
 
01:30:29.209 --> 01:30:29.219 align:start position:0%
saying that they would be comfortable
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
striking that out for now
 
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that if everybody is
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
on board we may as well take care of it
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
and uh you know because we know we'll
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
have to find more savings anyway and
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to building Aid because
 
01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
we have a big discussion about it but I
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody here feels that
 
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
that's really the right way I think we
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
agreed to strike that one so then 15
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
page 59 sections 165 167 for the 75
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
million transfer
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
that is gone for now and I will I will
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
point out if you go if everyone has
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
their house bill too and you go to uh
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
so section 165 that starts on the
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
previous page establishes the dedicated
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
account for school building in the 75
 
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.610 align:start position:0%
account for school building in the 75
million

01:31:21.610 --> 01:31:21.620 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
166 makes a couple other changes
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
including a relative to a facility
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
assessment so I just want to make sure
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
that you want to not do any of this
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
before we just go ahead and wipe out
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
like if you wanted to because there's
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
other things happening in here besides
 
01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
just a straight 75 million dollar I have
 
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
no problem with administrative shifts or
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
whatever the other things are it's just
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
that money come popping up the last day
 
01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:46.580 align:start position:0%
of the biennium
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
facility assessment is that what we
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
asked for actually what uh
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd was looking for for
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
the the assessment on all the buildings
 
01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
I I think more or less I don't think
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
it's exactly married to the bill from
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
from last time uh if you jump to
 
01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
um line 28 you'll really see the you
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
know to comply with the requirements the
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
Department of Education shall contract
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
with a vendor to conduct a facility
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
assessment of public schools and Charter
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
Public Schools to create a ranked list
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
of schools so there's there's work here
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
and presumably some of that 75 million
 
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
would have gone to doe to to do that
 
01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.270 align:start position:0%
would have gone to doe to to do that
requirement

01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and we we can ask the department
 
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
about that when we get them in here I
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
think at the very least it sounds the
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee has the cons is
 
01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:36.260 align:start position:0%
has consensus to not do the special
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
State Building Aid account with the 75
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
million as far as this facility
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
assessment perhaps we can talk through
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
that with the Department maybe that
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
might remain but the 75 million portion
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
comes out I agree with you completely
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
yeah the other thing
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
um and I guess we'll talk about this as
 
01:32:57.169 --> 01:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
well at the top of the page there's the
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
The Proposal was a 75 million coming out
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund and going
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
um building fund and I would like to
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's no sense of
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund money being
 
01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.350 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund money being
used

01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the building fund or you know that
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
those are two different pots and I
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily want to but does do
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
we take money out of the education trust
 
01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
fund for building up for the past three
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
bienniums we've done that we have
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
um put building Aid into the trust and
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
we've used the trust as a source of
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
building Aid yes which goes into the
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
building yes okay yes just to clarify
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
there is no school building Aid fund
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
this was being proposed in this so if
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
you don't do this there's no building
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
Aid fund there's just a line in the
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
budget from the education trust Center
 
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
but there's no fund for school building
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
Aid yep
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund has grown
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
Beyond its Inception it was just for
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
adequacy and as it grew because the
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
business profits and so on were growing
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
we had all this extra money we would
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
really be in a world of hurt if we came
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
out with we put 60 million surplus into
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
an education trust fund
 
01:34:11.689 --> 01:34:11.699 align:start position:0%
and was short 60 million somewhere else
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
in general fund we've got to change the
 
01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
formula my suggestion had been and I
 
01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:17.390 align:start position:0%
formula my suggestion had been and I
think

01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
LBA might be working on it is to take
 
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
out the peace that comes from the
 
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
business profits and business Enterprise
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
tax the governor reduces it in here it
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
goes from 50 to 35 percent I think if we
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
took it out altogether there would still
 
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
be enough money in the education trust
 
01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
fund for adequacy and we would go back
 
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
to all these other things that we always
 
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
took out a general fund anyway
 
01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
but this 75 million to me it appears to
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
be well this is money that would go in
 
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund we'll just
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
throw it into building Aid
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
but you know I don't I don't think
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's the best arrangement I think we
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
should need to reduce what goes into
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
education trust fund which isn't needed
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
for education
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
adequacy because that's the design of
 
01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
the thing that's what got us through the
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
court system
 
01:35:04.129 --> 01:35:04.139 align:start position:0%
Court didn't argue that we had to put it
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
in building Aid and special ed and
 
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation they didn't
 
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
care about any of that they just wanted
 
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
to make sure adequacy was covered that
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
was the whole purpose of the education
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
trust fund and it's gone beyond its its
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
use so we've got to bring it back in I
 
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
feel so we have more flexibility in
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
general fund spending we definitely need
 
01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.450 align:start position:0%
general fund spending we definitely need
that

01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
you what I feel that I don't agree with
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
you I see your point you're ready to
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
spend every last dollar on education but
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
when can't afford it thank you I am I
 
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
know you are
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
I think that's another discussion in
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
terms of looking at that but I see your
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know I totally see your point but I
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
am not sure this is the the way I would
 
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.850 --> 01:35:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
right uh I I have a question on that and
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
if there if the education trust fund is
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
short then it would come out of General
 
01:35:59.689 --> 01:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
funds anyway so so that that kind of
 
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
just

01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
to be clear I I at the end of the day we
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
decide what gets spent on education by
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
the way I mean the overall you know
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
finance committee in the house and
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
everybody involved but regardless of
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
what the account the trust fund is an
 
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
accounting device nothing more it's one
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
pocket or the other and I I do happen to
 
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
agree with you know chairman Weiler's
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
point that by putting stuff that can go
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
in the general fund into a pocket where
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
we cannot touch it for what we may
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
decide our greater needs at the time
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're limiting the flexibility and
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
creating more HB to work every year and
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's just gonna end up overridden in
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
every way I mean it would make sense as
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
long as we fund it appropriately which
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
is our duty to do and you know we have
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
to it wouldn't hurt to look at changing
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
the revenue that goes into it to get
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
more flexibility than general fund but
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
it's way too early to decide right now
 
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
again I just want to look at way more
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
numbers but in principle I think the
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
idea has married I think we have way
 
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
more work to do and that isn't
 
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
in our purview right now so that would
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
be like taking on another argument as
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned Mickey can we
 
01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.930 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned Mickey can we
proceed

01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what point you're making
 
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
my point is I don't want that to happen
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
I do oh oh the reduction of so we we're
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
we're agreeing to disagree I don't
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
believe that we are right now at a point
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
where we're going to start talking about
 
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
changing taxes that go into the trust
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do our work
 
01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.410 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do our work
oh

01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
part of hb2
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
it's on page 17. my my opinion only
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
don't pay 75 about
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's on page 75 section uh 210. yeah
 
01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.330 align:start position:0%
it's on page 75 section uh 210. yeah
210.

01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
210.
 
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
and 211.
 
01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.470 align:start position:0%
and 211.
um

01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
sorry no I I just I have a new topic but
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if this topic was uh yeah
 
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
we're done I just had to clarify what I
 
01:38:02.689 --> 01:38:02.699 align:start position:0%
just wanted to check if we made a
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
decision on hb560 that contact person
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
notification the 50 000 that was passed
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
on a Voice vote
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
I mean it's 50 000 it was passed on a
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
void Voice vote it came out of committee
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
190 is that something we need more time
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
it right okay
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
so we all concur
 
01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
I think you know I just gotta find where
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
to record that hang on oh you can do it
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
so so where I would track that for us
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
next time is if we go to just back to
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
that first house bill 2 schedule
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
on page two down at the bottom there's a
 
01:38:49.729 --> 01:38:49.739 align:start position:0%
House Bill two amendments new so I'll
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
list amendments that we draft that are
 
01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:54.659 align:start position:0%
not changing existing sections right
 
01:38:57.649 --> 01:38:57.659 align:start position:0%
down there so we'll track everything
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:15.179 align:start position:0%
safety didn't ask for that this this is
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
the result of a bill that came to us and
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
looking forward right yeah we briefly
 
01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
discussed it with with the commissioner
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
and director Lavoy on the first when
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
they were in uh we'll have them in again
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
today if anyone has any follow-ups but I
 
01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
think they were good they don't think
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
they'll object to us having approved it
 
01:39:30.719 --> 01:39:32.990 align:start position:0%
they'll object to us having approved it
yes

01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.110 --> 01:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
stuff off the table so if there's no
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
other questions on the bills and I will
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
I will update it when I am working on an
 
01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
estimate for the placement of the
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
episode of treatment payments from the
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill we heard yesterday uh Rebecca Ross
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
from HHS came and saw us after lunch as
 
01:39:50.209 --> 01:39:50.219 align:start position:0%
far as how much would be associated with
 
01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
that so I'm still working on that but
 
01:39:53.209 --> 01:39:53.219 align:start position:0%
once I have a number there I'll update
 
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
this to let you know how much that bill
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
would cost as far as how much to carry
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
as a budget adjustment for that bill I
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
think what I heard in the lobby was 2
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
million something but again that's a
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
Lobby number not a did we make a
 
01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:08.699 align:start position:0%
decision to um include that in the line
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
where court order placements will go so
 
01:40:13.129 --> 01:40:13.139 align:start position:0%
that's that will become an additional
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
item under that
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
so we would have to we could so
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
certainly that that accounting unit is
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
called court ordered placement so
 
01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps we rename it just so it's clear
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
or a line I could figure out
 
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
mechanically how to make that work in
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
the budget the decision for you would be
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
just uh do you want it to be the same
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
funding source which is
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
under current law General funds under
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal education trust
 
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
funds so court ordered placements
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
changes where it comes from in this
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
budget before you so you just need to
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
make it clear whoop which uh fund you
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
want those to come from yeah I would I
 
01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:50.219 align:start position:0%
would try to take it out of general fund
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
and be a little bit more careful of
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
everything in education trust fund is
 
01:40:59.770 --> 01:40:59.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.410 --> 01:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
trust fund yeah what's that and not load
 
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
up the trust funds no not load up to
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
trust fund because as I said when we
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
created it in about 2 000 it was because
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
we were being sued that we weren't
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
adequately funding education so we said
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
all right here's here's the formula this
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
is what we need this is going to go into
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
this education trust fund we set all
 
01:41:26.930 --> 01:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
those things up and we deliberately
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be less than what it would
 
01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
take so it because it went over that
 
01:41:33.649 --> 01:41:33.659 align:start position:0%
money couldn't be used anywhere else
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
right okay but if it was little under we
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
could put in general fund about shaking
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
the world too much but if it went over
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
that money was lost for everything else
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
now it's become just a funding source
 
01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
yeah and so for Education yeah for
 
01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:47.810 align:start position:0%
yeah and so for Education yeah for
education

01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
it was set up to defend Us in the
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
Claremont soup and if we keep that in
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
mind that was his origin that was why
 
01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:57.659 align:start position:0%
it's there it's not there to build up
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
this huge thing that we can say we can
 
01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
use it here we can use it there we can
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
put more building a no leave it for what
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
it was created for representative I
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
would like to remind you that we have
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
two current lawsuits in place right now
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
that will always go on lawyers
 
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
can I ask I hate to be the one to bring
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
this up in the past there's never been
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
will for retroactive building Aid and
 
01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:23.699 align:start position:0%
bless representative Cahill for bringing
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
it back every year and working so hard
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
to do that but you know we've got the 33
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium here and is
 
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
there do you think there's flavor for
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
retroactive funding of building Aid this
 
01:42:39.129 --> 01:42:39.139 align:start position:0%
this session if there isn't then
 
01:42:42.770 --> 01:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
and frankly
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
I just want to say I I talked to Michael
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many times about this
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
he's very very fervent
 
01:42:52.570 --> 01:42:52.580 align:start position:0%
um to get that money for his community
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
but it has never ever been the practice
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
Amy said she'd do it if she work if we
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
said that she had to but I just think
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
we've got all these projects they knew
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
when they built that building that
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
building Aid was in a moratorium and
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
they knew they didn't go through the
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
process I feel terrible about it he's
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
fighting hard for it and he should be
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's the it's Community but
 
01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's retro it's not and never has been a
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
practice that we retroactive pay for
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
building Aid and well
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
is as somebody who's been the you know
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
chairman of the school board in Windham
 
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
when we passed our project which would
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
be one one of those that would benefit
 
01:43:40.129 --> 01:43:40.139 align:start position:0%
you know I cannot justify asking the
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the state to pay for what the
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
town of Windham agreed to pay for
 
01:43:46.129 --> 01:43:46.139 align:start position:0%
knowing full well they were not gonna
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
get any any amount of tax dollars
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much nicer it would
 
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
have been if we received some we knew at
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
the time we agreed to it as it is I
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it's morally you know okay
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
for me to you know as much as I want to
 
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
represent my community it's not you know
 
01:44:03.729 --> 01:44:03.739 align:start position:0%
the kind of the presentation I can
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
provide and you know
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
so I think that it is perfectly
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
acceptable to remove the retroactive uh
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
portion of that deal I I wouldn't oppose
 
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
so does that change the it doesn't
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
really change anything we're just not
 
01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
adopting anything or so I mean would it
 
01:44:30.649 --> 01:44:30.659 align:start position:0%
would it benefit the committee if I just
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
removed that bill from this working
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
document moving forward okay
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of other retained bills
 
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
that we can use
 
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
yeah if we want to change anything with
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the building Aid we can amend one
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the other bills uh we actually would
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
probably just do it right in House Bill
 
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
too oh yeah fine either way so all these
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
are really just on here for just
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
remembering the proposal we're not going
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
to use those as a vehicle I don't
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
believe at this point we'll use House
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
Bill too yeah okay
 
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
keep reminding me of that my mind keeps
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
going a different direction there's
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing wrong with doing
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
that it's just in my opinion keeping all
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
of your proposals and your budget
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
package to one and two keeps it clear
 
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
sometimes you need to pass a bill
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
separately with money for whatever
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
reasons but most of these I think if
 
01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
you're going to do school building Aid
 
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
you would just take care of it now spell
 
01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.750 align:start position:0%
you would just take care of it now spell
two

01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
so that would apply also to 529
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah 529 540 uh we would we would
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
handle that in the house bill too as far
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
as as part of the education funding
 
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
um so if if there's no more questions on
 
01:45:46.729 --> 01:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
the retain bills I will jump down real
 
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
quick those other items so these are not
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily agency requests these are
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
just things that have popped up so we
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
had heard from the Department of
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
Education about perhaps carrying a
 
01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
number on this education trust fund
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement relative to the snap
 
01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
eligible population that is not in their
 
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
data sets to calculate but will be in
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
the payments that they make for Ed
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
funding they don't have true data on
 
01:46:11.890 --> 01:46:11.900 align:start position:0%
that yet because it's just just began
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
they had estimated if we had held 10
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars in fiscal 24 and 20
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
million dollars in fiscal 25 to just
 
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
cover whatever that cost could be that
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
would be a number that they'd feel
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
comfortable with they don't want to
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
have the education trust fund not
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
recognize that and then not have
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh funds in there to make
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
the payments but they do anticipate Ed
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
funding will be a little bit higher and
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's just the number they're
 
01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.129 align:start position:0%
that's just the number they're
estimating

01:46:40.129 --> 01:46:40.139 align:start position:0%
estimating
 
01:46:40.139 --> 01:46:41.629 align:start position:0%
estimating
okay

01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
once there is a maintenance of effort
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
thing as well in this feds fund most of
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
it this this was if you recall uh fiscal
 
01:46:51.169 --> 01:46:51.179 align:start position:0%
had approved a plan change I believe and
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking out at darn here with HHS
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
related programs but that snap went from
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
185 to 200 uh and that was approved by
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh in the winter sometime and
 
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
what that will do starting payments
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
going out next year uh any child who was
 
01:47:08.450 --> 01:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
in between 185 and 200 would hit the
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch counts therefore
 
01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
adequacy would be more doe doesn't have
 
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
the data to do in the spreadsheets now
 
01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
to recognize those students so they're
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
saying they think it might be 10 to 20
 
01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the next two years so
 
01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
let's plan on that carry a budget item
 
01:47:27.649 --> 01:47:27.659 align:start position:0%
reflecting that just so we're covered
 
01:47:30.290 --> 01:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
it would be prudent to do so because we
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
know the expenditure will be there and
 
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
we should set aside the best estimate we
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
have for those funds that comes out of
 
01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.870 align:start position:0%
have for those funds that comes out of
the

01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
distribution yes that would essentially
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
be when when the actual spending happens
 
01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
it'll be out of adequacy right but we
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put it in the budget as
 
01:47:51.290 --> 01:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
adequacy we would just carry it on the
 
01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement as an appropriation
 
01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:59.930 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:05.050 --> 01:48:05.060 align:start position:0%
okay so where does that go
 
01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
79 here snap I see it
 
01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:11.219 align:start position:0%
otherwise I see it yeah
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
so just if you're keeping score at home
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
if the 75 million comes out and now
 
01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
we're gonna Reserve 30 million for this
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's a net 45 essentially so that
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
bottom bottom line I'll change the
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for the next time we meet
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
uh we had heard from the Department of
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
Transportation that they felt the lapse
 
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
estimates in the governor's budget and
 
01:48:32.689 --> 01:48:32.699 align:start position:0%
the highway fund were a little high so
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
they had provided what they feel would
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
be a revenue estimates that they are a
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
lapse estimates they'd be comfortable
 
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
with that could possibly come up today
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
when when you have them in if you wanted
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
to bring that up after the house bill
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
two sections
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh row 81 so I added this on here uh to
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
reflect the house Ways and Means Revenue
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
estimates so as you know Highway block
 
01:48:57.410 --> 01:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
grants apportionment a is paid to cities
 
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:00.179 align:start position:0%
and towns based on the prior years road
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
toll and motor vehicle fee is collected
 
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
so under the house Ways and Means
 
01:49:07.729 --> 01:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates fiscal 23 revenues for
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
Highway fun were 4.2 million dollars
 
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.850 align:start position:0%
Highway fun were 4.2 million dollars
higher

01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
which means in fiscal 24 12 of that will
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
be paid out to cities and towns so we
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
just need to budget for that so you the
 
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
highway fund you picked up 4.2 million
 
01:49:22.729 --> 01:49:22.739 align:start position:0%
dollars in your your total picture of
 
01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:24.659 align:start position:0%
Revenue but we have to pay out 12 of
 
01:49:27.649 --> 01:49:27.659 align:start position:0%
that or 504 000 in fiscal 24. so this
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
would be an increase to Dot's budget but
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's just passing through to cities and
 
01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:33.229 align:start position:0%
it's just passing through to cities and
towns

01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect General funds
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
this this to me is somewhat of a
 
01:49:40.729 --> 01:49:40.739 align:start position:0%
technical thing it's just yeah it's it's
 
01:49:44.410 --> 01:49:44.420 align:start position:0%
to comply yeah exactly yeah
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
I think you can do that one today too
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
is that one the committee is good with
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
is that one is that your yeah okay so
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'll shade those out and record those
 
01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:01.370 align:start position:0%
I'll shade those out and record those
changes

01:50:01.370 --> 01:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's about where
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
where we're at
 
01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.010 align:start position:0%
where we're at
um

01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
I do have the fish and game fund and the
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
highway fund Surplus statements on here
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
but they're really not that different
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:18.719 --> 01:50:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:33.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
there is a bill associated with it so
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
this is section
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
oh it's an hb2 sections 86 through 88
 
01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
on page 32
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:06.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:51:06.189 --> 01:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.629 --> 01:51:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's sections 86 through 88 of um HB of
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
hb2 right
 
01:51:31.729 --> 01:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.739 --> 01:51:33.649 align:start position:0%
 
like

01:51:33.649 --> 01:51:33.659 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:51:36.729 --> 01:51:36.739 align:start position:0%
I will just say that personally you know
 
01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
given the broad representation of the
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
people on the commission
 
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
I would be in support of that at the end
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
of the day Civics it's basic stuff it's
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
remind you know teaching
 
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
just the basic facts about how
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
government works and everything to me
 
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's not something I would object to
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
but of course if not everybody is ready
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
to discuss it yet we can wait until we
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
have the full membership available and
 
01:52:04.129 --> 01:52:04.139 align:start position:0%
all that but I I personally am looking
 
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
at it and I'm reading the language and I
 
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
just don't see anything there that I
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
would see as uh
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
you know a lightning rod for something
 
01:52:13.619 --> 01:52:15.290 align:start position:0%
you know a lightning rod for something
yeah

01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
most history books
 
01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
kind of give short shrift in New
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and within the within the
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
history of our country it has played a
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
very important role both in the
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War both in the Civil War
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
we we sent 21 regiments to the Civil War
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of people we lost from this
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
state it as a matter of fact
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
at the time we went from
 
01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
family cemeteries to you'll see Union
 
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
cemeteries all over you'll be driving
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
through any little town Union Cemetery
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
why is it a Union Cemetery because they
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
fought for the Union
 
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
and they many of them were young people
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
that hadn't developed a family plot yet
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
so they all of a sudden these towns all
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
had to create Union cemeteries for all
 
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
the people that got killed in the Civil
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
War that didn't have a family plot and
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know people don't realize that the
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
importance that this state play Live
 
01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:12.659 align:start position:0%
Free or Die and all this stuff that they
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
don't teach that if you buy a regular
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
history book they won't even mention New
 
01:53:19.209 --> 01:53:19.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the 13 colonies
 
01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
this isn't this isn't a history book
 
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a Civics book so there's a
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
difference between the History part of
 
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
it and the Civics part of it and um how
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
happy to look more into it but I do have
 
01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
a problem of the legislature getting
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
very involved in state curriculum and if
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's a history book that's one thing but
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's not the same thing necessarily as
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
a Civics book and Civics is taught in
 
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
history it's taught in literature it's
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
taught in philosophy it can it be taught
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
anywhere so who's you know honing it
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
down is kind of a problem to me to say
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
that this is what Civics is going to be
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then the other part I get a little
 
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
concerned is that I can see going
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
forward someone's going to say who's
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
going to evaluate that this is the right
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
Civics book from the legislature and
 
01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:05.219 align:start position:0%
again taking away that freedom of
 
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
education for teachers who are teaching
 
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
Civics in their classes in their you
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
know within the confines of what they're
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
doing they're teaching the left-wing
 
01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:14.930 align:start position:0%
doing they're teaching the left-wing
version

01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
which is is not you just said history is
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
history destroying our culture you just
 
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
said history is history and no it is not
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:37.139 align:start position:0%
so that section as well as other
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
education related sections I do plan on
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
having doe come in because they did give
 
01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
some late budget changes they want plus
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
I think hearing from them on a lot of
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
these House Bill 2 sections will be
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
helpful so a day next week I haven't
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
figured it out yet we'll we'll have them
 
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.430 align:start position:0%
figured it out yet we'll we'll have them
back

01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
all right we have somebody that won uh
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
dot at one and safety schedule to come
 
01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
see us around two okay and in my mind
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to be out here by three
 
01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:14.510 align:start position:0%
we're going to be out here by three
awesome

01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:16.219 align:start position:0%
and I will say
 
01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
today I will say we we still are in
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
budget work session this afternoon right
 
01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
so as we roll through items with the
 
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
Departments if you're good with them and
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
you want to just check them off your
 
01:55:28.129 --> 01:55:28.139 align:start position:0%
list and show our hands is good we can
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:55:29.820 --> 03:02:37.550 align:start position:0%
do that
foreign

03:02:37.550 --> 03:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:40.130 --> 03:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
Transportation here and prepared to walk
 
03:02:42.050 --> 03:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
through House Bill 2 sections relative
 
03:02:53.349 --> 03:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:55.309 --> 03:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon thank you for having
 
03:02:56.809 --> 03:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
me for the record I'm Bill Cass
 
03:02:59.450 --> 03:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the dot with me are
 
03:03:02.090 --> 03:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
Andre Briere our Deputy Commissioner and
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh Danielle Chandra nay our Director of
 
03:03:05.279 --> 03:03:07.010 align:start position:0%
uh Danielle Chandra nay our Director of
Finance

03:03:07.010 --> 03:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
03:03:08.570 --> 03:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
um you should be able to help me with
 
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
any questions if
 
03:03:18.349 --> 03:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:21.290 --> 03:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
I think the first section would be uh
 
03:03:38.210 --> 03:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:40.309 --> 03:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
so if it would help I can just uh step
 
03:03:42.170 --> 03:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
through them one by one and give our
 
03:03:45.290 --> 03:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
rationale for the requests so
 
03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:46.070 align:start position:0%
rationale for the requests so
um

03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:49.670 --> 03:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
so our first request has to do with the
 
03:03:51.610 --> 03:03:51.620 align:start position:0%
um appeals board
 
03:03:55.969 --> 03:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do is um
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate the rail appeals board enroll
 
03:04:00.830 --> 03:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
their functions into the transportation
 
03:04:03.290 --> 03:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
appeals board the rail appeals board has
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
not met for many years historically it's
 
03:04:08.349 --> 03:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
been difficult to find Qualified
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
individuals with real experience to fill
 
03:04:12.469 --> 03:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
03:04:15.889 --> 03:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
so I think by removing that and
 
03:04:18.110 --> 03:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
enrolling their responsibilities under
 
03:04:20.410 --> 03:04:20.420 align:start position:0%
the overall Transportation appeals board
 
03:04:24.290 --> 03:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
will be more more efficient and easier
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
to just manage one appeals board so with
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:33.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:37.550 --> 03:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh calls for uh again some changes in
 
03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
the um compensation I mean in the
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
composition of the of the um
 
03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the Transportation appeals
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
Board number 120
 
03:04:50.399 --> 03:04:54.349 align:start position:0%
Board number 120
um

03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
just there you know just kind of
 
03:04:56.399 --> 03:04:57.889 align:start position:0%
just there you know just kind of
modifies

03:04:57.889 --> 03:04:57.899 align:start position:0%
modifies
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
um modifies the uh duties of the of the
 
03:05:04.910 --> 03:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
um transportation appeals board and
 
03:05:08.990 --> 03:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
um number 121 is a repeal of the section
 
03:05:13.010 --> 03:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
that eliminates the rail appeals board
 
03:05:13.020 --> 03:05:14.210 align:start position:0%
that eliminates the rail appeals board
okay

03:05:14.210 --> 03:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:20.570 --> 03:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
all all those who would support this
 
03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand
 
03:05:23.220 --> 03:05:29.630 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand
okay

03:05:29.630 --> 03:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:32.210 --> 03:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
so the next item from the Department
 
03:05:34.510 --> 03:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
um is number
 
03:05:34.520 --> 03:05:36.290 align:start position:0%
um is number
122

03:05:36.290 --> 03:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
122
 
03:05:36.300 --> 03:05:38.269 align:start position:0%
122
uh

03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:05:42.290 --> 03:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna get my correspondence here
 
03:05:42.300 --> 03:05:43.429 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna get my correspondence here
so

03:05:43.429 --> 03:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:43.439 --> 03:05:44.809 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:05:44.809 --> 03:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we uh are
 
03:05:49.610 --> 03:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
proposing with this is the establishment
 
03:05:53.929 --> 03:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
of a revolving fund for the uh oversized
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
overweight permit fees we have a system
 
03:05:56.160 --> 03:05:57.610 align:start position:0%
overweight permit fees we have a system
that

03:05:57.610 --> 03:05:57.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:06:00.230 --> 03:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
oversized overweight permitting
 
03:06:02.389 --> 03:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
um there are some fees that that go into
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
that and support it right now we
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
maintain the system out of our existing
 
03:06:12.050 --> 03:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
operational budget if there are any
 
03:06:13.969 --> 03:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
additional fees
 
03:06:16.429 --> 03:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
um they they just kind of lapse to the
 
03:06:18.769 --> 03:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
highway fund what we would propose here
 
03:06:21.170 --> 03:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
is to establish a revolving fund so that
 
03:06:23.929 --> 03:06:23.939 align:start position:0%
the permit fees that that we get can can
 
03:06:27.230 --> 03:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
be kept and carried forward to uh for
 
03:06:28.610 --> 03:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
the maintenance the overall maintenance
 
03:06:30.969 --> 03:06:30.979 align:start position:0%
of the of the system
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
and allow us rather than depending on
 
03:06:37.370 --> 03:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
the operational budget allowing us at
 
03:06:38.929 --> 03:06:38.939 align:start position:0%
that resource because as we go forward
 
03:06:42.170 --> 03:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively new system but there's
 
03:06:45.530 --> 03:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
annual maintenance cost and um down the
 
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
road there will likely be upgrades and
 
03:06:48.960 --> 03:06:49.730 align:start position:0%
road there will likely be upgrades and
um

03:06:49.730 --> 03:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:52.250 --> 03:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
just um
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh keeping up with with software
 
03:06:56.690 --> 03:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
requirements and stuff so this would by
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
by putting into a revolving fund would
 
03:07:00.110 --> 03:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
provide the
 
03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:01.490 align:start position:0%
provide the
um

03:07:01.490 --> 03:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:03.290 --> 03:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
means to keep it a self-supporting
 
03:07:03.300 --> 03:07:04.490 align:start position:0%
means to keep it a self-supporting
system

03:07:04.490 --> 03:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:07:04.500 --> 03:07:06.469 align:start position:0%
system
bushes

03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
bushes
 
03:07:08.330 --> 03:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
about how much money goes through this
 
03:07:08.340 --> 03:07:11.090 align:start position:0%
about how much money goes through this
fund

03:07:11.090 --> 03:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
um do you happen to know Danielle I
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't know off the top of my
 
03:07:16.190 --> 03:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
head but I can get you that answer
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
03:07:18.240 --> 03:07:20.750 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
sure

03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would Hazard to guess it's not
 
03:07:24.590 --> 03:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars I think it might be
 
03:07:26.929 --> 03:07:26.939 align:start position:0%
you know ten tens of thousands of maybe
 
03:07:29.389 --> 03:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars but I that's
 
03:07:31.690 --> 03:07:31.700 align:start position:0%
a speculation don't don't quote me
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not I know it's not Millions
 
03:07:36.790 --> 03:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's um
 
03:07:39.349 --> 03:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
I'm remembering it being fairly minor
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
money yeah so but I'm just curious as to
 
03:07:41.760 --> 03:07:44.150 align:start position:0%
money yeah so but I'm just curious as to
anyway

03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
I apologize I don't have that answer any
 
03:07:50.090 --> 03:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
all committee members or support this
 
03:07:54.010 --> 03:07:54.020 align:start position:0%
action oh
 
03:07:58.730 --> 03:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
I I I apologize I I meant to
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
um I meant to note that
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
um we do have one minor change to the
 
03:08:04.560 --> 03:08:06.170 align:start position:0%
um we do have one minor change to the
wording

03:08:06.170 --> 03:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
wording
 
03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.730 --> 03:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know if I I can I can pass
 
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
these around if you want but one of the
 
03:08:26.750 --> 03:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
things that uh the way it reads now
 
03:08:30.110 --> 03:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
it reads in that first statement
 
03:08:31.969 --> 03:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
um hereby established an over length
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
over width and over height uh revolving
 
03:08:37.250 --> 03:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
fund we want to add to that description
 
03:08:37.260 --> 03:08:39.530 align:start position:0%
fund we want to add to that description
overweight

03:08:39.530 --> 03:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
overweight
 
03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
so it would read establish an over
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
length over width over height and
 
03:08:47.090 --> 03:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
overweight revolving fund it's a little
 
03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
Clarity of of the language because it's
 
03:08:51.050 --> 03:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
you we typically refer to as the
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
oversized overweight program and after
 
03:08:55.250 --> 03:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
we submitted this and rereading it
 
03:08:56.809 --> 03:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
realized that it didn't necessarily
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
reference the overweight but that's a
 
03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
big part of our program yeah I can draft
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
that probably if the committee is good
 
03:09:05.630 --> 03:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
with that I can draft that and I have
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
copies of that change but it is what I
 
03:09:09.429 --> 03:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
kind of read okay
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
about the overweight can we charge them
 
03:09:12.479 --> 03:09:14.769 align:start position:0%
about the overweight can we charge them
more

03:09:14.769 --> 03:09:14.779 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
that hurts our roads too it does and
 
03:09:19.490 --> 03:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's why we have the we have those um
 
03:09:21.889 --> 03:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
fees established thank you yeah through
 
03:09:24.290 --> 03:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
rulemaking right
 
03:09:27.230 --> 03:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay with with the amendment uh
 
03:09:29.570 --> 03:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
everybody in favor
 
03:09:29.580 --> 03:09:38.809 align:start position:0%
everybody in favor
okay

03:09:38.809 --> 03:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:40.730 --> 03:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
um so moving on
 
03:09:43.250 --> 03:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
um our our third item has been number
 
03:09:43.260 --> 03:09:44.990 align:start position:0%
um our our third item has been number
124

03:09:44.990 --> 03:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
124
 
03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:56.150 align:start position:0%
124
um

03:09:56.150 --> 03:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:57.769 --> 03:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
it's the same it's the same word
 
03:09:59.769 --> 03:09:59.779 align:start position:0%
reference yeah yeah
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
this should be added to there as well
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
too yeah yeah I'm sorry yeah I rolled
 
03:10:05.809 --> 03:10:05.819 align:start position:0%
those together but they both refer to
 
03:10:10.490 --> 03:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:13.010 --> 03:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
and they should both read the same
 
03:10:19.490 --> 03:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:21.650 --> 03:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
so moving on to our third item uh number
 
03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:23.990 align:start position:0%
so moving on to our third item uh number
124.

03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
124.
 
03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:25.790 align:start position:0%
124.
um

03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:28.969 --> 03:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
03:10:31.250 --> 03:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
adding an exemption to allow Highway
 
03:10:32.929 --> 03:10:32.939 align:start position:0%
surveillance on the little Bay bridges
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
in Dover and Newington for security
 
03:10:37.010 --> 03:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
purposes it was really kind of a it's
 
03:10:38.929 --> 03:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
not really an extension but it's kind of
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
a um
 
03:10:43.969 --> 03:10:43.979 align:start position:0%
uh a clarification to me what what is uh
 
03:10:43.979 --> 03:10:45.290 align:start position:0%
uh a clarification to me what what is uh
existing

03:10:45.290 --> 03:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
existing
 
03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:45.950 align:start position:0%
existing
um

03:10:45.950 --> 03:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:47.210 align:start position:0%
um
being

03:10:47.210 --> 03:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:10:47.220 --> 03:10:47.870 align:start position:0%
being
um

03:10:47.870 --> 03:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:50.570 --> 03:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
actively worked on in in the piscatica
 
03:10:53.210 --> 03:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
river so working with the homeland
 
03:10:55.849 --> 03:10:55.859 align:start position:0%
security and others we monitor for
 
03:10:58.610 --> 03:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
security purposes the the major bridges
 
03:11:01.309 --> 03:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
over the piscataqua river
 
03:11:04.250 --> 03:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
um including the the little Bay Bridges
 
03:11:04.260 --> 03:11:05.090 align:start position:0%
um including the the little Bay Bridges
um

03:11:05.090 --> 03:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:07.309 --> 03:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh for whatever reason that has never
 
03:11:10.130 --> 03:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
been part of the statute but it's part
 
03:11:12.230 --> 03:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
of the practice uh working with Homeland
 
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
Security in the Coast Guard and others
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to clarify and and make
 
03:11:19.849 --> 03:11:19.859 align:start position:0%
sure that our practices met what what
 
03:11:21.889 --> 03:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
was in statute questions from the
 
03:11:22.969 --> 03:11:22.979 align:start position:0%
community here
 
03:11:25.849 --> 03:11:25.859 align:start position:0%
thank you um is that just authorization
 
03:11:28.730 --> 03:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
or is there a fee attached to that it's
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
just authorization thank you yes
 
03:11:34.190 --> 03:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:11:35.690 --> 03:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
members of the committee in favor of
 
03:11:37.610 --> 03:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
this item
 
03:11:37.620 --> 03:11:44.929 align:start position:0%
this item
okay

03:11:44.929 --> 03:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
the next item number our number four
 
03:11:49.309 --> 03:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
which is number 125
 
03:11:49.319 --> 03:11:50.809 align:start position:0%
which is number 125
um

03:11:50.809 --> 03:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:54.230 --> 03:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
deals with um Prime Wetland designation
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this request of change
 
03:11:59.690 --> 03:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
is to specify that uh defined Wetlands
 
03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
or their adjacent buffers
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
are not within the state highway rights
 
03:12:06.590 --> 03:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
of way an Associated permanent easements
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
so this this change we look at is
 
03:12:11.690 --> 03:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
clarifying that the department does not
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
need to adhere to these stricter Wetland
 
03:12:16.670 --> 03:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
requirements for Prime Wetlands when
 
03:12:18.410 --> 03:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
performing on normal Highway Maintenance
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
along State Highway right-of-ways
 
03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
this change has been part of other
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
um other pieces of legislation dealing
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
with Wetlands definitions
 
03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:31.790 align:start position:0%
with Wetlands definitions
um

03:12:31.790 --> 03:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:33.769 --> 03:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
generally supported but it hasn't been
 
03:12:37.730 --> 03:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
passed because of other issues with some
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the delineations and some of the
 
03:12:42.889 --> 03:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
other controversy with some of the other
 
03:12:42.899 --> 03:12:43.790 align:start position:0%
other controversy with some of the other
um

03:12:43.790 --> 03:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
Wetland statutes and changes that were
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
going on but right now Prime wetlands
 
03:12:52.250 --> 03:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
are are not necessarily based on the
 
03:12:55.750 --> 03:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
function and value they're more of a
 
03:12:58.250 --> 03:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
political type of designation that
 
03:13:00.910 --> 03:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
afford them greater
 
03:13:02.830 --> 03:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
greater protection
 
03:13:05.450 --> 03:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
it has been problematic on some of our
 
03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
projects when when Prime Wetland when it
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
when a community had defines a prime
 
03:13:14.809 --> 03:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
Wetland that that does reach into
 
03:13:14.819 --> 03:13:15.849 align:start position:0%
Wetland that that does reach into
um

03:13:15.849 --> 03:13:15.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:19.610 --> 03:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh the nhdot right-of-way
 
03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
um because without it it does
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
theoretically limit what we can do in
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining our ditches maintaining the
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
normal right-of-way so
 
03:13:31.790 --> 03:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
um this would be a kind of a
 
03:13:33.950 --> 03:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
clarification or an exemption of that
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
that Prime Wetland designation within
 
03:13:39.050 --> 03:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
the highway right-of-way
 
03:13:40.429 --> 03:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
of course yes
 
03:13:42.910 --> 03:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
I am I'm looking at that thank you for
 
03:13:45.050 --> 03:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
taking the questions in reading the
 
03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
language I find it hard to understand
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
exactly what it does you know because I
 
03:13:55.370 --> 03:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
could really do say that you cannot
 
03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
touch Prime Wetlands that are in a right
 
03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
or away or that Prime Wetlands shouldn't
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
be considered you know
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
so which is the intent to allow you to
 
03:14:06.170 --> 03:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
continue using your con existing
 
03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
easements regardless of whether some
 
03:14:09.769 --> 03:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
part of that becomes a you know
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
designated as a prime Wetland or not or
 
03:14:14.210 --> 03:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
is it to say that you cannot touch prime
 
03:14:16.010 --> 03:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
lens even though you may have an
 
03:14:18.410 --> 03:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
easement on them already I genuinely I'm
 
03:14:19.849 --> 03:14:19.859 align:start position:0%
not sure what the language is meant to
 
03:14:23.410 --> 03:14:23.420 align:start position:0%
say the language is meant to exempt
 
03:14:27.050 --> 03:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
the prime Wetland designation within
 
03:14:27.060 --> 03:14:28.670 align:start position:0%
the prime Wetland designation within
within

03:14:28.670 --> 03:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
within
 
03:14:30.650 --> 03:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
State Highway right-of-way
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
so the state highway right-of-way would
 
03:14:35.150 --> 03:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
would Trump an override and the prime
 
03:14:37.309 --> 03:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
Wetland designation would not extend
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
into the highway right-of-way I I
 
03:14:43.070 --> 03:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
honestly just speaking for myself for
 
03:14:44.809 --> 03:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
myself I would welcome a clarification
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
because the statute has already did I
 
03:14:48.469 --> 03:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
find confusing personally it could
 
03:14:50.030 --> 03:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
reflect my lack of legislative
 
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
experience here but
 
03:14:54.110 --> 03:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know I could read it both ways you
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
know that we are not allowed to touch
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
wetlands and if we had an easement and
 
03:14:59.630 --> 03:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
now something is designated as a wetland
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
you cannot put it in the Eastman so
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
something that would just clarify the
 
03:15:05.929 --> 03:15:05.939 align:start position:0%
intent of this you know if everybody
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
else on the committee feels with help I
 
03:15:10.490 --> 03:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
would strongly
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
support because I as I said I find the
 
03:15:15.290 --> 03:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
text confusing thank you a clarification
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
of of what our proposed language is is
 
03:15:20.150 --> 03:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
that what you find confusing yes I find
 
03:15:22.870 --> 03:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
the current proposed language in hb2
 
03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
really is hard to understand and it's
 
03:15:27.530 --> 03:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
not clear to me whether it goes one way
 
03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
03:15:32.269 --> 03:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like you to have you describe
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
for me what would this change and how
 
03:15:36.050 --> 03:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
you're doing your work now you know what
 
03:15:38.269 --> 03:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
are you doing now that you can't do or
 
03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
that you would be able to do or
 
03:15:42.889 --> 03:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
um you know can you give an example of
 
03:15:42.899 --> 03:15:44.150 align:start position:0%
um you know can you give an example of
where

03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:15:45.769 --> 03:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
you haven't been able to do what you
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to do and if this passed how
 
03:15:50.750 --> 03:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
would that impact the wetlands does that
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
make sense sure so um for example
 
03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
um if if if if if we have a a ditch line
 
03:16:00.650 --> 03:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
or the outlet of a culvert that is
 
03:16:02.570 --> 03:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
within the that is within the
 
03:16:05.210 --> 03:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
right-of-way and and it leads into a you
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
know bigger outlet and the community has
 
03:16:10.969 --> 03:16:10.979 align:start position:0%
designated that that whole
 
03:16:10.979 --> 03:16:12.050 align:start position:0%
designated that that whole
um

03:16:12.050 --> 03:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
Wetland complex as a prime Wetland then
 
03:16:19.070 --> 03:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
without getting
 
03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:20.510 align:start position:0%
without getting
um

03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:22.969 --> 03:16:22.979 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission approval or
 
03:16:25.309 --> 03:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
wetlander permits or things like that we
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
technically could not maintain the end
 
03:16:30.650 --> 03:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
of that pipe because of the Prime
 
03:16:34.730 --> 03:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.410 --> 03:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
so if you get the
 
03:16:39.170 --> 03:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
the go-ahead from conservation then you
 
03:16:40.450 --> 03:16:40.460 align:start position:0%
could do that
 
03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
isn't there some value to having your
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
work organized so that it does protect
 
03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:51.290 --> 03:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
we would still we would still follow the
 
03:16:54.170 --> 03:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
Wetland the Wetland rules if it is a
 
03:16:55.730 --> 03:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
wetland within the within the state
 
03:16:58.670 --> 03:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
right-of-way it's it's the uh a little
 
03:17:00.050 --> 03:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
bit of the onerousness of the Prime
 
03:17:03.650 --> 03:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
Wetlands designation that that um
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
that that places within the highway
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
right-of-way that can be
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um problematic to us
 
03:17:13.370 --> 03:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
so conservation commissions are not
 
03:17:17.330 --> 03:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
overly friendly on this topic I wouldn't
 
03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
say they're not overly friendly but it's
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's it's it's it's
 
03:17:23.929 --> 03:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
um it's much more processed and much
 
03:17:23.939 --> 03:17:24.950 align:start position:0%
um it's much more processed and much
more

03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:17:24.960 --> 03:17:26.389 align:start position:0%
more
um

03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
um Administration and everything for us
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
to do that routine maintenance sure
 
03:17:34.849 --> 03:17:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:37.910 --> 03:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
so in light of that
 
03:17:41.690 --> 03:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
is this going to drive bad press
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of that we're bypassing the
 
03:17:46.969 --> 03:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
environmental steps that we should be
 
03:17:49.849 --> 03:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
taking are we going to upset people with
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
these actions no I don't believe so
 
03:17:53.330 --> 03:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
because like I said I know we have
 
03:17:55.550 --> 03:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
worked closely with um
 
03:17:57.530 --> 03:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Environmental Services
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
and and others who support this and and
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
recognize the
 
03:18:02.520 --> 03:18:03.670 align:start position:0%
recognize the
um

03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
recognize the um
 
03:18:10.190 --> 03:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
oils of of of the existing Prime Wetland
 
03:18:13.370 --> 03:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
designations and I can get some and and
 
03:18:15.050 --> 03:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know what we have I don't know
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
if we provide at the governor's office
 
03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
but if it would help the committee I can
 
03:18:21.309 --> 03:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
provide a uh in writing a a better
 
03:18:23.690 --> 03:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
explanation with some support from Des
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
as far as what the implications are if
 
03:18:27.950 --> 03:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
it would help you
 
03:18:27.960 --> 03:18:29.389 align:start position:0%
it would help you
okay

03:18:29.389 --> 03:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay so you want to move on the story
 
03:18:33.170 --> 03:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
we'll wait
 
03:18:35.210 --> 03:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
I would suggest waiting just to get the
 
03:18:37.130 --> 03:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
clarification because I think that based
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
on the clarification we require I would
 
03:18:41.450 --> 03:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
still probably ask for a clarification
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the language of the law okay you know
 
03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we really capture the
 
03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:46.910 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we really capture the
intent

03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
intent
 
03:18:49.309 --> 03:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to number
 
03:18:55.920 --> 03:18:57.410 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to number
um

03:18:57.410 --> 03:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
five of ours which is number 126 here
 
03:19:02.769 --> 03:19:02.779 align:start position:0%
which deals with um
 
03:19:04.750 --> 03:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
agreements for telecommission
 
03:19:07.730 --> 03:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
telecommunications related uses of our
 
03:19:10.010 --> 03:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
state highway system and state-owned
 
03:19:12.230 --> 03:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
railroad right-of-way so this is really
 
03:19:15.290 --> 03:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
just a clarification of statutory
 
03:19:18.769 --> 03:19:18.779 align:start position:0%
references the statute applies to both
 
03:19:21.050 --> 03:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
Highway right-of-way and state-owned
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
right of and state-owned railroad rights
 
03:19:26.929 --> 03:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
of way the existing language in in
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
statute only refers to RSA for colon 40
 
03:19:33.769 --> 03:19:33.779 align:start position:0%
which refers to Railroad right-of-way
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
this just provides a clarification to
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
include RSA for 39c which pertains to
 
03:19:44.269 --> 03:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:46.610 --> 03:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee no it's not
 
03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
really a village
 
03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay question sure I remember at
 
03:19:53.809 --> 03:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
one point when they were arguing about
 
03:19:57.050 --> 03:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
the high lines coming down from uh Hydro
 
03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
Quebec and people said well rather than
 
03:20:01.849 --> 03:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
run it that way why don't you run along
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
the highway
 
03:20:05.330 --> 03:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
and someone from the highway department
 
03:20:08.269 --> 03:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
said no you can't use our right-of-way
 
03:20:10.670 --> 03:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
for running power lines is that still in
 
03:20:10.680 --> 03:20:13.550 align:start position:0%
for running power lines is that still in
existence

03:20:13.550 --> 03:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:13.560 --> 03:20:15.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of things that it
 
03:20:20.090 --> 03:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
that had that had happened uh along with
 
03:20:22.010 --> 03:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that did happen
 
03:20:25.550 --> 03:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
legislatively was the designation of of
 
03:20:27.410 --> 03:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
some um
 
03:20:31.130 --> 03:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh utility or infrastructure corridors
 
03:20:31.140 --> 03:20:31.790 align:start position:0%
uh utility or infrastructure corridors
um

03:20:31.790 --> 03:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:34.370 --> 03:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh which included like one-on-one in the
 
03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
interstate highway so that legislation
 
03:20:40.630 --> 03:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
that was passed makes that easier to
 
03:20:44.330 --> 03:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
utilize those corridors for power
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
transmission or other things so it's
 
03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's less restrictive than it used to be
 
03:20:49.849 --> 03:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
it's less restrictive than it used to be
 
03:20:51.710 --> 03:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
I mean one of the one of the
 
03:20:55.610 --> 03:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
restrictions was uh was within the was
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
within the limited access right-of-way
 
03:21:00.230 --> 03:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
of an interstate highway and when they
 
03:21:01.790 --> 03:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
were looking at
 
03:21:01.800 --> 03:21:03.769 align:start position:0%
were looking at
um

03:21:03.769 --> 03:21:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:05.450 --> 03:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
from the power line Transmissions they
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
were looking at State highways where it
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
isn't as restricted and they were
 
03:21:11.809 --> 03:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
looking along like Route 116 and Route 1
 
03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
and Route three uh they were going to
 
03:21:17.269 --> 03:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
bury it is we're going to bury it right
 
03:21:17.279 --> 03:21:18.110 align:start position:0%
bury it is we're going to bury it right
um

03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:19.550 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

03:21:19.550 --> 03:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
but establishing those infrastructure
 
03:21:23.150 --> 03:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
corridors and allowing it within the
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
within the need to stay right of YTM to
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
make a lot more sense for everybody it
 
03:21:28.849 --> 03:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
never came in the northern path you read
 
03:21:30.170 --> 03:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
this as a change and maybe an
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
improvement yes thank you you're welcome
 
03:21:37.849 --> 03:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.010 --> 03:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
all committee members in favor of this
 
03:21:40.020 --> 03:21:41.630 align:start position:0%
all committee members in favor of this
item

03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
item
 
03:21:43.250 --> 03:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
just question can we make sure because
 
03:21:45.889 --> 03:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
on the sheet here we've got 125 126 and
 
03:21:49.070 --> 03:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
127 together and 125 we have questions
 
03:21:52.190 --> 03:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
on but 126 and 27th I think I'm sure
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
Mickey's on top of that
 
03:21:55.849 --> 03:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
but they were lumped together as right
 
03:22:01.550 --> 03:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:01.560 --> 03:22:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:06.840 --> 03:22:13.610 align:start position:0%
 
128.

03:22:13.610 --> 03:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:15.530 --> 03:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
yes you're right I'm sorry I'm with you
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
five and six were were relative to the
 
03:22:20.750 --> 03:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
same thing right or or or 126 is 127
 
03:22:23.809 --> 03:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
were the same so I've got to skip one so
 
03:22:23.819 --> 03:22:25.190 align:start position:0%
were the same so I've got to skip one so
128

03:22:25.190 --> 03:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
128
 
03:22:25.200 --> 03:22:26.210 align:start position:0%
128
um

03:22:26.210 --> 03:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes this um this change just mainly
 
03:22:32.389 --> 03:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
allows us uh enables the payments by
 
03:22:34.849 --> 03:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
credit card uh and to charge a fee for
 
03:22:36.889 --> 03:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
credit card payments
 
03:22:38.210 --> 03:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
um for
 
03:22:38.220 --> 03:22:38.990 align:start position:0%
um for
um

03:22:38.990 --> 03:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
for aircraft registration right now that
 
03:22:43.370 --> 03:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
we don't have the authority to accept
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
payment for aircraft registration by
 
03:22:46.849 --> 03:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
credit cards it's a little outdated so
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it allows us to do that and
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
charge the credit card fee along with it
 
03:22:54.889 --> 03:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
so any questions
 
03:22:57.230 --> 03:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee members in favor
 
03:22:57.240 --> 03:23:07.070 align:start position:0%
committee members in favor
okay

03:23:07.070 --> 03:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
so 129
 
03:23:14.330 --> 03:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
deals with Turnpike system uh toll
 
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
criteria and uh really this seeks to
 
03:23:19.190 --> 03:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
clarify the statute to that provides a
 
03:23:20.690 --> 03:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
discount to New Hampshire tolls for New
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Easy Pass customers
 
03:23:25.729 --> 03:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
um we want to bake this amendment to
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
specify that in order to be eligible for
 
03:23:30.769 --> 03:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
the discounted New Hampshire tolls uh
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
the Easy Pass account holder must be
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
using a funded New Hampshire Easy Pass
 
03:23:37.370 --> 03:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
account and a properly mounted and
 
03:23:40.370 --> 03:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
working transponder when a transponder
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
is not working or is not properly
 
03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
mounted it requires Easy Pass to rely on
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
a plate read and cost us more to collect
 
03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:48.229 align:start position:0%
a plate read and cost us more to collect
um

03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
tolls via plate reads and it's been
 
03:23:52.969 --> 03:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
challenged with some of our things so
 
03:23:54.290 --> 03:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that have like
 
03:23:56.090 --> 03:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
transponders and Easy Pass we call them
 
03:23:58.370 --> 03:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
the Easy Pass wave you know they take it
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
out of the glove box and and wave it
 
03:24:03.110 --> 03:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
under the under the windshield as they
 
03:24:04.969 --> 03:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
go through and it may or may not get a
 
03:24:07.250 --> 03:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
read if it doesn't get a read
 
03:24:10.070 --> 03:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and we have to go to a a toll I mean
 
03:24:12.769 --> 03:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
a license plate read
 
03:24:14.830 --> 03:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
um we don't give them the discount
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
because it costs more to look up the
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
read so this is
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
um you know just clarifying that and
 
03:24:22.729 --> 03:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
statute that it really needs to be
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
properly mounted
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
in order to get the discount questions
 
03:24:29.150 --> 03:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I can attest to that because I got
 
03:24:31.250 --> 03:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
scolded by DMV for having my orange one
 
03:24:34.610 --> 03:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
in the wrong place oh okay
 
03:24:34.620 --> 03:24:35.929 align:start position:0%
in the wrong place oh okay
yes

03:24:35.929 --> 03:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:24:40.190 --> 03:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
I just go to Sim if you will uh
 
03:24:43.370 --> 03:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:46.370 --> 03:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
either either place we depend on both oh
 
03:24:49.250 --> 03:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
you're Dependable thank you
 
03:24:51.170 --> 03:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
there was a bill if you're referring to
 
03:24:52.969 --> 03:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
there was a bill with a friend fun back
 
03:24:55.849 --> 03:24:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh uh we we try to take pictures of both
 
03:24:59.450 --> 03:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
if one's obscured it gives more um
 
03:25:02.750 --> 03:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
it gets it gives more chances of getting
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
a correct read to have both the front
 
03:25:07.070 --> 03:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
and the back so we we do both so that's
 
03:25:08.690 --> 03:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
a real issue here when you're thinking
 
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
about snow and mud that you know
 
03:25:12.650 --> 03:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
certainly your front plate could be
 
03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
obscured for six months of the year
 
03:25:16.610 --> 03:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
possibly so that's so it's a good thing
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
for you to want to have both the front
 
03:25:21.769 --> 03:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
the back in case one is obscured yes
 
03:25:21.779 --> 03:25:23.690 align:start position:0%
the back in case one is obscured yes
exactly

03:25:23.690 --> 03:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
03:25:26.330 --> 03:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this item
 
03:25:29.210 --> 03:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee in favor
 
03:25:29.220 --> 03:25:32.450 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee in favor
okay

03:25:32.450 --> 03:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:35.809 --> 03:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
and the final one with us uh is number
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
130 which deals with the State
 
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation Improvement program
 
03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
um what we're proposing here is to amend
 
03:25:48.349 --> 03:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
RSA 228.99 which which um which governs
 
03:25:50.410 --> 03:25:50.420 align:start position:0%
our step process
 
03:25:53.090 --> 03:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
to Institute and provide a 60-day
 
03:25:55.550 --> 03:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
deadline for Metropolitan planning
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
organizations to review and approve
 
03:26:00.410 --> 03:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
amendments to Transportation Improvement
 
03:26:03.290 --> 03:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
plans this deadline will help us realize
 
03:26:05.450 --> 03:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
other timelines set by state and federal
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
law to achieve more timely and
 
03:26:09.309 --> 03:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
consistent planning results
 
03:26:13.490 --> 03:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
what we find with our step amendments we
 
03:26:15.530 --> 03:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
deal with several when when we're up
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
there in the step is our
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
governing document for
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
um you know construction projects and
 
03:26:23.929 --> 03:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
stuff that are that are in their
 
03:26:26.450 --> 03:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
construction project has to be funded in
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
a in a in a approved step to be eligible
 
03:26:31.790 --> 03:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
for federal funds
 
03:26:31.800 --> 03:26:32.510 align:start position:0%
for federal funds
um

03:26:32.510 --> 03:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:36.410 --> 03:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's very Dynamic we're always updating
 
03:26:39.650 --> 03:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
keeping it current to the current costs
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
um we found it very challenging without
 
03:26:47.090 --> 03:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
a uh harder deadline uh dealing with the
 
03:26:49.130 --> 03:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
the different mpos and trying to get
 
03:26:51.110 --> 03:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
this done in a timely fashion so this is
 
03:26:55.849 --> 03:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
our our this is our our intent uh here
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
is is to um
 
03:27:00.650 --> 03:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
get a more efficient
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
um stiff amendment process so that we
 
03:27:05.929 --> 03:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:05.939 --> 03:27:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
great

03:27:07.490 --> 03:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:27:10.190 --> 03:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:27:12.889 --> 03:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
all in favor of this item
 
03:27:12.899 --> 03:27:15.950 align:start position:0%
all in favor of this item
okay

03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:18.290 --> 03:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
I have a question in general by all
 
03:27:20.929 --> 03:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
means I'm sure you'd love that general
 
03:27:23.450 --> 03:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
question certainly yeah probably right
 
03:27:25.969 --> 03:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
right on the tip of his tongue we saw a
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
piece where we were putting more money
 
03:27:29.090 --> 03:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
into the uh
 
03:27:33.290 --> 03:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
the state apart a you know distributed
 
03:27:35.570 --> 03:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
to the towns and cities and because of
 
03:27:39.050 --> 03:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
the revenue supposedly was up
 
03:27:41.030 --> 03:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
the one we had reported from Ways and
 
03:27:42.530 --> 03:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
Means was up over what the governor
 
03:27:44.510 --> 03:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
thought which is highly unusual usually
 
03:27:46.670 --> 03:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimates are above what
 
03:27:49.790 --> 03:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
ways and means are so year over year how
 
03:27:52.910 --> 03:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
is the highway fund doing in the in
 
03:27:52.920 --> 03:27:55.490 align:start position:0%
is the highway fund doing in the in
collections

03:27:55.490 --> 03:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
collections
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak to collections
 
03:27:59.929 --> 03:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
department of safety is in charge of its
 
03:28:01.370 --> 03:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
collections so they can talk about the
 
03:28:03.290 --> 03:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates and stuff but with but
 
03:28:05.870 --> 03:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
relative to the um if you're talking to
 
03:28:09.650 --> 03:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
was it SB 270 270 those are just about
 
03:28:14.090 --> 03:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
about that there is presently a um I
 
03:28:16.070 --> 03:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
think at the end of uh part of the Kappa
 
03:28:18.290 --> 03:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
there was 111 million dollar Surplus
 
03:28:20.690 --> 03:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
Highway fund Surplus part with that was
 
03:28:22.010 --> 03:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
due to
 
03:28:24.650 --> 03:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
um a 50 million dollar infusion of of
 
03:28:26.809 --> 03:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
General funds into the highway fund that
 
03:28:28.070 --> 03:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
would took place
 
03:28:30.290 --> 03:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
um by the Senate at the end of the last
 
03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh session and that was done in in
 
03:28:34.969 --> 03:28:34.979 align:start position:0%
reflection of the structural deficit of
 
03:28:38.630 --> 03:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
the highway fund um right right now and
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at it without just
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
looking at Mickey here beforehand that
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of this biennium that
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
present balance in the highway fund gets
 
03:28:48.290 --> 03:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
spent down to
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
um you know close to I think 13 million
 
03:28:52.969 --> 03:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
dollars so and we hope that there is a
 
03:28:54.410 --> 03:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
structural deficit essentially
 
03:28:56.570 --> 03:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
expenditures and Appropriations from the
 
03:28:59.510 --> 03:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
highway fund out outstrip
 
03:29:02.330 --> 03:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
revenues revenues coming in
 
03:29:05.570 --> 03:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
roughly by about 28 to 30 million
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
dollars uh annually so you know that
 
03:29:11.809 --> 03:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
current balance because of what the
 
03:29:12.889 --> 03:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
Senate did at the end of the last
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
session is intended to at least carry
 
03:29:17.330 --> 03:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
through this biennium
 
03:29:21.290 --> 03:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:24.410 --> 03:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions for committee
 
03:29:26.269 --> 03:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming okay well thank you
 
03:29:27.769 --> 03:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
for having us sure it's a pleasure
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
thanks so we just got one follow-up on
 
03:29:32.990 --> 03:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
that yes I'll get that information and
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'll get it um to you Mr chair okay get
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
it to Mickey perfect
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:49.370 --> 03:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
you're gonna be seeing a another fiscal
 
03:29:52.010 --> 03:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
item in the next physical meeting we
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
just rushed one through as we got
 
03:29:55.729 --> 03:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
through last week and crunched all the
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
numbers on on on Monday of where we
 
03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
stand with uh things
 
03:30:00.960 --> 03:30:02.530 align:start position:0%
stand with uh things
yeah

03:30:02.530 --> 03:30:02.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:30:04.729 --> 03:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
right right
 
03:30:06.530 --> 03:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's probably about average to passes
 
03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
this has been a very average winter it's
 
03:30:11.450 --> 03:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
kind of come late but it's but it's
 
03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:29.450 --> 03:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:32.690 --> 03:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
and no I mean we have and I I don't want
 
03:30:34.670 --> 03:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
to take your time we can come I can come
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:40.190 --> 03:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:30:43.250 --> 03:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
I probably said that we we are we are
 
03:30:47.469 --> 03:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
staffed for summer summer maintenance
 
03:30:50.929 --> 03:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
we've always relied on higher I Applause
 
03:30:53.330 --> 03:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
to other states
 
03:30:53.340 --> 03:30:56.570 align:start position:0%
to other states
um

03:30:56.570 --> 03:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
live laptop and staff
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
with the maintenance
 
03:31:05.809 --> 03:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
so uh we traditionally have not
 
03:31:08.990 --> 03:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
staff but the forward domain relied on
 
03:31:11.450 --> 03:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
the I I
 
03:31:15.769 --> 03:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates this year by more heavily
 
03:31:18.290 --> 03:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
on the market Cloud so that's open up
 
03:31:20.110 --> 03:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
the bank but I wouldn't
 
03:31:24.110 --> 03:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:37.729 --> 03:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:39.830 --> 03:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
now they've said that
 
03:31:44.330 --> 03:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.090 --> 03:36:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
minimums but it's a lot of money coming
 
03:36:12.050 --> 03:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
into school district and it's to help
 
03:36:14.450 --> 03:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
kids participated and then all our other
 
03:36:17.330 --> 03:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
clients are equally based on these
 
03:36:18.849 --> 03:36:18.859 align:start position:0%
formulas they come out of Washington
 
03:36:22.490 --> 03:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
based on that data so it means a lot
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:55.490 --> 03:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.769 --> 03:36:57.779 align:start position:0%
no no no no
 
03:37:01.969 --> 03:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
that's the the current values are for a
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
family of four it's uh 27 750 in 2022
 
03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
income numbers that's why we apply the
 
03:37:11.530 --> 03:37:11.540 align:start position:0%
multipliers and we say 200 or
 
03:37:11.540 --> 03:37:13.090 align:start position:0%
multipliers and we say 200 or
27

03:37:13.090 --> 03:37:13.100 align:start position:0%
27
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:20.210 --> 03:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
well that multiplied by 5 would be about
 
03:37:23.929 --> 03:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
135. for a family of four
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
right and for a family for individual is
 
03:37:31.309 --> 03:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
13.6 and for a family of uh eighties
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:52.370 --> 03:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:52.380 --> 03:37:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
so the ones that we have right now it's
 
03:38:05.450 --> 03:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
taken 300. so for new peoples for me no
 
03:38:05.460 --> 03:38:07.550 align:start position:0%
taken 300. so for new peoples for me no
it's

03:38:07.550 --> 03:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:38:07.560 --> 03:38:21.530 align:start position:0%
it's
it's

03:38:21.530 --> 03:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that basically they
 
03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
are looking to relax those income caps
 
03:38:27.710 --> 03:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
for certain groups that are deemed to be
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know more decent right but you know
 
03:39:16.130 --> 03:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:16.140 --> 03:39:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
there's

03:39:31.610 --> 03:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:31.620 --> 03:39:40.570 align:start position:0%
 
pictures

03:39:40.570 --> 03:39:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:21.050 --> 03:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah right yes so on on the busy
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
schedule the spreadsheet it's on the
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
second page so row 64. under the
 
03:40:40.010 --> 03:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:40.020 --> 03:40:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
s

03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.490 --> 03:40:48.500 align:start position:0%
among the students
 
03:40:51.410 --> 03:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
and so it's kind of
 
03:40:53.090 --> 03:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:40:56.450 --> 03:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
a special class kids come to uh it
 
03:40:58.250 --> 03:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
worked really well I thought the number
 
03:40:59.389 --> 03:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
of kids
 
03:40:59.399 --> 03:41:00.769 align:start position:0%
of kids
um

03:41:00.769 --> 03:41:00.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
get good results and it actually
 
03:41:03.239 --> 03:41:11.229 align:start position:0%
get good results and it actually
originated

03:41:11.229 --> 03:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.530 --> 03:41:14.540 align:start position:0%
and this was one of the
 
03:41:18.050 --> 03:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
ways that they identified as possibly a
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
source of building kids skills and a lot
 
03:41:25.849 --> 03:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
of it is that it is attrition time for a
 
03:41:41.690 --> 03:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.750 --> 03:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:53.570 --> 03:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
I mean you know realistically I mean we
 
03:41:55.130 --> 03:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about this for a long
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
remedial in the cause of levels for a
 
03:42:11.229 --> 03:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.030 --> 03:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
practical applications like the kids
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.960 --> 03:42:37.429 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:37.439 --> 03:42:58.429 align:start position:0%
 
Gladys

03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.439 --> 03:43:00.530 align:start position:0%
 
insurance

03:43:00.530 --> 03:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.710 --> 03:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's 200 000 I mean it's in our budget
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:20.809 --> 03:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
initiator is definitely
 
03:43:28.010 --> 03:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of money we have to express is
 
03:43:28.020 --> 03:43:29.150 align:start position:0%
a lot of money we have to express is
just

03:43:29.150 --> 03:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:43:29.160 --> 03:43:30.710 align:start position:0%
just
amazing

03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:35.450 align:start position:0%
amazing
um

03:43:35.450 --> 03:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.239 --> 03:43:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
them

03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:51.790 --> 03:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.650 --> 03:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
well I mean you know it does but you
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
know you got so much money
 
03:43:59.150 --> 03:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
you know you got your shopping list
 
03:44:01.190 --> 03:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
90 million dollars you got to make it up
 
03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:09.469 align:start position:0%
90 million dollars you got to make it up
somehow

03:44:09.469 --> 03:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:09.479 --> 03:44:10.450 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:44:10.450 --> 03:44:10.460 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:44:19.269 --> 03:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:21.410 --> 03:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
not spending
 
03:44:32.889 --> 03:44:32.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's way too much money
 
03:44:39.889 --> 03:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars a student
 
03:44:43.729 --> 03:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
what are they spending parochial schools
 
03:44:43.739 --> 03:44:45.290 align:start position:0%
what are they spending parochial schools
after

03:44:45.290 --> 03:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:44:45.300 --> 03:44:47.830 align:start position:0%
after
easily

03:44:47.830 --> 03:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
easily
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
and if they close what happens
 
03:45:15.070 --> 03:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:15.080 --> 03:45:16.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:45:16.610 --> 03:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:45:21.250 --> 03:45:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:24.729 --> 03:45:24.739 align:start position:0%
that I've known for years
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
I remember visiting one where they said
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
those three students and IEPs for
 
03:45:52.910 --> 03:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
emotional upset
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
they came to our school they were no
 
03:45:58.610 --> 03:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
longer emotionally upset
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
I saved a lot of money
 
03:46:04.150 --> 03:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:06.349 --> 03:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
remember I was at the department of
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
Edward we developed charts
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
Middle School I remember that favorite
 
03:46:12.769 --> 03:46:12.779 align:start position:0%
school it took me 10 years to pass
 
03:46:14.690 --> 03:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
church and
 
03:46:16.969 --> 03:46:16.979 align:start position:0%
I was with
 
03:46:21.370 --> 03:46:21.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:26.469 --> 03:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
and it's fabulous and it's made a
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
difference to all people false teachers
 
03:46:35.710 --> 03:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
I remember his name
 
03:46:46.429 --> 03:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:46.439 --> 03:47:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:47:31.269 --> 03:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:33.889 --> 03:47:33.899 align:start position:0%
dealing with the associates degree
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
to dual enrollment
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
through the U.S
 
03:47:38.640 --> 03:47:40.809 align:start position:0%
through the U.S
um

03:47:40.809 --> 03:47:40.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:43.809 --> 03:47:43.819 align:start position:0%
all kinds of Hands-On
 
03:47:46.370 --> 03:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
forces that they've developed with
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum is our new development
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
teachers they know but they have over
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
he said
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.040 --> 03:48:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
each

03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.720 --> 03:48:12.110 align:start position:0%
 
individually

03:48:12.110 --> 03:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.290 --> 03:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
it's a model of the United States and
 
03:48:19.370 --> 03:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
what it's done is every single one of
 
03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
the students at Temple High School she
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
was Barbara from Watkins in Paris
 
03:48:27.050 --> 03:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
and she couldn't continue to go to high
 
03:48:29.570 --> 03:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
school so she signed up with ux and she
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
graduated the same doctorate class so we
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
ought to put more money and relax and
 
03:48:33.359 --> 03:48:39.110 align:start position:0%
ought to put more money and relax and
Russian

03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:51.769 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:48:51.769 --> 03:48:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:54.910 --> 03:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
ten thousand how about
 
03:48:58.130 --> 03:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
how many students no no about about what
 
03:49:00.729 --> 03:49:00.739 align:start position:0%
what they what we spend for relaxing
 
03:49:07.010 --> 03:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.410 --> 03:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:19.729 --> 03:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
as well and so you're getting about one
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
course fraction so that's what the state
 
03:49:24.530 --> 03:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
reimburses how much how much load can
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
they get
 
03:49:28.269 --> 03:49:28.279 align:start position:0%
and they take six courses uh
 
03:49:31.729 --> 03:49:31.739 align:start position:0%
more teachers no no but I mean what what
 
03:49:37.250 --> 03:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:39.790 --> 03:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
as many as they can because
 
03:49:43.190 --> 03:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
they have staff that works with the
 
03:49:45.710 --> 03:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
students so that if they're taking too
 
03:49:47.809 --> 03:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
many of them
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
um just like in regular store with kids
 
03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
off on me likes don't always compete
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you have to be a certain kind of kid
 
03:49:58.849 --> 03:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
that's really self-directed to really do
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
well and some kids build and some things
 
03:50:05.090 --> 03:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
um you know it's new I think it couldn't
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
college kids it wouldn't stand being
 
03:50:07.080 --> 03:50:08.389 align:start position:0%
college kids it wouldn't stand being
online

03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
online
 
03:50:10.849 --> 03:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
what I love is like a virtual
 
03:50:15.010 --> 03:50:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.050 --> 03:50:20.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.889 --> 03:50:21.899 align:start position:0%
but they didn't have different
 
03:50:21.899 --> 03:50:23.769 align:start position:0%
but they didn't have different
assignments

03:50:23.769 --> 03:50:23.779 align:start position:0%
assignments
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:50:34.610 --> 03:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
it was interesting you didn't have all
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
the reagencies don't give a chemistry
 
03:50:41.330 --> 03:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
what do you call witness tests
 
03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:57.359 --> 03:51:12.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:12.130 --> 03:51:12.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:16.729 --> 03:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:43.370 --> 03:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.929 --> 03:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.939 --> 03:53:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:20.650 --> 03:53:20.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.210 --> 03:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
well we can go ahead and start the work
 
03:53:40.620 --> 03:53:41.929 align:start position:0%
well we can go ahead and start the work
session

03:53:41.929 --> 03:53:41.939 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:53:44.570 --> 03:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh welcome
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
and you've obviously got it all written
 
03:53:49.010 --> 03:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
out already so
 
03:53:50.630 --> 03:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's your show
 
03:53:53.150 --> 03:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
we'll just eat we're going to consider
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
each item as you present it okay very
 
03:53:57.170 --> 03:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
good thank you um
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Steve Lavoy director
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
of administration for the Department of
 
03:54:00.359 --> 03:54:01.610 align:start position:0%
of administration for the Department of
Safety

03:54:01.610 --> 03:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
03:54:04.490 --> 03:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
um with me as commissioner Quinn good
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon Robert Coyne commissioner
 
03:54:07.729 --> 03:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
Department safety store so the items
 
03:54:09.769 --> 03:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
that are listed here in order from
 
03:54:11.929 --> 03:54:11.939 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill 2 so they're in the exact
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
order of the bill first is the body worn
 
03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
and dashboard camera fund and this is an
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
item that appropriates an additional
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars one one million five
 
03:54:23.689 --> 03:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in Appropriations
 
03:54:28.130 --> 03:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
um two fund grants to locals which are
 
03:54:30.469 --> 03:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
to encourage them to adopt body camera
 
03:54:32.990 --> 03:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
and Cruiser cameras in their police
 
03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:34.389 align:start position:0%
and Cruiser cameras in their police
departments

03:54:34.389 --> 03:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
departments
 
03:54:38.450 --> 03:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
and these grants will cover costs up to
 
03:54:41.450 --> 03:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
50 percent up to fifty thousand dollars
 
03:54:44.090 --> 03:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
per entity and that program was designed
 
03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
with those restraints to ensure that
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
both small and large
 
03:54:50.929 --> 03:54:50.939 align:start position:0%
departments had an opportunity to
 
03:54:50.939 --> 03:54:53.570 align:start position:0%
departments had an opportunity to
participate

03:54:53.570 --> 03:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:57.410 --> 03:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
to date we have funded
 
03:55:00.050 --> 03:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
I believe it was 48
 
03:55:02.929 --> 03:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
communities over over a million dollars
 
03:55:05.450 --> 03:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
in in funding and so there's definitely
 
03:55:07.370 --> 03:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
a demand out there for these types of
 
03:55:09.889 --> 03:55:09.899 align:start position:0%
this type of financial support and this
 
03:55:11.809 --> 03:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
is a small way that the state is able to
 
03:55:14.689 --> 03:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
help encourage this adoption
 
03:55:21.969 --> 03:55:21.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.610 --> 03:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
looking I was looking at this page which
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
started with
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
the police force cap and I'm trying to
 
03:55:33.889 --> 03:55:33.899 align:start position:0%
find an hb2 the reference to
 
03:55:37.010 --> 03:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
um the cameras which I'm
 
03:55:41.450 --> 03:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's on page 32 of the bill
 
03:55:44.150 --> 03:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
and it's like um
 
03:55:49.550 --> 03:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:00.050 --> 03:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
Heather Thomas yes
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
so it's just one year so I it's not
 
03:56:07.010 --> 03:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
elapsing right
 
03:56:09.050 --> 03:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
correct yes it's a it's a non-lapsing
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated fund which
 
03:56:13.250 --> 03:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
allows us to continue to offer those
 
03:56:15.290 --> 03:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
grants until the money uh is drawn down
 
03:56:17.689 --> 03:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
and it seems like it's really working
 
03:56:20.090 --> 03:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
well everywhere I know in Manchester our
 
03:56:22.250 --> 03:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
guys are using them
 
03:56:24.590 --> 03:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
um they seem to like them I think it's
 
03:56:26.889 --> 03:56:26.899 align:start position:0%
accountability for everybody
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:41.689 --> 03:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
and this just provides more
 
03:56:43.969 --> 03:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
opportunities for others that might not
 
03:56:43.979 --> 03:56:46.370 align:start position:0%
opportunities for others that might not
happen

03:56:46.370 --> 03:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.380 --> 03:56:47.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:56:47.450 --> 03:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:56:49.250 --> 03:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee in favor of
 
03:56:52.849 --> 03:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
all right the next item
 
03:56:58.199 --> 03:56:59.570 align:start position:0%
all right the next item
um

03:56:59.570 --> 03:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
it does two things one it establishes a
 
03:57:03.769 --> 03:57:03.779 align:start position:0%
new grants program and then it also
 
03:57:05.990 --> 03:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
provides the Appropriations to to fund
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
that and that's the northern border
 
03:57:09.410 --> 03:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
Alliance program
 
03:57:09.420 --> 03:57:10.250 align:start position:0%
Alliance program
um

03:57:10.250 --> 03:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:13.729 --> 03:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
that's the language that's on page 34.
 
03:57:13.739 --> 03:57:15.769 align:start position:0%
that's the language that's on page 34.
uh

03:57:15.769 --> 03:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:57:19.250 --> 03:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
item number 93.
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
and so this program would make grants
 
03:57:23.150 --> 03:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
available to State County and local law
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies and also fund
 
03:57:28.910 --> 03:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
um overtime patrols at State Police to
 
03:57:30.290 --> 03:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
reduce the instance of crimes and
 
03:57:32.090 --> 03:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
illicit activity and proximity to the
 
03:57:33.370 --> 03:57:33.380 align:start position:0%
Canadian border
 
03:57:36.530 --> 03:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
specifically within a 25-mile radius is
 
03:57:40.490 --> 03:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
what has been identified there's 619
 
03:57:42.349 --> 03:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars appropriated for New
 
03:57:45.170 --> 03:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police and 815 000
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
appropriated to local County Partners in
 
03:57:51.769 --> 03:57:51.779 align:start position:0%
that area it's modeled after an existing
 
03:57:53.929 --> 03:57:53.939 align:start position:0%
federally funded grant program called
 
03:57:55.870 --> 03:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
operation stone garden
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
the funding for that particular program
 
03:58:01.130 --> 03:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
has has been reduced over the last
 
03:58:03.410 --> 03:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
several years it was about 300 000 per
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
year over the last two Grant Cycles it
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
was reduced to a hundred and eighty
 
03:58:10.010 --> 03:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year and there has
 
03:58:12.650 --> 03:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
been increased activity in illegal
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
Crossings and so this is one way that we
 
03:58:18.170 --> 03:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
can ensure that state laws aren't being
 
03:58:20.510 --> 03:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
broken along along the Border
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
I think you had a question on this part
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
two do we have a problem with the Border
 
03:58:28.849 --> 03:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
so I will tell you um
 
03:58:28.859 --> 03:58:30.290 align:start position:0%
so I will tell you um
there

03:58:30.290 --> 03:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:58:34.010 --> 03:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
we have 58 miles of border
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
we fall between the Swanton and the
 
03:58:39.889 --> 03:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
Holton section of the border patrol
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
um we are following activity uh through
 
03:58:44.809 --> 03:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire Intelligence and
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
Analysis Center there's open source
 
03:58:48.889 --> 03:58:48.899 align:start position:0%
information but you what you will see is
 
03:58:52.370 --> 03:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
in a full month period what what was
 
03:58:54.290 --> 03:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
reported recently was I want to say
 
03:58:58.910 --> 03:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
almost an 850 percent increase in
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
apprehensions of illegals in that
 
03:59:04.670 --> 03:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
northern border area so recently I
 
03:59:06.290 --> 03:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
believe it was an AP article that
 
03:59:09.050 --> 03:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
indicated that the border patrol has
 
03:59:12.830 --> 03:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
increased with 25 additional agents to
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
the northern Board of that area so I
 
03:59:16.429 --> 03:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
think what we're trying to do is be
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
proactive and ensure that we have the um
 
03:59:21.729 --> 03:59:21.739 align:start position:0%
the program and the collaborative
 
03:59:24.469 --> 03:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
resources needed to to protect the
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
border so you've got
 
03:59:28.849 --> 03:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
um just loving that part of New
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think about I'm not going to
 
03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
say the the lake oh my friend my GOG
 
03:59:37.250 --> 03:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
that one
 
03:59:41.389 --> 03:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
um that that's in Canada and New
 
03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or Vermont actually
 
03:59:46.070 --> 03:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a lot of
 
03:59:46.080 --> 03:59:46.849 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a lot of
um

03:59:46.849 --> 03:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:50.090 --> 03:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trails how do you how can you
 
03:59:53.870 --> 03:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
cover all that how will those offices do
 
03:59:56.330 --> 03:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
that it isn't just border control it's
 
03:59:57.889 --> 03:59:57.899 align:start position:0%
it's people coming through different
 
04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
areas sure so that's a great question
 
04:00:01.969 --> 04:00:01.979 align:start position:0%
and um what I learned recently is the
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
majority of that land is uh State Forest
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
when yes um so that's that's essentially
 
04:00:09.530 --> 04:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
why this program was developed 10 years
 
04:00:12.830 --> 04:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
ago so to do that what you need is a
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
plan so you need a plan built on enough
 
04:00:18.830 --> 04:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
resources state and federal the state
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
and local offices can enforce local
 
04:00:24.410 --> 04:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
state law the federal Offices can
 
04:00:26.450 --> 04:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
enforce federal law but they have a
 
04:00:29.150 --> 04:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
coordinated plan built on obviously
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
intelligence and so getting all the
 
04:00:33.349 --> 04:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
federal Partners to work with the state
 
04:00:35.750 --> 04:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
local that's how you do that through
 
04:00:39.769 --> 04:00:39.779 align:start position:0%
land maybe sometimes air but but there's
 
04:00:42.849 --> 04:00:42.859 align:start position:0%
uh it's a lot of work though
 
04:00:47.090 --> 04:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
so a question I have is how will we
 
04:00:47.100 --> 04:00:49.090 align:start position:0%
so a question I have is how will we
prevent

04:00:49.090 --> 04:00:49.100 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
incidental stopping of individuals let's
 
04:00:52.199 --> 04:00:53.389 align:start position:0%
incidental stopping of individuals let's
say

04:00:53.389 --> 04:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure someone
 
04:01:03.170 --> 04:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't get stopped just because they
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't look like everybody else in the
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
North Country sure sure no that's a
 
04:01:08.809 --> 04:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
great question so I think it's important
 
04:01:11.450 --> 04:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
to note that even um the state police we
 
04:01:13.130 --> 04:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
have what's called a fair and impartial
 
04:01:16.490 --> 04:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
policing policy which um is very clear
 
04:01:16.500 --> 04:01:17.710 align:start position:0%
policing policy which um is very clear
on

04:01:17.710 --> 04:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
some of the areas that we want to
 
04:01:22.849 --> 04:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
prevent there's a a carve out in there
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
that says what they can and can't do but
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
specifically to the border so you know
 
04:01:31.969 --> 04:01:31.979 align:start position:0%
with you know car stops away from this
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
area they have to adhere to the fair and
 
04:01:36.769 --> 04:01:36.779 align:start position:0%
impartial policing policy but what we're
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
talking about here specifically is is
 
04:01:43.130 --> 04:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
the Border in areas of of Ingress in
 
04:01:45.410 --> 04:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
that area so the the New Hampshire State
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
Police will be very very cognizant to
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
adhere to their policy all right thank
 
04:01:49.319 --> 04:01:49.969 align:start position:0%
adhere to their policy all right thank
you

04:01:49.969 --> 04:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:01:49.979 --> 04:01:51.050 align:start position:0%
you
yeah

04:01:51.050 --> 04:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:01:53.150 --> 04:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:01:55.070 --> 04:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
04:01:57.229 --> 04:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to understand because I'm
 
04:01:59.570 --> 04:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
already aware of the uh you know lovable
 
04:02:01.969 --> 04:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
100 mile border Zone under the federal
 
04:02:05.210 --> 04:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
regulations that essentially allows CBP
 
04:02:06.889 --> 04:02:06.899 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
treat this area as if constitutional
 
04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
rights don't really apply in the name of
 
04:02:13.849 --> 04:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
securing the borders I'm genuinely
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if when we already
 
04:02:19.010 --> 04:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
have an overreaching federal statute why
 
04:02:20.929 --> 04:02:20.939 align:start position:0%
do we need to Grant even further
 
04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
authority to our you know State you know
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to operate within a 25
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
you know mile border I'm not concerned
 
04:02:31.729 --> 04:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
about the Appropriations I agree that
 
04:02:33.710 --> 04:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
you have a job you know you have to be
 
04:02:35.450 --> 04:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
given the resources I'm fine with the
 
04:02:37.969 --> 04:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
program my question is specifically on
 
04:02:37.979 --> 04:02:39.050 align:start position:0%
program my question is specifically on
the

04:02:39.050 --> 04:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
in additional Authority granted under
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
here which I'm trying to understand why
 
04:02:46.370 --> 04:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's needed giving that again the CBP
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
already has you know the Customs and
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
Border Patrol already has a massive
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
amount of authority which I find
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
excessive in every every way so why do
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
we now need to add to that right so that
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and again I
 
04:03:03.410 --> 04:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
think this is very limited
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
um in the scope of what the state
 
04:03:08.330 --> 04:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
troopers would be added and again its
 
04:03:10.969 --> 04:03:10.979 align:start position:0%
majority is a state forest but there are
 
04:03:10.979 --> 04:03:12.410 align:start position:0%
majority is a state forest but there are
specific

04:03:12.410 --> 04:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:03:14.590 --> 04:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
um authority to those
 
04:03:19.250 --> 04:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
dncr officers and we're just in the
 
04:03:22.570 --> 04:03:22.580 align:start position:0%
event that a State Trooper comes across
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
and they don't have the border patrol
 
04:03:26.929 --> 04:03:26.939 align:start position:0%
agent with them and what's happened in
 
04:03:29.330 --> 04:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
the past is you know these details were
 
04:03:31.610 --> 04:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
really developed the program was to have
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
a partnership So what had happened in
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
years past was the border patrol agents
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
were shifted away from there and unable
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
to to go in partnership with the state
 
04:03:43.849 --> 04:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
troopers all the fish and game officers
 
04:03:47.330 --> 04:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
are the dncr are the Colebrook offices
 
04:03:49.729 --> 04:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing with this is more to
 
04:03:53.150 --> 04:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
I would just say make sure we minimize
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
any liability and that if they have to
 
04:03:57.889 --> 04:03:57.899 align:start position:0%
take action and they're alone they have
 
04:03:59.809 --> 04:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
the same Authority that the force and
 
04:04:01.849 --> 04:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
land do in the event of somebody that
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
crosses over in those I appreciate the
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
explanation honestly you know I would
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate if the committee would
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
consider discussing the Appropriations
 
04:04:12.469 --> 04:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
and the legislation separately because
 
04:04:14.210 --> 04:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
my vote will be different on the two
 
04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
topics you know so uh either way
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:04:22.250 --> 04:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you do we have one Border
 
04:04:24.429 --> 04:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
Crossing in New Hampshire up at the
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes
 
04:04:29.210 --> 04:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
or how many border crossings do we have
 
04:04:31.610 --> 04:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
we have the poor the the animals in
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh and that's from eight
 
04:04:37.389 --> 04:04:37.399 align:start position:0%
a to 8p right
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
and this is pertaining to
 
04:04:44.150 --> 04:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
um the work you do on the highway on
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
roads no so is this because I'm what I'm
 
04:04:48.530 --> 04:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
asking is there any problem with people
 
04:04:50.330 --> 04:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
there'd be nuts to try to cross through
 
04:04:52.490 --> 04:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
that forest and if you got across you
 
04:04:54.410 --> 04:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be anywhere in Canada you'd be
 
04:04:56.210 --> 04:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
miles from you'd be at least 12 miles
 
04:04:57.889 --> 04:04:57.899 align:start position:0%
from a house
 
04:05:00.410 --> 04:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
well and I think ma'am if um if you look
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
at what's happening in that area that's
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
exactly what is happening with those
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
Crossings and what we're trying to just
 
04:05:08.809 --> 04:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
stay proactive on but there's two issues
 
04:05:11.210 --> 04:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
here like um director of The Voice said
 
04:05:13.790 --> 04:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
we are in close proximity to that border
 
04:05:15.769 --> 04:05:15.779 align:start position:0%
but there's really you know we know
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's some roads you know we've got
 
04:05:20.570 --> 04:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
Route 3 we've got other areas so this
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
this program is focused on the border
 
04:05:25.849 --> 04:05:25.859 align:start position:0%
but there can be you know going out in
 
04:05:27.650 --> 04:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
the out in the rural areas on the
 
04:05:30.290 --> 04:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
off-road vehicles but again it's all
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
driven by you know what do we have for
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
intelligence working with our federal
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
partners and expanding this to make sure
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
we uh we understand why what might be
 
04:05:40.969 --> 04:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
happening you know where we should be
 
04:05:43.429 --> 04:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
where we should be focusing but again
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's 58 miles of border and um if
 
04:05:49.309 --> 04:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
anything is you know on the roads it's
 
04:05:52.130 --> 04:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
in that general area or it's focused
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
narrowly on the border
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
sure great thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:05:59.809 --> 04:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here
 
04:05:59.819 --> 04:06:00.889 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here
um

04:06:00.889 --> 04:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:03.530 --> 04:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
on that same border crossing okay you
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
said it was open from a certain time to
 
04:06:08.090 --> 04:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
a certain time and if you come up is it
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
still open in other words if you let's
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
say you come after after hours I believe
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
the gates just closed oh the gaseous
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
closed because I know in the past you
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
could just drive across and then you had
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
to report say the beach of Falls and you
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
know I think the number is open source
 
04:06:24.650 --> 04:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
last year don't don't hold me to this
 
04:06:26.929 --> 04:06:26.939 align:start position:0%
but I I believe I read there was like 7
 
04:06:29.330 --> 04:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
500 passenger vehicle vehicles that went
 
04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
through and 1500 commercials so that's a
 
04:06:34.370 --> 04:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
year that was yeah that was in a year
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's cool the other thing I wanted to
 
04:06:39.410 --> 04:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
to make note of is the pro the one of
 
04:06:42.170 --> 04:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
the main reasons behind this the stone
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
garden program that director Lavoy
 
04:06:47.150 --> 04:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
really spoke of which was built and
 
04:06:48.769 --> 04:06:48.779 align:start position:0%
established which was trying to enhance
 
04:06:48.779 --> 04:06:49.550 align:start position:0%
established which was trying to enhance
it

04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:06:51.410 --> 04:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
um we have limited funds
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
so we have limited Appropriations to
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
continue to to really pay attention to
 
04:07:00.290 --> 04:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
what we believe is going to be an issue
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
and have the funds available with this
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have enough Law
 
04:07:06.530 --> 04:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers out there we know
 
04:07:08.330 --> 04:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
what will be coordinated we've got
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
strong Partnerships with with uh with
 
04:07:13.130 --> 04:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
the Border Patrol and um so it's going
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
to be important for us to have the funds
 
04:07:17.570 --> 04:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
necessary to put these uh these folks
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
strategically out there to to secure
 
04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
yeah don't follow well I I do have
 
04:07:28.729 --> 04:07:28.739 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh I know I've talked to
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
officer uh state state police up there
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
and it's a very big area to cover and
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't have very many people to do
 
04:07:38.330 --> 04:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
it I I we don't want to get into numbers
 
04:07:40.969 --> 04:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
because that's that's something else but
 
04:07:43.490 --> 04:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
I know that uh in the past it's been a
 
04:07:43.500 --> 04:07:44.330 align:start position:0%
I know that uh in the past it's been a
tough

04:07:44.330 --> 04:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
tough
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
tough to enforce yeah any any law
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement yeah and and our our you
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
know the colonel the state police The
 
04:07:54.889 --> 04:07:54.899 align:start position:0%
Troop commander of the troop F area
 
04:07:57.170 --> 04:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
um if these funds are given we will you
 
04:07:58.969 --> 04:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
know we will establish a good program
 
04:08:01.610 --> 04:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
built upon stone garden I know we'll
 
04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
have uh uh have a lot of participation
 
04:08:07.130 --> 04:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of good Folks up there
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
on Fish and Game and dncr and the local
 
04:08:11.210 --> 04:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
police departments that will work
 
04:08:13.309 --> 04:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
together and I think we will enhance and
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
and be out there and do our best to be
 
04:08:18.050 --> 04:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
proactive it I I do think it is
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
something that um that we we have to
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
focus on if you just look at the data if
 
04:08:25.370 --> 04:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
you look at what's happening in close
 
04:08:25.380 --> 04:08:27.050 align:start position:0%
you look at what's happening in close
proximity

04:08:27.050 --> 04:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
proximity
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
um it says that we need to be you know
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
forward-leaning as it may shift
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair what would
 
04:08:39.050 --> 04:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
you do with the people you apprehend
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
um will you believe are not citizens of
 
04:08:43.969 --> 04:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
the United States yeah so so that's a
 
04:08:45.050 --> 04:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
good question so we're not federal
 
04:08:46.729 --> 04:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
agents but what would happen was the
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
border patrol agents would take them
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
into the Beecher Falls section where
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
they would process them per their
 
04:08:52.319 --> 04:08:55.550 align:start position:0%
they would process them per their
protocol

04:08:55.550 --> 04:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:57.650 --> 04:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
and there won't be any stopping of buses
 
04:09:01.309 --> 04:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
and checking people's passports or
 
04:09:05.570 --> 04:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
well yeah and again there there has been
 
04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion on on checkpoints
 
04:09:11.330 --> 04:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
that have taken place further south but
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
that is not what we are discussing with
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
this program and um this program is
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
focused on the border and if we enhance
 
04:09:20.809 --> 04:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
and we have the other opportunities this
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
gives us is enhance equipment we might
 
04:09:25.550 --> 04:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
need whether it's more four by fours to
 
04:09:28.849 --> 04:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
go off Woods radio equipment that might
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
be needed if we need to make sure they
 
04:09:32.650 --> 04:09:32.660 align:start position:0%
can transfer they can talk
 
04:09:35.450 --> 04:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
interoperability so just to have them
 
04:09:37.610 --> 04:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
out where they need to be and obviously
 
04:09:39.290 --> 04:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
with any of this um there'd be a
 
04:09:41.090 --> 04:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
training component I've worked closely
 
04:09:43.010 --> 04:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office and
 
04:09:44.990 --> 04:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that prior to getting this
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
up and running that we have a training
 
04:09:49.250 --> 04:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
and they have they've agreed to
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
coordinate that get all of the offices
 
04:09:53.330 --> 04:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
together ensure that we have a solid
 
04:09:56.090 --> 04:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
understanding of state law federal law
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
just I'm sure things have done the right
 
04:09:57.840 --> 04:09:58.910 align:start position:0%
just I'm sure things have done the right
way

04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
oh so you're you're looking for drugs
 
04:10:04.729 --> 04:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
coming into the state
 
04:10:06.349 --> 04:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
um weapons coming into the state
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
illegally uh uh people who have
 
04:10:13.490 --> 04:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
um been maybe arrested someplace you
 
04:10:15.530 --> 04:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
know I don't know I just want to make
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
sure it's it's respectful
 
04:10:20.809 --> 04:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
but um because didn't we have during 9
 
04:10:23.450 --> 04:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
11 weren't people some people came down
 
04:10:25.610 --> 04:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
through Canada came down from Canada
 
04:10:27.650 --> 04:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
into I don't know if it was New
 
04:10:29.389 --> 04:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but ultimately they got to
 
04:10:30.650 --> 04:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
Boston it would seem like they went
 
04:10:32.689 --> 04:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire to get there
 
04:10:34.250 --> 04:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure that that
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
the people that were apprehending are
 
04:10:39.650 --> 04:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
the right people to apprehend absolutely
 
04:10:43.370 --> 04:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's respectful yes okay thank you and
 
04:10:44.330 --> 04:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
you're going to come back and tell us
 
04:10:47.570 --> 04:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
all about what your plan is
 
04:10:51.229 --> 04:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you
 
04:10:53.809 --> 04:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I'm just curious
 
04:10:56.090 --> 04:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
um you know this I grew up on the border
 
04:10:58.370 --> 04:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
in Newport and
 
04:10:58.380 --> 04:10:59.510 align:start position:0%
in Newport and
um

04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:02.689 --> 04:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
is there still any kind of a you know as
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
a as a hiker as a hunter you just go
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
back and forth across the border because
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's where the hiking trails went
 
04:11:10.490 --> 04:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
because that's where the deer went is
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
that still um you know is there still
 
04:11:13.729 --> 04:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
will the Canadians come down for hunting
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
do we go across the border because I
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
mean it's not well it's just kind of I I
 
04:11:21.170 --> 04:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
will tell you I I had um I know that
 
04:11:23.689 --> 04:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
when they go out and do these patrols
 
04:11:26.330 --> 04:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes that happens that people are
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
just you know they make a mistake
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
they're going back and forth and I know
 
04:11:30.769 --> 04:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
that they they deal with that
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
educationally you know making sure it's
 
04:11:34.910 --> 04:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
just yes so I mean when you get out
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
there I have never done those patrols
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know that area but I
 
04:11:41.210 --> 04:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
think you know having the right people
 
04:11:43.610 --> 04:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
that are trained to encounter anything
 
04:11:45.650 --> 04:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
and you know quite honestly
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
um there's a uh there's a a medical
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
component of this making sure that if
 
04:11:51.889 --> 04:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
somebody you know needs medical
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
assistance so that they've been hiking
 
04:11:55.790 --> 04:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
they're out in the cold weather they
 
04:11:57.530 --> 04:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
recently had one which has been
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
published uh a Mexican individual across
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
from Canada and to Vermont and and died
 
04:12:06.530 --> 04:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
and so you know the weather up there
 
04:12:09.250 --> 04:12:09.260 align:start position:0%
it's harsh and
 
04:12:13.010 --> 04:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
especially the weather yes sir
 
04:12:14.929 --> 04:12:14.939 align:start position:0%
but the training component is is
 
04:12:17.689 --> 04:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
important we're not just I think that
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know we will we will enhance what we
 
04:12:22.610 --> 04:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
have with stone garden but ensure that
 
04:12:24.650 --> 04:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
we have the right training from the
 
04:12:28.849 --> 04:12:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.859 --> 04:12:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
dad did you have an issue with this
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
as I said I'm fine with the
 
04:12:38.210 --> 04:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
Appropriations I do not plan to support
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
the uh you know changes in the you know
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
authorities I I have full confidence by
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
the way in the intent of the police you
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
know of the law enforcement to use them
 
04:12:47.399 --> 04:12:48.590 align:start position:0%
know of the law enforcement to use them
appropriately

04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
is just given the existing state of the
 
04:12:53.689 --> 04:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
federal laws and everything that aren't
 
04:12:55.849 --> 04:12:55.859 align:start position:0%
absurd overreach I just cannot support
 
04:12:58.490 --> 04:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
an extension of that regardless of how
 
04:13:00.889 --> 04:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
much more highly I think of our you know
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement versus the federal
 
04:13:04.809 --> 04:13:04.819 align:start position:0%
so if we could
 
04:13:08.210 --> 04:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
well the federal thing already has such
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of authority within a
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
hundred miles that I just cannot support
 
04:13:15.530 --> 04:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
another extension to you know the 25
 
04:13:17.809 --> 04:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
miles for us it's
 
04:13:20.450 --> 04:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
they already have the CBP and I hear you
 
04:13:23.150 --> 04:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
that sometimes the CBP is not there but
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
the CBB can already do anything they
 
04:13:27.650 --> 04:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
want within 100 miles I just you know
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
this is not no and I just to clarify
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
this is not giving the federal no no I I
 
04:13:34.610 --> 04:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
understand I I completely understand it
 
04:13:37.250 --> 04:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
as I said it's it's just
 
04:13:39.410 --> 04:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
I I'll be happy to talk offline I don't
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
want to take a lot of committee time
 
04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
right now on it because I don't
 
04:13:42.120 --> 04:13:43.130 align:start position:0%
right now on it because I don't
understand

04:13:43.130 --> 04:13:43.140 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:13:45.889 --> 04:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
supporting the money without
 
04:13:48.650 --> 04:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
the fund they seem to be pretty much
 
04:13:49.849 --> 04:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
tied together what would they do with
 
04:13:52.010 --> 04:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
the money I think no no I'm fine with a
 
04:13:54.110 --> 04:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
fund there is just a portion of the
 
04:13:55.910 --> 04:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
legal language that expands the
 
04:13:58.849 --> 04:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
authority to stop people right and
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's the part of the time objection
 
04:14:02.750 --> 04:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
objecting to here it is but it doesn't
 
04:14:04.010 --> 04:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
apply to this because this is just a
 
04:14:08.090 --> 04:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
board this is not 25 miles this is yeah
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.349 --> 04:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
have the same Authority and powers
 
04:14:20.090 --> 04:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
granted to forest rangers and official
 
04:14:21.769 --> 04:14:21.779 align:start position:0%
of the vision of Forestry and lands
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I mean everything else
 
04:14:25.610 --> 04:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
and please understand it I approve of
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
the effort I agree with your goals I
 
04:14:29.330 --> 04:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
just feel that there is already enough
 
04:14:31.849 --> 04:14:31.859 align:start position:0%
legal authority to be able to do that
 
04:14:37.030 --> 04:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:39.290 --> 04:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
so you're uncomfortable with the
 
04:14:41.090 --> 04:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety having the same
 
04:14:44.210 --> 04:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
Powers as forest rangers
 
04:14:46.969 --> 04:14:46.979 align:start position:0%
correct I believe that in this
 
04:14:49.729 --> 04:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
around the borders constitutional rights
 
04:14:52.070 --> 04:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
have been thoroughly abused by the
 
04:14:55.250 --> 04:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
federal agencies and I believe that at
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
this point in time there is plenty of
 
04:15:00.170 --> 04:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
authority now if that 100 miles Zone
 
04:15:03.650 --> 04:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
from the CBP would be eliminated I would
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
very happily agree to Grant those rights
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
but I believe that there are enough
 
04:15:11.689 --> 04:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
legal you know authorizations in place
 
04:15:13.729 --> 04:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
that more are not needed regardless of
 
04:15:17.170 --> 04:15:17.180 align:start position:0%
the different agencies involved
 
04:15:20.090 --> 04:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
so this came in hb2
 
04:15:22.189 --> 04:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
would this have been something that you
 
04:15:24.650 --> 04:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
wanted in the department of safety or is
 
04:15:27.769 --> 04:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
it because the governor put it in hb2 no
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
I think no we we would want this just to
 
04:15:31.969 --> 04:15:31.979 align:start position:0%
ensure that if our state troopers are
 
04:15:34.490 --> 04:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
out there and they come across somebody
 
04:15:37.010 --> 04:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
Crossing into this land that's spawned
 
04:15:39.170 --> 04:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
by the state forest that they could take
 
04:15:42.530 --> 04:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
the same action that the State Forest
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
officers could do
 
04:15:48.290 --> 04:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
say it was a fishing game and State
 
04:15:50.330 --> 04:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
Forest wasn't the fishing game and a
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
State Trooper or Colebrook uh that
 
04:15:53.809 --> 04:15:53.819 align:start position:0%
that's all we're just looking forward to
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
reduce any liability if we have this
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
fishing game officers they have a lot of
 
04:15:58.560 --> 04:16:01.490 align:start position:0%
fishing game officers they have a lot of
authority

04:16:01.490 --> 04:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I can't speak specifically to if
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
they have this Authority this just says
 
04:16:09.889 --> 04:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
for us so okay thank you yes okay
 
04:16:14.809 --> 04:16:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation yes language three five to
 
04:16:18.600 --> 04:16:20.570 align:start position:0%
appropriation yes language three five to
two

04:16:20.570 --> 04:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:16:23.330 --> 04:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
I accepted
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
okay here so um the next item is on page
 
04:16:46.670 --> 04:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
52 it's item number 148. and what this
 
04:16:48.650 --> 04:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
does is it eliminates the existing
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
statutory cap for hiring auxiliary State
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
Police which are part-time Troopers
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
is currently limited to 16 individuals
 
04:16:59.210 --> 04:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
this eliminates the number from statute
 
04:17:01.610 --> 04:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
and puts the Restriction within our our
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
operating budget so if the funds are
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
available we can hire the the Troopers
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
if the funds are not available we cannot
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay questions to the committee
 
04:17:15.469 --> 04:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
the next item which is also page 52 item
 
04:17:19.319 --> 04:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
the next item which is also page 52 item
149

04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
149
 
04:17:21.120 --> 04:17:22.490 align:start position:0%
149
um

04:17:22.490 --> 04:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:24.410 --> 04:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
in summary this has to do with the fire
 
04:17:27.110 --> 04:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
fund fees so these are fees that are
 
04:17:28.990 --> 04:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
collected for motor vehicle records
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
primarily insurance companies collect
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
this data there are some other
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
authorized users as well
 
04:17:38.090 --> 04:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
the fees are set by Statute currently
 
04:17:40.250 --> 04:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
this would eliminate the fees from
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
statute but add the requirement that the
 
04:17:44.229 --> 04:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
department set fees through
 
04:17:46.849 --> 04:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking instead and
 
04:17:48.050 --> 04:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
what that does is it allows the
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
department to
 
04:17:49.739 --> 04:17:50.389 align:start position:0%
department to
um

04:17:50.389 --> 04:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
greater flexibility to increase fees
 
04:17:56.450 --> 04:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
when needed to ensure the operations can
 
04:17:56.460 --> 04:17:57.769 align:start position:0%
when needed to ensure the operations can
continue

04:17:57.769 --> 04:17:57.779 align:start position:0%
continue
 
04:17:59.630 --> 04:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
just there's still a lot of
 
04:18:02.330 --> 04:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
accountability though because you still
 
04:18:04.130 --> 04:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
have to go through gel car and the whole
 
04:18:06.530 --> 04:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority so
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
it still won't process it's still a long
 
04:18:11.090 --> 04:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
process we will have to go through rule
 
04:18:11.100 --> 04:18:11.929 align:start position:0%
process we will have to go through rule
making

04:18:11.929 --> 04:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
making
 
04:18:14.269 --> 04:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
um we we would have to go through an
 
04:18:16.729 --> 04:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
expedited version of that because of the
 
04:18:19.130 --> 04:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
timing of this change so that we could
 
04:18:22.010 --> 04:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
still charge fees as of July 1. thank
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
you but that process does exist through
 
04:18:26.450 --> 04:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
that through through jail card other
 
04:18:26.460 --> 04:18:27.889 align:start position:0%
that through through jail card other
questions

04:18:27.889 --> 04:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay all the members are coming in favor
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
of this item
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous
 
04:18:38.590 --> 04:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
the next item uh is 150 on the same page
 
04:18:41.689 --> 04:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh this is related to those fees and the
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
entities who are allowed to utilize the
 
04:18:45.370 --> 04:18:45.380 align:start position:0%
driving history records
 
04:18:48.769 --> 04:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
this language allows
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
um Federal entities in certain instances
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
to utilize these records in the same way
 
04:18:55.729 --> 04:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
that a commercial entity would like an
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company or some other
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
authorized agent these this change is
 
04:19:02.450 --> 04:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
required based on our estimates to
 
04:19:04.729 --> 04:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
ensure that we do have enough Revenue
 
04:19:06.769 --> 04:19:06.779 align:start position:0%
collected from the fees to support both
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
fire safety and fire standards and
 
04:19:09.120 --> 04:19:11.990 align:start position:0%
fire safety and fire standards and
training

04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I'm just
 
04:19:16.610 --> 04:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how does this
 
04:19:18.530 --> 04:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
change allow you to achieve that goal
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
are you planning to basically sell the
 
04:19:23.929 --> 04:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
data to the federal you know government
 
04:19:25.610 --> 04:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
just like you would to a commercial
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
entity correct correct so the language
 
04:19:30.170 --> 04:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
prohibits the federal government from
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
establishing databases using this data
 
04:19:33.540 --> 04:19:34.250 align:start position:0%
establishing databases using this data
um

04:19:34.250 --> 04:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
and so this would allow the federal
 
04:19:38.150 --> 04:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
government to utilize the data in the
 
04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
same way as as a corporate entity would
 
04:19:41.870 --> 04:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
so they would have access to it but
 
04:19:41.880 --> 04:19:42.950 align:start position:0%
so they would have access to it but
couldn't

04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
04:19:45.050 --> 04:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
um couldn't use it to create a a
 
04:19:45.060 --> 04:19:46.610 align:start position:0%
um couldn't use it to create a a
database

04:19:46.610 --> 04:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
database
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the clarification I don't
 
04:19:50.929 --> 04:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
really trust the federal government's
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
willingness to abide by that but given
 
04:19:54.889 --> 04:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
that we anyway give it to a commercial
 
04:19:56.929 --> 04:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
entity the feds could buy from there
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
anyway so you know I'll leave with this
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:01.849 --> 04:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
for years
 
04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
04:20:05.630 --> 04:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee are in
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
favor of this item
 
04:20:07.560 --> 04:20:11.210 align:start position:0%
favor of this item
okay

04:20:11.210 --> 04:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.070 --> 04:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to page three of the
 
04:20:13.080 --> 04:20:14.630 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to page three of the
handout

04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
handout
 
04:20:14.640 --> 04:20:17.450 align:start position:0%
handout
uh

04:20:17.450 --> 04:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:20.929 --> 04:20:20.939 align:start position:0%
so this item in House Bill 2 which is on
 
04:20:24.170 --> 04:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
page 53.
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 2 this transfers the
 
04:20:27.769 --> 04:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
requirement to make one annual
 
04:20:30.050 --> 04:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
unannounced inspection of licensed
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
facilities from Health and Human
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
Services to the fire marshal in
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
discussing this with HHS we realize that
 
04:20:39.530 --> 04:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
there are two levels of authority that
 
04:20:42.170 --> 04:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
HHS have to provide inspections the one
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to transfer is later in
 
04:20:46.370 --> 04:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
the bill this particular one we don't
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
want to transfer and HHS does not want
 
04:20:51.650 --> 04:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
to transfer and so we're asking that
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
this amendment be struck but this
 
04:20:58.490 --> 04:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
amendment not be voted forward HHS is an
 
04:21:00.889 --> 04:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
agreement to this there are implications
 
04:21:05.210 --> 04:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
to CMS that I don't understand entirely
 
04:21:06.650 --> 04:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
but they've shared with us saying this
 
04:21:09.229 --> 04:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
could be a problem and they have the
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
resources to do it item number 151 on
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:19.370 --> 04:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
I'm just getting clarification so in the
 
04:21:20.450 --> 04:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
end who's going to do the fire
 
04:21:20.460 --> 04:21:21.889 align:start position:0%
end who's going to do the fire
inspections

04:21:21.889 --> 04:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
04:21:24.170 --> 04:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
so Health and Human Services will be
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for all of their for
 
04:21:27.650 --> 04:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
inspecting all these facilities and they
 
04:21:28.910 --> 04:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
work in conjunction with the Fire
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
Marshal's Office
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
and so this original thing was to move
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
the fire thing under your jurisdiction
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
but you're happy that it stays at HHS
 
04:21:38.990 --> 04:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're both in agreement it should stay
 
04:21:41.330 --> 04:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
there there's another component of
 
04:21:43.250 --> 04:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
inspections related to plans for
 
04:21:45.170 --> 04:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
construction new
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
um new construction and enhancements and
 
04:21:49.849 --> 04:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
then initial inspections of those plans
 
04:21:52.010 --> 04:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
which we'll talk about later which
 
04:21:56.330 --> 04:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
should still move thanks okay so the
 
04:22:01.130 --> 04:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
vote is to strike strike this item all
 
04:22:03.170 --> 04:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
04:22:09.050 --> 04:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:11.809 --> 04:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
all right the next item is
 
04:22:15.410 --> 04:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
number 152 on page 53.
 
04:22:17.570 --> 04:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
and this establishes a program assistant
 
04:22:19.849 --> 04:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
to within the division of fire safety
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
and appropriates the funds to support
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
that position to perform fire code
 
04:22:25.319 --> 04:22:26.809 align:start position:0%
that position to perform fire code
Amendment

04:22:26.809 --> 04:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:22:26.819 --> 04:22:27.889 align:start position:0%
Amendment
um

04:22:27.889 --> 04:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:30.590 --> 04:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
updates and postings as required by a
 
04:22:32.689 --> 04:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
law that was passed last session it was
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 443 and at the very end of
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
the that legislative session and that
 
04:22:40.250 --> 04:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
bill it was realized that this position
 
04:22:43.010 --> 04:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
was inadvertently left out of of the
 
04:22:45.050 --> 04:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
bill when we were asked to add it back
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
in during the budget process and so
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's what this language would do
 
04:22:54.530 --> 04:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.889 --> 04:22:57.899 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of this item
 
04:22:57.899 --> 04:23:00.830 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of this item
okay

04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.929 --> 04:23:02.939 align:start position:0%
the next item
 
04:23:06.590 --> 04:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
um it's actually both item 153 and 154
 
04:23:08.990 --> 04:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
and these have to do with authorizations
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
related to our positions of the
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety the first allows us
 
04:23:14.929 --> 04:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
to fill unfunded positions so long as
 
04:23:16.969 --> 04:23:16.979 align:start position:0%
we're using the budgeted funds in class
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
10 so we can't go over our budget and
 
04:23:21.889 --> 04:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
the second would allow us to establish
 
04:23:25.250 --> 04:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
full-time uh temporary class 59
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
positions if somebody is on extended
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
military leave and just establishing
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
that position through administrative
 
04:23:32.750 --> 04:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
services in that case without having to
 
04:23:34.969 --> 04:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
go through the existing process which
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
requires fiscal committee approval
 
04:23:40.849 --> 04:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
okay questions to committee
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of this item
 
04:23:43.920 --> 04:23:47.050 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of this item
okay

04:23:47.050 --> 04:23:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.210 --> 04:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
153 154.
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
right next item is 155 on page 53 and
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is appropriating funds to this
 
04:23:58.729 --> 04:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
existing substance abuse enforcement
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
program and this is a program that
 
04:24:03.530 --> 04:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
supports additional narcotics
 
04:24:05.570 --> 04:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
investigations activities at State
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
Police as well as grants to locals and
 
04:24:10.809 --> 04:24:10.819 align:start position:0%
it's utilizing data-driven intelligence
 
04:24:14.689 --> 04:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
to help combat the narcotics problem
 
04:24:18.130 --> 04:24:18.140 align:start position:0%
opioids and others as well
 
04:24:21.170 --> 04:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
289 000 is appropriate to State Police
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
narcotics investigations unit 119
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
000 is appropriated to the forensic lab
 
04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
when they're doing the analysis on
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
seizures and then uh 1.6 1.7 million is
 
04:24:35.570 --> 04:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
appropriated for Grants to locals also
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
included in those Amounts is the five
 
04:24:37.439 --> 04:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
included in those Amounts is the five
percent

04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:24:43.090 --> 04:24:43.100 align:start position:0%
um that's required by RSA 604
 
04:24:46.729 --> 04:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
A1 dash C to transfer to the judicial
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
Council for any Grant activities that
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
are generally funded that could increase
 
04:24:51.359 --> 04:24:53.650 align:start position:0%
are generally funded that could increase
the

04:24:53.650 --> 04:24:53.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:56.150 --> 04:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
arrests and then the need for Indigent
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
defense and so that's included Within
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
These Appropriations
 
04:25:03.710 --> 04:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
questions I hope you're doing some work
 
04:25:05.929 --> 04:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
in Manchester
 
04:25:07.969 --> 04:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with Chief
 
04:25:10.130 --> 04:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
altenberg because we really have a
 
04:25:10.140 --> 04:25:11.030 align:start position:0%
altenberg because we really have a
problem

04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:25:12.590 --> 04:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
all you have to do is walk down the
 
04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
street it's everywhere it's crisis
 
04:25:15.180 --> 04:25:16.189 align:start position:0%
street it's everywhere it's crisis
levels

04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
levels
 
04:25:18.769 --> 04:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
Joshua funds
 
04:25:25.370 --> 04:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:27.170 --> 04:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:29.809 --> 04:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
um one of the items is for you know
 
04:25:32.809 --> 04:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
funding overtime at the State Police for
 
04:25:37.010 --> 04:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:39.649 --> 04:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
obviously you know you have a backlog of
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
cases you gotta you know have over time
 
04:25:42.000 --> 04:25:43.130 align:start position:0%
cases you gotta you know have over time
but

04:25:43.130 --> 04:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:25:45.769 --> 04:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
generally it is more effective under
 
04:25:47.929 --> 04:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
most situations to just you know have
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
another full-time equivalent and uh you
 
04:25:52.010 --> 04:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
know pay them at the normal rate is this
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
one of those situations where overtime
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
is needed and if so why do we do over
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
time instead of just a you know
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
full-time position or a part-time
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
position that's a good that's a great
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
question so these really are um they're
 
04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
really unique positions they're
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
Specialties so those men and women
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
assigned to the narcotics Investigation
 
04:26:15.110 --> 04:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
Unit have had some Advanced Training
 
04:26:16.849 --> 04:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
um there they could be undercover
 
04:26:19.729 --> 04:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
operatives uh they're trained in you
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
know surveillance techniques and um so
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
it really is giving them the funds those
 
04:26:28.910 --> 04:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
specific individuals to continue to work
 
04:26:31.729 --> 04:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
these cases which a lot of times just go
 
04:26:34.210 --> 04:26:34.220 align:start position:0%
beyond a normal you know eight hour day
 
04:26:36.889 --> 04:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
and so there really isn't like a you
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
know a second shift that can come in and
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I was sorting out which how much
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
money goes where can you speak to the
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of granite Shield
 
04:26:58.250 --> 04:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you hear you know back and forth that
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's effective you hear that it's not
 
04:27:02.689 --> 04:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
effective can you um speak to that
 
04:27:05.929 --> 04:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
so I would say I have asked that
 
04:27:07.370 --> 04:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
question didn't ask that question many
 
04:27:08.689 --> 04:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
times and
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
um to not give to give an opinion what I
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
would say is this I think it's important
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
to point out that based on the efforts
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
of granite Shield those officers that
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
are working across the state
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
collaboratively in two in FY 22 what
 
04:27:26.750 --> 04:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
they removed what came in in fentanyl
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
equated to what the lab says is 673
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
000 potential fatal doses
 
04:27:39.170 --> 04:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
and through 12 31 22 they removed 528
 
04:27:42.110 --> 04:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
000 potential fatal doses so those went
 
04:27:43.849 --> 04:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
from the street
 
04:27:46.670 --> 04:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
to the police officer to the crime lab
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
so in and of itself it's hard to
 
04:27:51.469 --> 04:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
quantify or predict what that's saved
 
04:27:54.530 --> 04:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
but that in and of itself shows that um
 
04:27:56.809 --> 04:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
that that is effective in removing
 
04:27:58.370 --> 04:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
dangerous drugs
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
so that I think that's the best evidence
 
04:28:02.809 --> 04:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
I can
 
04:28:04.849 --> 04:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
bring forward
 
04:28:07.010 --> 04:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work to that too to
 
04:28:10.010 --> 04:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
seize these drugs there's surveillance
 
04:28:12.349 --> 04:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
there's undercover buys at times there's
 
04:28:14.210 --> 04:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
you know applications of search warrants
 
04:28:16.849 --> 04:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work to put a case from
 
04:28:19.070 --> 04:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
start to finish and then and then done
 
04:28:21.050 --> 04:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
safely you know they work very hard out
 
04:28:21.060 --> 04:28:23.330 align:start position:0%
safely you know they work very hard out
there

04:28:23.330 --> 04:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:26.330 --> 04:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee in favor of
 
04:28:29.210 --> 04:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
this item
 
04:28:35.330 --> 04:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:37.309 --> 04:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
the next item
 
04:28:39.889 --> 04:28:39.899 align:start position:0%
is on page
 
04:28:48.530 --> 04:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.410 --> 04:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
and what this does is
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
it authorizes the administration of
 
04:28:58.370 --> 04:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
naloxone for an if an individual is um
 
04:29:01.330 --> 04:29:01.340 align:start position:0%
show signs of an over of a drug overdose
 
04:29:03.969 --> 04:29:03.979 align:start position:0%
from fentanyl or heroin
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
it authorizes that Administration
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
without a license so currently
 
04:29:11.389 --> 04:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
if you're an emergency response
 
04:29:13.010 --> 04:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
professional you're required to be
 
04:29:17.149 --> 04:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
there are some police officers who are
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
and there are some who aren't and this
 
04:29:24.110 --> 04:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
would allow those who aren't to respond
 
04:29:26.090 --> 04:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
in a situation like that instead of have
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
forcing them to wait for someone else
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
who's license to come forward and it
 
04:29:34.189 --> 04:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
treats I'm sorry if I recall correctly
 
04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you know way more about the
 
04:29:39.290 --> 04:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
topic naloxone is available you know to
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
regular people
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
and it is deemed generally to be safe to
 
04:29:46.729 --> 04:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
administer even if that wasn't a drug
 
04:29:48.889 --> 04:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
overdose but it can be a lifesaver so
 
04:29:51.410 --> 04:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a huge upside but very
 
04:29:54.649 --> 04:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
little if any downside in using so I'm
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
kind of questioning why we need that
 
04:29:58.610 --> 04:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
license to start with to be fair but I
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
have no problem with the you know this
 
04:30:02.450 --> 04:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
language that would allow life-saving
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
drugs to be administered without waiting
 
04:30:06.170 --> 04:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
for somebody who carries a piece of
 
04:30:10.010 --> 04:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:12.530 --> 04:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:30:14.090 --> 04:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
okay members of committee in favor of
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
this item
 
04:30:15.960 --> 04:30:20.689 align:start position:0%
this item
okay

04:30:20.689 --> 04:30:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
the next item is on page 54 158
 
04:30:29.090 --> 04:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
um what this item does is it amends RSA
 
04:30:31.969 --> 04:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
153 to authorize employee organizations
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
to establish peer support groups that
 
04:30:36.530 --> 04:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
are confidential so right now an
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
employee organization can establish a
 
04:30:40.130 --> 04:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
peer support group but there's no
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality under the law if an
 
04:30:44.210 --> 04:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
individual goes in to that group as
 
04:30:46.250 --> 04:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
opposed to if they go to the employer
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
established peer support group we're
 
04:30:50.330 --> 04:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
talking about emergency response
 
04:30:54.290 --> 04:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
Professionals in that that industry and
 
04:30:57.050 --> 04:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
what we know is that individuals are
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
less likely to seek peer support uh if
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%

04:31:06.410 --> 04:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
questions for the board
 
04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
where in Norwich in hb2 is that that is
 
04:31:16.969 --> 04:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.729 --> 04:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
is this just for state workers or
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
everybody no I think I think it's
 
04:31:32.929 --> 04:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
important to know to authorize employee
 
04:31:34.610 --> 04:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
organizations so if there's an
 
04:31:36.769 --> 04:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
organization that they can establish and
 
04:31:38.689 --> 04:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
have the same confidentiality we're just
 
04:31:40.309 --> 04:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
looking to ex to make sure that they
 
04:31:42.050 --> 04:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
expand a form or something say that I
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
will keep all proceedings confidential
 
04:31:46.490 --> 04:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
yeah there's there's training that's
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
required for that organization to
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
operate as a peer support unit thank you
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%

please raise your hand

04:32:16.979 --> 04:32:17.689 align:start position:0%
okay the next item page 56 159
um

04:32:17.689 --> 04:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:19.929 --> 04:32:19.939 align:start position:0%
this suspends
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
rsa99b2 which is a statute that limits
 
04:32:24.349 --> 04:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
the percentage of Highway fund
 
04:32:24.359 --> 04:32:25.969 align:start position:0%
the percentage of Highway fund
allocations

04:32:25.969 --> 04:32:25.979 align:start position:0%
allocations
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
um that the department of safety can
 
04:32:30.530 --> 04:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
utilize over the biennium and there's
 
04:32:32.450 --> 04:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
some question as to whether we even need
 
04:32:37.729 --> 04:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
I was very proud of the fact I passed
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
this to Control Commission of Flynn
 
04:32:47.290 --> 04:32:47.300 align:start position:0%
who one year went out and bought 567
 
04:32:51.170 --> 04:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
2001 crowd Crown Victorious
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
because he thought the guys like that
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
they're not making them anymore
 
04:32:57.170 --> 04:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
and most of them you probably remember
 
04:32:59.570 --> 04:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
some have sat in the field
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
for years
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
and and it said where do you get this
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
Authority so and the dot would come to
 
04:33:10.429 --> 04:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
us he's taken all our money
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
so it took me a while to pass this but
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
this was my solution
 
04:33:17.689 --> 04:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
having some of this unbridled he also
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
went to a display of fire equipment
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
brand new fire engines
 
04:33:25.609 --> 04:33:25.619 align:start position:0%
and he witnessed it he said to the
 
04:33:27.051 --> 04:33:27.061 align:start position:0%
manufacturers when they got through what
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
are you going to do with these I guess
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
we'll put them up for sale what kind of
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
deal can you give me he didn't have an
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation for that but he bought him
 
04:33:35.631 --> 04:33:35.641 align:start position:0%
put him in the fire academy
 
04:33:38.209 --> 04:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
so it was it was times that he felt like
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
we felt like he was going
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled nobody dared do anything
 
04:33:47.449 --> 04:33:47.459 align:start position:0%
so I put in this 26 percent the highway
 
04:33:50.209 --> 04:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
department was very happy about it
 
04:33:52.609 --> 04:33:52.619 align:start position:0%
because obviously safety collects the
 
04:33:52.619 --> 04:33:53.631 align:start position:0%
because obviously safety collects the
money

04:33:53.631 --> 04:33:53.641 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
Highway doesn't know how much money you
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
collected until you give them what what
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
you what they feel what you feel like
 
04:33:59.760 --> 04:34:01.070 align:start position:0%
you what they feel what you feel like
so

04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:03.650 --> 04:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
there was a conflict here
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
is it do you think you're going to spend
 
04:34:08.810 --> 04:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
more than 26 percent
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
so I'd turn it over to LDA on that one
 
04:34:15.170 --> 04:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
so safety and Dot are bound by what you
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate there's no kind of open
 
04:34:20.090 --> 04:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
checkbook so to speak or blank check for
 
04:34:21.529 --> 04:34:21.539 align:start position:0%
either Department there is the authority
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
to come to fiscal that's the only uh
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
option they've got what we'll do is make
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
sure that the budget that you pass is
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
compliant with RSA 99b and if not the
 
04:34:33.709 --> 04:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
suspension could remain but as of right
 
04:34:35.150 --> 04:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
now and as it came out of the governor's
 
04:34:37.789 --> 04:34:37.799 align:start position:0%
office it's compliant so this suspension
 
04:34:40.670 --> 04:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
is not really needed right now if
 
04:34:41.810 --> 04:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
depending on the decisions this
 
04:34:44.570 --> 04:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
committee makes it becomes relevant we
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
can discuss that then but I think
 
04:34:49.250 --> 04:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
I'll continue to monitor the work that
 
04:34:52.010 --> 04:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
the committee does and and if that's
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
needed we'll include it if not we'll
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.449 --> 04:34:59.459 align:start position:0%
sir you lost me
 
04:35:01.689 --> 04:35:01.699 align:start position:0%
Well for now just I think you can just
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
ignore it ignore it for now because it
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
would be contingent upon budgetary
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
decisions this committee makes moving
 
04:35:07.439 --> 04:35:08.869 align:start position:0%
decisions this committee makes moving
forward

04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
I think we may have in other budgets
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
exceeded it
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have had budgets where it was
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
exceeded and the suspension was required
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
about six years ago it was Rewritten if
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
you recall
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
betterment is a dedicated part of the
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
road toll that just goes to Dot and the
 
04:35:31.849 --> 04:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
4.2 Cent increase is a dedicated portion
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
of road toll that only goes to dot those
 
04:35:36.650 --> 04:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
allocations didn't used to be part of
 
04:35:39.109 --> 04:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
this calculation we changed the law so
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
they would be and when that happened the
 
04:35:43.849 --> 04:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
necessity for the suspension has kind of
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
gone away because those funds were 100
 
04:35:48.650 --> 04:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
to dot but they weren't really reflected
 
04:35:50.631 --> 04:35:50.641 align:start position:0%
in that calculation but now they are I
 
04:35:53.631 --> 04:35:53.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:53.641 --> 04:35:56.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:35:56.810 --> 04:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
all right the next item page 57 item 161
 
04:36:02.159 --> 04:36:02.169 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriation
 
04:36:02.169 --> 04:36:03.590 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriation
[Music]

04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:36:03.600 --> 04:36:04.849 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:36:04.849 --> 04:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry I skipped one
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
Cody oh
 
04:36:14.810 --> 04:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
160 yep page 56 160. just keep doing it
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
so this is a cyber security grant
 
04:36:18.289 --> 04:36:18.299 align:start position:0%
program this is a Homeland Security
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
Federal grant funded program
 
04:36:23.570 --> 04:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
multi-year multi-million dollars to
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
improve cyber security in the state
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
um we have brought an item forward to
 
04:36:33.010 --> 04:36:33.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal and GNC recently for 2.4 million
 
04:36:35.330 --> 04:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
and these are the matching fund
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
requirements that for FY 14 and FY fy14
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
FY 24 and fy25 based on what we expect
 
04:36:49.490 --> 04:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:51.529 --> 04:36:51.539 align:start position:0%
um these are yes these would be General
 
04:36:51.539 --> 04:36:54.590 align:start position:0%
um these are yes these would be General
funded

04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.131 --> 04:36:58.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
that what's in favor of this item
 
04:37:00.359 --> 04:37:02.330 align:start position:0%
that what's in favor of this item
oh

04:37:02.330 --> 04:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:37:05.090 --> 04:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
what it will do you have to fraud
 
04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
um just cyber bad things happening
 
04:37:13.010 --> 04:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
um yes all of that so bad guys out so so
 
04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a cyber security
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
um group uh
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
is it the planning committee
 
04:37:23.650 --> 04:37:23.660 align:start position:0%
um and so that's chaired by uh our CIO
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner Dennis Goulet we've got
 
04:37:28.609 --> 04:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
representation from local government on
 
04:37:31.609 --> 04:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
there public safety Public Health it's
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
really looking at the state local and
 
04:37:36.830 --> 04:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
County government systems in New
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and one helping to train and
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
educate the individuals responsible for
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
those and two working on other
 
04:37:45.650 --> 04:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
collaborative ways that we can increase
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
cyber security across our networks and
 
04:37:49.390 --> 04:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
our systems to prevent
 
04:37:52.250 --> 04:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
large-scale issues from shutting things
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
down you hear about ransomware you hear
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
about small towns who now can't function
 
04:37:57.949 --> 04:37:57.959 align:start position:0%
because their systems have been they've
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
been locked out of their systems so it's
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
it's a multi multi-year multi-faceted
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
approach to cyber security for
 
04:38:04.320 --> 04:38:06.910 align:start position:0%
approach to cyber security for
government

04:38:06.910 --> 04:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:09.650 --> 04:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
just very briefly more of a statement
 
04:38:09.660 --> 04:38:11.090 align:start position:0%
just very briefly more of a statement
it's

04:38:11.090 --> 04:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:38:13.970 --> 04:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
it's a place where smaller governmental
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
entities have a hard time getting the
 
04:38:17.449 --> 04:38:17.459 align:start position:0%
expertise to deal with this so having
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
something at the state level to provide
 
04:38:21.890 --> 04:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
proper guidelines and Equipment can be
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
very very effective and beneficial so I
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea to you know
 
04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
provide those resources
 
04:38:31.010 --> 04:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
we're all on the committee in favor of
 
04:38:32.689 --> 04:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
this item
 
04:38:32.699 --> 04:38:37.010 align:start position:0%
this item
okay

04:38:37.010 --> 04:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:40.369 --> 04:38:40.379 align:start position:0%
speaking of cars
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
not quite as many as representative
 
04:38:44.510 --> 04:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
Wilder just mentioned but the Chairman's
 
04:38:44.520 --> 04:38:49.631 align:start position:0%
Wilder just mentioned but the Chairman's
favorite

04:38:49.631 --> 04:38:49.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
Topic's a good car they don't make them
 
04:38:52.199 --> 04:38:56.689 align:start position:0%
Topic's a good car they don't make them
anymore

04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.699 --> 04:38:57.949 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:38:57.949 --> 04:38:57.959 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:39:01.131 --> 04:39:01.141 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so so this item which is page
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
57 161 this appropriates 3.5 million
 
04:39:07.250 --> 04:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
dollars to purchase 52 Cruisers and we
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
spoke about this one a little bit in our
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
budget presentation we do have uh 70
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
vehicles in uh year one and I believe
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's 72 in year two in our operating
 
04:39:19.970 --> 04:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
budget these are additional one-time
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
purchases to resolve the fact that over
 
04:39:24.529 --> 04:39:24.539 align:start position:0%
the last several biennium because of
 
04:39:26.209 --> 04:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
budgetary constraints we didn't have
 
04:39:28.490 --> 04:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to fulfill our
 
04:39:30.410 --> 04:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
replacement plan and we also had
 
04:39:33.230 --> 04:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
challenges in purchasing vehicles for
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations that we did have
 
04:39:37.690 --> 04:39:37.700 align:start position:0%
because of supply chain issues so the
 
04:39:40.850 --> 04:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
these additional purchases will help to
 
04:39:43.010 --> 04:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
resolve the health issues and the state
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
police Fleet moving forward and allow us
 
04:39:48.050 --> 04:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
to come forward in future biennium with
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
with more regular and stable maintenance
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
and repair and replacement requests
 
04:39:55.130 --> 04:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you these are
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
specialized cars and so I'm curious what
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
do you do with the old cars that these
 
04:40:00.530 --> 04:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
will replace
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
so the old cars get um Surplus through
 
04:40:06.110 --> 04:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
the white Farm all of the
 
04:40:08.208 --> 04:40:08.218 align:start position:0%
um uh so the state that's the State
 
04:40:10.610 --> 04:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
Surplus process so it goes through
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
administrative services and they operate
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
a um they operate a surplus auction
 
04:40:17.868 --> 04:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
um two times a year and these vehicles
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
are auctioned off the monies that um are
 
04:40:23.630 --> 04:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
earned from those sales go back to the
 
04:40:25.610 --> 04:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
funds that they were purchased with so
 
04:40:26.930 --> 04:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
if we purchase the vehicle with Highway
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
funds the sale money goes back to the
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.490 --> 04:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.010 --> 04:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
question source of funds
 
04:40:53.230 --> 04:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
this is already in the governor's yeah
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
to confirm this is already accounted for
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the governor's yeah past budget or
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.600 --> 04:41:10.368 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:41:10.368 --> 04:41:10.378 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:41:10.378 --> 04:41:15.410 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

04:41:15.410 --> 04:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't vote this one yet
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
oh all in favor
 
04:41:20.638 --> 04:41:25.490 align:start position:0%
oh all in favor
okay

04:41:25.490 --> 04:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:27.948 --> 04:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
last but not least this is page 78 item
 
04:41:34.570 --> 04:41:34.580 align:start position:0%
225 health facility licensing inspection
 
04:41:38.690 --> 04:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
so this goes back to the item that we
 
04:41:42.288 --> 04:41:42.298 align:start position:0%
asked to be struck from house bill to
 
04:41:42.298 --> 04:41:43.128 align:start position:0%
asked to be struck from house bill to
um

04:41:43.128 --> 04:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
both HHS and fire safety agree we do
 
04:41:48.890 --> 04:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
want to transfer this Authority for new
 
04:41:52.010 --> 04:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
construction or facility alteration plan
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
review inspection and approval from HHS
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the Fire Marshal's Office so this is
 
04:42:01.010 --> 04:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
a function that was performed at HHS
 
04:42:03.770 --> 04:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
with two full-time positions but they
 
04:42:06.288 --> 04:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
struggled to train and hire people
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not really their line of
 
04:42:09.890 --> 04:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
business and it made sense to bring this
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
Into the Fire Marshal's Office where
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
they have Engineers who already
 
04:42:15.410 --> 04:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
performed this function for other state
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
buildings and state agencies the key to
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
language is and I and I provided you an
 
04:42:26.090 --> 04:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
updated version of our prioritized needs
 
04:42:28.490 --> 04:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
listing the very first item there are
 
04:42:31.150 --> 04:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
the two positions that would be required
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
in order for this transfer to occur yeah
 
04:42:35.810 --> 04:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
are the position can be transferred from
 
04:42:38.690 --> 04:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
DHHS to you no the positions were
 
04:42:41.570 --> 04:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
abolished by DHHS so they reduced their
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
budget by this dollar amount which we
 
04:42:46.270 --> 04:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
coordinated with them on okay um
 
04:42:49.010 --> 04:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
but in essence we're picking it up yes
 
04:42:51.050 --> 04:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
yep but we do need to establish these
 
04:42:51.060 --> 04:42:52.310 align:start position:0%
yep but we do need to establish these
positions

04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
positions
 
04:42:59.330 --> 04:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:02.570 --> 04:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
um hb2 it's page four of the of the
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
oh hp2 page I'm sorry page 78
 
04:43:12.288 --> 04:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
item 225 health facility licensing
 
04:43:12.298 --> 04:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
item 225 health facility licensing
inspection

04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll clarify for the committee this
 
04:43:17.930 --> 04:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
is not on our working index so which is
 
04:43:19.010 --> 04:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
maybe why you don't see it in our
 
04:43:20.448 --> 04:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
document this was a division three
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
assigned section but it is related to
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
what uh okay what we're talking about
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
here so assuming division three keeps it
 
04:43:28.970 --> 04:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
in these positions should be considered
 
04:43:31.368 --> 04:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
by us all right
 
04:43:33.770 --> 04:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:43:37.570 --> 04:43:37.580 align:start position:0%
yes so who's been doing the inspections
 
04:43:40.128 --> 04:43:40.138 align:start position:0%
HHS has but they didn't have any people
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
to do it well I I I don't want to say
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
there there wasn't anyone in the role so
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
maybe delay they had struggles in
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
filling both positions at all times and
 
04:43:51.050 --> 04:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
so that caused delays in the program and
 
04:43:52.128 --> 04:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
you you're going to be able to find
 
04:43:55.610 --> 04:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
people uh we we expect to because we are
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
able to we have other individuals who
 
04:43:57.840 --> 04:43:58.610 align:start position:0%
able to we have other individuals who
are

04:43:58.610 --> 04:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
um uh engineers and are able to perform
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
that work so if there's delays in hiring
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
we could have someone else step in and
 
04:44:11.150 --> 04:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
no these are group one
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
and we've coordinated with the fire
 
04:44:17.330 --> 04:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
marshal Sean Toomey who's an engineer
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
who oversees this so he's well aware
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
that this is coming
 
04:44:24.590 --> 04:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
no you have to push it
 
04:44:26.990 --> 04:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay all in favor of this item please
 
04:44:32.690 --> 04:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.208 --> 04:44:35.218 align:start position:0%
to confirm Mr chair is that the item in
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 with the corresponding
 
04:44:39.770 --> 04:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
positions yes okay so the we would
 
04:44:41.150 --> 04:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
change this in house bill one and I
 
04:44:42.288 --> 04:44:42.298 align:start position:0%
would add those positions to that
 
04:44:45.708 --> 04:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
at least that's my understanding
 
04:44:50.868 --> 04:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
that that certainly is the request I
 
04:44:51.890 --> 04:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure everyone in the
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee is aware of the kind of a
 
04:44:55.788 --> 04:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
two-step uh
 
04:44:59.448 --> 04:44:59.458 align:start position:0%
approval there okay thank you thank you
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%

to next week and like I said I still
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a request into the governor's
