00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
all right the time being 10:08 I would
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
like to get started with today's work
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
session and I will open the work session
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
324 and I think we have a an amendment
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
from representative PL hand it out
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative PL yeah during uh the
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 324 the
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission had a concern that
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
they uh annunciated uh that uh this
 
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
should apply only the annual licenses
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
like a small like a quarter or less of
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
their uh LIC licenses are are monthly or
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
quarterly it just wouldn't work and so
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
they and so I have an amendment here
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
that uh strikes the sentence and adds a
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
similar sentence at least 45 days prior
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
to the expiration of an annual license
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
issued in accordance with this chapter
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
the commission shall notify the
 
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
licensing of the pending expiration so
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
it clearly applies only to annual
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
licenses now they said they they have to
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
do this anyway under RSA 541 a29 and 541
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
a30 this refers spe explicitly to 541
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
830 I did leave a uh a request on their
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh website email uh and I never got an
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
answer but this did Cover what uh I
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
think the the concerns were in
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you representative
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
shamberg uh representative PL uh your
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
last in lines 13 and 14 of the amendment
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
are different than lines 12 13 and 14 of
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
the original Bill uh you reduced
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
something there is that because you put
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
the sentences above on six and seven and
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
eight well let me get the original Bill
 
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.670 align:start position:0%
eight well let me get the original Bill

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
right all I did was insert a couple of
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
lines that's it no no no well that's
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
what I did what what the drafters did
 
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.550 align:start position:0%

00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
right but talks about the
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
re revoking or suspending under this
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
section by the commission no less than
 
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
suspension well it it's by referring to
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
541 830 all of that's there the
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%

to be struck because we can't give a
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%

363 I don't think we have um an
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative PL this uh
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
several years ago we got rid of
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
greyhound racing because of the abuse
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
that the animals were put under this
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
this eliminates uh the sill cast uh uh
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
for greyhound racing that's all it is
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
there is a economic a small economic
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
impact but to me it's it's uh it's got
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
to be small part of overall revenues and
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
we live up to our word uh about uh uh
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
the greyhound racing and the abuse of
 
00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
the dogs are undertaking uh but we still
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
have uh horse racing which is fine
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing so I don't see a
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
one okay thank you um I will close the
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880 align:start position:0%

money in the governor's scholarship fund
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so that this did this work did not
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
come from me I was just a conduit
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
because it's now a house bill
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
yeah representa Aly I was under the
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
impression that most of us or all of us
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to get rid of the money going to
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship fund because
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional for one
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and we we ought to have the money
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
where it belongs in the education trust
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
fund we can't speak to that I I actually
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
have a note here that I I took during
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
the public hearing that with the words
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
delete um as as per what you're saying
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so that would be removing most of
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
line 22 and line 23 from
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
it oh if we struck the treasur so
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
deposit the unclaimed ticket and voucher
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
money in the governor scholarship fund
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
you you fine with the rest of
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
it and everybody else because I'll I'll
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
I'll ask okay
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
let's huh representative should be
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
specified the Ed education trust
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
fund I think it's automatic
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
representative um it I think it all
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
lottery money goes into the uh education
 
00:19:58.149 --> 00:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund as I understand it um if uh
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
director wants to speak to that that
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
would be fine and helpful I'm
 
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:10.510 align:start position:0%
would be fine and helpful I'm
sure

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
officer um well you want to speak John
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
oh I I sure I could speak speak to that
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
I know at the um there were numerous
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
questions at the public hearing
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
about um some inconsistencies within the
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
statutory language I know there's also
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
the discussion uh about the source of
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
where the funds would go to um we worked
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
with Senator Lang to try to clean up the
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
language as best we could um to make
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
sure everything was consistent um with
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
respect to uh the um obviously trying to
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
to effectuate what um Senator Lang was
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do in his original bill Senate
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
bill um we addressed we took out the
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
Lang language with regard to um RSA 28
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
the fund for RSA 284 21j um left in the
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
um the language regarding the governor's
 
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh scholarship fund um obviously that's
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
so what we were just trying to do is
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
clean up the language as Senator Lang
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
intended it coming out of the
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
Senate now to we oh sorry just sorry to
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
interrupt also at the uh public hearing
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion regarding uh the
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of moving the money to
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship fund we did
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
reach out to the Department of Justice
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
and I know they are currently working on
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
an opinion um on that issue
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
specifically uh wait a minute let me go
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
to representative spillsbury
 
00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:42.990 align:start position:0%
to representative spillsbury
first

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
you yeah I would concur with the
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
amendment provided that that last
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
sentence is removed and I also wanted to
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
ask so just to clarify what was said a
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
moment ago so does that then mean that
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
the sentence such monies shall become a
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
part of the special fund establish in
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
RSA 28 does that have to go back in what
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
does that specifically refer to yeah so
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it can certainly be put back
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
in that it specifies that it goes to the
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
education trust fund certainly in the
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
absence of any specific language uh any
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
revenues that would come to us would go
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund um so so it
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
merely clarifies what would otherwise be
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
true as a default matter correct
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative PL okay if we struck
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
that about going to the governor
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund won't give you
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
heartburn at
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
all we we don't make a decision on where
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
the money goes uh as as my boss likes to
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
say we we only make the money and then
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
we hand it over to you and uh it's up to
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
you to decide where it should go or your
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues down the
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
hall I didn't at least your colleagues
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
down the hall that in finance yeses Aly
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes um I believe this bill doesn't have
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
to come out until May
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
16th could we just wait for the
 
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
Justice if I could representative to
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
that to that point uh we did speak with
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
the assistant AG yesterday actually
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
about this and he said he's about three
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
quarters done so I'd imagine it would be
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
days not
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
weeks resident plat though I understand
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
the sentiment if you don't like it you
 
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
don't like it no matter what the AG says
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
and so if you don't like it let's get
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
rid of it
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
yeah good point uh yes representative
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I I support what
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative PL just said I think that
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh all
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
lottery funds after
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
expenses have flowed into the education
 
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund that's what you advertise
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's the expectation that's my
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
expectation our expectation I think and
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
it seemed seems to be quite clear to me
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
that that's what the Constitution
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
expects and so uh I don't I don't think
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
we need to wait and let's get you know
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's nice to get some things done and um
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
move moved out of out of our purview so
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is one opportunity for that
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg followed by
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
fellows yes a question for the director
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
um the the the definition Lottery of uh
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
tickets and things like this that was
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
established in what
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
1964 is that different than what
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
paramutual and uh what's the other term
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
here unclaimed tickets is that a
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
separate definition that that can go
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere else besides into the
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund well we certainly
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
looking at we'll give you the the
 
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
history of it obviously a lot sweep
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
Stakes commission was passed in 1963
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
implemented in ' 64 and it was a very
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
specific sweep Stakes
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
ticket we added a number of games those
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
all became traditional lottery tickets
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the 70s and 80s we added scratch
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
tickets we added Powerball in 1986 all
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
those were TR traditional lotteries and
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
then in 1990 was codified in the
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution the specific language that
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ames was referring to
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
regarding revenues of Lottery minus
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
expenses equals education trust fund
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
thereafter after the paramutual the
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
former paramutual commission which then
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
became the racing and child beginning
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
commission was merged with Lottery we
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
absorb them and so their
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
revenues is not defined by Lottery
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
traditionally as per history of the
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislation of the state and so that's
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
why we're asking an opinion not just for
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
this matter which is helpful but
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
certainly for going forward what is the
 
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
because that wasn't part of the of us in
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
1990 when the Constitutional amendment
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
was passed
 
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
was passed
represent

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you on the amendment I
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
just have a question about lines 8
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
through 11 that are crossed out now so
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
um for the the first part of it about
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
records currently it says records have
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
to be submitted to the lottery and
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's crossed out did you cross that
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
out because you don't want the that or
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
that that is true that's we're trying
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
simplify the process so this
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
is currently the process is that we
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
receive books and records of uncleaned
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
vouchers and then we hold them on our
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
books for a prolonged period of time uh
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
for people to to be able to come and
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
reimburse them this is to streamline
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
this to set a set time period where
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
people can get reimbursed at the
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
property um and then just essentially
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
send the check over to us rather than
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
have us be a part of the reimbursement
 
00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.990 align:start position:0%
have us be a part of the reimbursement
process

00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
just follow up follow up
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
so um I would think that this might play
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of role in ensuring that they
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
send you all the money that you should
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
be getting or you have how are you going
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
to know that we still have several other
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
um statutory authorities to be able to
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
audit those funds and those books in
 
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
order to ensure that we're getting full
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
amount um so they don't actually need to
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
produce those over to us um we have
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
other other powers that allow us to
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're getting everything
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
to yes represent
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair so when we
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
get to Executive to the executive
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
session would it be or should I wait
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
till then to ask I'm just wondering from
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
a procedural perspective that if we
 
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
don't like that last sentence on lines
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
2020 22 and 23 in the amendment can we
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
just uh amend the amendment to remove
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
that line no uh we we were
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
representative PL has made a request to
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
get a new um Amendment drafted and we
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be able to get that it
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
will be in time for us to exec all right
 
00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:14.789 align:start position:0%
will be in time for us to exec all right
thank

00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
you in
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
theory Mr yes representative Southworth
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
um so just point of order do you need a
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
straw vote to say that let's we want uh
 
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
represent PL to do that or are we all
 
00:28:27.399 --> 00:28:28.830 align:start position:0%
represent PL to do that or are we all
set

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I think we're all set do you have an
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
objection it sounds like the best idea
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative PL did
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
it wow thank
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:42.039 align:start position:0%
right representative spilburg yeah just
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
to clarify um if we are dropping the
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
sentence on line 22 and 23 aren't we
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
also reinstating the sentence on line 10
 
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:57.029 align:start position:0%
also reinstating the sentence on line 10
and

00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:01.470 align:start position:0%
 
11

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know um so well we can ask
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
her witness again but I I believe that's
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
what I heard such money shall become a
 
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
part of the special fund established in
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 28421 J I don't have um the ability
 
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
to look up that citation right now but
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's what we want Mr coni
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
or that's that is the education trust
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
fund that's the the account that holds
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
over to educ trust and if I recall
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
correctly representative this language
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
was added when racing was merged with us
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
so it make clear where the Fone month's
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
funds would go because they weren't
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
originally part of Lottery that's
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
probably so given that history I think
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
clarify okay representative PL I have a
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
concern with cross referencing of
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
rsas if RSA
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
28 for for 21j exists that's where it's
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
going whether or not this Rec this
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
it well I think it's a fine point but
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
given the history and the fact that this
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
activity was not originally part of the
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission when the
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
Constitutional amendment was uh adopted
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
I just think that this is uh it removes
 
00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:18.630 align:start position:0%
I just think that this is uh it removes
all

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
doubt so yeah um okay yes represent
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
fellas I'm unclear about this discussion
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
I thought I assumed that the 20 28 4 21
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
is the governor's scholarship fund no
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's not the it's not the trust fund the
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
TR I um it it's not the trust fund it is
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
the fund that the the treasurer holds
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
for lottery funds uh in order to hold
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
that that's where our funds sit and our
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
expenses get paid out of the Overflow
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
from that that account then goes into
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't take that out so you would
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
recommend that that come back in I if if
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
the intent of the committee is to ensure
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
that the money is going to flow as all
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
lottery monies flow it certainly would
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
be um I I would guess advisable to put
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
that back
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
lle so my understanding of what we're
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
to we've cut the books or records of
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
said person we're going
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
to leave that sentence out yes because
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want them to have to deal with
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
the records but the second sentence that
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
says such monies shall become a part of
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
the special fund established in RSA
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
right we're going to keep that sentence
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
right got it okay yeah representative PL
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
perfect thank
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
you okay we all good all right thank you
 
00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:15.750 align:start position:0%

25th so we have we have plenty of time
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
but I want to make note of that there's
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
no reason to delay if we know what we
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
want to do with it representative Aly Mr
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm I would
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
like to have the little bit of time that
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
we've got until then in terms of
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
revenues to try to see what
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
is actually happening to the business
 
00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:05.110 align:start position:0%
is actually happening to the business
profit

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
tax okay uh representative spillsbury
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to what committee will this
 
00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:14.190 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to what committee will this
go

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
Finance

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
definitely and it we're being told that
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
it is because of the extra refunds the
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
extra refunds are above
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
by that amount what the Dr thought they
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
would be this
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
year and we'd set it up thinking that
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay most of those refunds aren't going
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
to start hitting us for a while so that
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
we can adapt to
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
it and I don't know how much that is I'd
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
like to get the Dr in here to talk to us
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
about that and whatever else is going on
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
with the business profits
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
tax maybe we can get a yes
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury yeah this is
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
454 right yes so this deals with the
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
allocation of real estate transfer taxes
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm missing what the connection is
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
refunds well BPT I think uh changing
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
going from five million to 10 million I
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
think well represent Al me I'll let you
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
it half of about half of that money
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
comes out of the general fund and about
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
half of that money comes out of the
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
ETF and finance The Well Finance could
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
next year if we're in TR real
 
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.190 align:start position:0%
next year if we're in TR real
trouble

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
um uh in the budget uh undo this but
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's the only way they could could uh
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
handle if they need that five
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
million or other things that are just as
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
important I'm just not getting the
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
connection what refunds into the
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
business profit tax have to do with the
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
tax M sorry the business profits tax uh
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
and the business Enterprise tax uh that
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in the
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
um the statements about how much tax
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
money is coming in
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
on are the business profits tax is sh
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
showing a
 
00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.230 align:start position:0%
showing a
considerable

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
considerable
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
refunds

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it's but when the
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
Dr figured out what we thought we'd be
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
getting this year and they included what
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
they thought the refunds would be under
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
the new system that we had developed two
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
terms ago to try to cut down the excess
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
money sitting there that we that they
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
could the businesses could take at any
 
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
time and they're saying that this is due
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
to the refunds but it's excess refunds
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
above what our
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
um our estimates had been in the
 
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
um our estimates had been in the
budget

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative leapley followed by
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
PL thank you Mr chair um I just wanted
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
to confirm that that this time would be
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to ask a question to
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
Dr are we in work session on this bill
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we we can uh let me go to we'll do
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
that shortly okay thank you go to
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
representative PL I think the
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
relation representative alme still
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
didn't hit it but the relation is
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
overall taxes and uh it I keep track of
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
whether we're Surplus or negative and
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
all that overall taxes we hit a high of
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
about $106 million since then in March
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
less uh we we've had a hit and it's been
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
negative in March and I think overall
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're about 50 5 somewhere in the $56
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
million range Surplus which could
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
continue to disappear and the concern is
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
if we're taking an extra 5 million uh
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
and putting it into uh from Real Estate
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
transfer tax into a special fund does
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
that leave enough money elsewhere to
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
fund state government and
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
so that's a general relation if it's
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
just a a matter of observing about
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
overall you shortages and concerns I
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
concur yeah I don't think this bill is
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
wise and and uh especially since the uh
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
let's is that what in fact you were
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
trying to drive
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
at are you talking about representative
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
Aly yes representative Aly please um
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
am I interpreting you correctly yes I am
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
am worried that if we put it in the
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
special fund then the finance
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
committee can undo it in the budget but
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a last minute when people
 
00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079 align:start position:0%
have been expecting to have it um that
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
doing and if things are
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
okay there will probably be a lot of
 
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.910 align:start position:0%
okay there will probably be a lot of
interest

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
in on in put giving them that five
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
million yes and I think this was similar
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
to according to the notes I took similar
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
to our concerns during the public
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
hearing and
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
um you know s similar conclusion uh
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so I would just
 
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
like to add to that my I I have have the
 
00:39:50.359 --> 00:39:51.230 align:start position:0%
like to add to that my I I have have the
same

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
concern um about you know reducing
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
what's available in the general fund and
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
also the education trust fund but in
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
addition to that I would just like to
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
add that putting the first5 million into
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund was only done in
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
20120 so you know takes a while for
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
things to get started we don't even know
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
what kind of impact that's having so I
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
think it would be prudent if we're going
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
to start putting $10 million into a fund
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
that we really want to hear exactly what
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
what benefit uh that has right
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth uh thank you
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
um for clarification um representative
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
alme are you thinking we should wait
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps till like the second week of
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
April or something we'll have more
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
information by
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
then I'm just wondering about the
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
timeline yeah well the latest we could
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
wait would be the third week in April
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
that's to really tight to the 25th on
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
well no we have to have it out of here
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
on the 25th that's right um that is
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
really not an I mean as I mean we are
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
fairly far be we're some 26 million or
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
so behind on the business profits tax
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
right now but in the next 5 days it
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened in the past but in the
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
next 5 days it could my God could mostly
 
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.990 align:start position:0%
next 5 days it could my God could mostly
disappear

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
and the same thing would be happening in
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
April uh so we won't we I think we're
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
talking about having a revenue
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
reestimate in May but uh and that's
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
really the first time we can be fairly
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
sure what's going on
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I would I would agree I think
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
two weeks uh is probably not going to
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
make that much of a difference in terms
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
of figuring that out um I know there's a
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
lot of questions let me invite Dr up um
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:10.839 align:start position:0%
up Mr chair yes R just for our
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
scheduling the 15th is the Monday and of
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the first week or the
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
third week in April so we have the
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
entire rest of that week and Dr should
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
have um a pretty good idea of what
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
they're because 15th is a deadline for
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
their filing so we've got four days
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
anyway in in the third week and the 25th
 
00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:39.309 align:start position:0%
anyway in in the third week and the 25th
is

00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
then uh the Thursday of the next week I
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
mean my I I understand that my my
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
um you know that that isn't going to
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
make a trend if we see some sort of
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
trend now I'm not sure that one more uh
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
point is going to give us enough to
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
decide one way or the other my sense is
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
no matter what whether we wait we're
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
still going to probably reach the same
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion but let's ask Dr how we're
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
doing um with our revenues right now hi
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Lauren o solivan
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
I'm the senior Financial Analyst at the
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
Dr I'm Wendy mtiv you're a financial
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
analyst at
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
Dr and we're here to answer any
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
questions so um I was following along
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
with the conversation but is there a
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
specific specific question that I'll do
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
answer well I guess the the question
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
first question would just be I'll ask
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
the first question and then we can go
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
from there would be um how are how are
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
revenues tracking at this point okay so
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
what I have in front of me right now is
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
today's um Cash basis revenue report
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
which is reporting revenues received to
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
business days ago so this is through
 
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.670 align:start position:0%
business days ago so this is through
March

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
March
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
22nd and right now what we're looking at
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the business taxes um month to date
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
are $35 million uh below the prior year
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
and $39 million below plan as of as of
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
that day um what's due this month are
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
the partnership returns and extension so
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
the majority of our filers they're not
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
due until April 15th so um we were
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
looking at some of those transactions
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
and it's a Confluence of different
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
things some of it they haven't filed yet
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
some of it these were one time tax
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
notices some of it uh they may be paid a
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
little bit less so it's it's a hodge
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
podge um the refunds are actually very
 
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:41.079 align:start position:0%
similar to last March and um and we
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
still have one more we have more refunds
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
coming out tomorrow and that will be the
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
last for this month so we'll have a
 
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
better sense how much of that is related
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
to the um credit carryovers but one
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
thing that um we've had noticed over the
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
course of the Year about half of those
 
00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.589 align:start position:0%
course of the Year about half of those
refunds

00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
we can attribute to the 500% cap being
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
in effect for um those credit carry
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
forwards well we notice a lot of many of
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
those uh taxpayers when they are taking
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
those refunds are taking more refund
 
00:45:13.079 --> 00:45:14.990 align:start position:0%
those refunds are taking more refund
than

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
um um how do I say this they could leave
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
up to 500% but they're taking more than
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
that so they're so they're leaving maybe
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
less than 100% of their liability as
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
credit on account who are only leaving
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
500% on account tend to be our smaller
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers where they're where 500% of
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
their liability is less than $1,000 but
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
some of the bigger taxpayers are you
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
know so then when the 250 kicks in they
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
don't have that money sing on account it
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
came out essentially in the timeline a
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
little bit earlier than perhaps expected
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
okay is it fair to say that um two
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
numbers you mentioned was 22 million
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
below um last year uh that was um so
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's so for the month it's 35.7 below
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
and year to date it's 26.7 below okay
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
but the the year-to date month um
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean as much right now correct
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
because uh the majority of our taxpayers
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
will um their due date is April 15th
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay so this is just the Partnerships
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
all right represent
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
so the under
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
500% are not reacting yet which is what
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
react on that well what it is if it's
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
below the 500% way they're taking a
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
refund um we we don't necessarily know
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
why someone would take a refund except
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
that I can tell you're well if you
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
didn't take a refund you're at the it's
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
because you're at the 500% you had to
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
take something yeah and what I know like
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
well if they only left 500% on account
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
it would be this much but they're taking
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
more than that so they're actually
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
taking those refunds sooner then perhaps
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
instead of keep instead of keeping more
 
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
of it on account to um take away from
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
future liability lowering those
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
estimates follow up so
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
for on what we did was draw their
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
attention to the fact that they had all
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
this money sitting here that they' never
 
00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:27.750 align:start position:0%
this money sitting here that they' never
taken

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
taken
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
when we thought they'd just shave it
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
down that I I couldn't tell you exactly
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
what the motivation is I know there's
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
two ways you can they can request the
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
refund and if you don't request the
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
refund we will automatically if you're
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
at the 500% automatically refund you
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
that amount or we'll give you so many
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
days to make a decision through letters
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
and if you don't respond to the letter
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
then you will get a refund so there's
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
also that happening in the back um as
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
part of our processes to that is forcing
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
some of those refunds out of the
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
door but followup what we would have
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
been expecting when we were doing the
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates two years ago on would
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
have been that the 500
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
percenters on that we refunded would go
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
down to
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
300% with the
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
refund if you were just sending it back
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
to them you wouldn't send them the whole
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
top I would have to look into I I wasn't
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
here for when that was done so I'd have
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
to see if that was the thought process
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
at the time yeah and we don't really
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
know what the thought process they went
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
through was either so I do know we do
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
have processes in place that if you do
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
not request the refund or fill out that
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
part of the form and you're do a refund
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
you are given the opportunity to leave a
 
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
credit but if if you do not respond to
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
the letters we will issue the refund and
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
that is a pol and that is actually a
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
policy decision that was made so that's
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
also impacting that that's outside of
 
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
the CCL thank
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
you do you know what the time frame for
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
I think the next step down was um
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
250% or is it three I think it's tax
 
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
here 25 to
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
250 okay do you know oh in 25 in for for
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
tax year 25 so 25 okay so that would
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
probably be due in like
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
I don't have that in front of me I
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
didn't come prepared to talk about
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
business taxes today so I don't have
 
00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
that information in front of me so I if
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
I we can send you that information as a
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
reminder of how that phase out yeah that
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
I mean that's more affecting us in the
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
future yeah uh representative PL and
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
then spillsbury yes I I can't remember
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
the bill number we had a house bill
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
earlier this year we had that this tax
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
cut that tax cut another tax cut all all
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
in one big uh wrapped up in a big red
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
bow and we decided with that that uh uh
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
individually those tax cuts may have
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
Merit in the future might but we have to
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
have a a revenue we'd have to have a a a
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
a revenue year a budget year uh so we
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
could take an overall look at revenues
 
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
before we decided anything and I I see
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
this as the same thing I I like the
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
sentiment of increasing another $5
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
million I like the sentiment into the uh
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
affordable housing but I just think the
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
timing is wrong we we our revenues are
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
not extremely robust for year to date
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
overall they're still a positive uh even
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
though but but despite the business
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
profit tax but not by a huge amount and
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
expect that we just don't have a it's
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
not robust enough for me to feel
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing anything till next
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
year and so I'm going to suggest interim
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
study yeah and I would also add to that
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
that until we see those April returns
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
and extension come in it's really hard
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
to gauge even even for the interest in
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
dividends tax that's when the bulk of
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
the revenue comes
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
in okay uh representative spelsbury
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
followed by leapley followed by Ames
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I to refocus on
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
what specifically SB 454 proposes I'd
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
like to make two
 
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
observations number one no tax revenue
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
Source has taken a deeper hit in this uh
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year um uh as real estate
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
transfer tax it's not close and my sense
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
of the market given the sustained High
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
mortgage interest rates is that it's not
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
about to recover uh anytime very soon my
 
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.549 align:start position:0%
about to recover uh anytime very soon my
second

00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
observation is that the effective date
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
proposed here is July 1st 2025 so I
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
would just itl this bill and uh see
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
year

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr chair I have two
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions and then um two
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
observations my first
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
question deals with the I'm looking at
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
the monthly preliminary reports that we
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
get just because I want to ask a couple
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
questions about Rett to make sure I
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
understand okay um so I'm looking at the
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax um month to dat
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
the plan and then the difference MH and
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
there there there's the general fund
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
column there's the education fund column
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
and then there's a Jen and Ed together
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
column so is is does half of R go to the
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
general and half go thir a third goes to
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay and so a third to education trust
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
fund and twoth thirds to the general
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
fund yes and this bill just says from RE
 
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.069 align:start position:0%
fund yes and this bill just says from RE
Vue

00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
Vue
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
collected so the way that uh it
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
currently works that 5 million comes out
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
of the general fund portion so that's
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
where the transfer occurs on the current
 
00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
on the five million right
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
now so um my expectation is that if
 
00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:14.839 align:start position:0%
we're increasing the amount and nothing
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
else changes it would still come from
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
the same place that's where the transfer
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
would occur I'd have to look behind the
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
scenes if there's any back calculations
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
because once we put something in the
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund we generally don't
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
take the money out to we hold it in
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
trust for
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
Education yeah we like what if we put
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
into too much we leave it there okay
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's not for housing it's for Education
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
um the other question I had is just to
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm reading this right so when
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
I look at the r for the general fund it
 
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
receipts so yeah that's receipts um net
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
of refunds that's the 9462 number you're
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
looking at I mine says
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
9.5 um and then the next it says plan
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
7.0 so for this month for this
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
fund it's ask which which one this is
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
the thing I got in the email that we
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
get oh is that the one from Department
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
of admin
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
Services uh yes ah okay so maybe it's
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
less precise than yours I'm not worried
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
about like Point whatever I just want to
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand so it looks to me
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
I'll say what I understand you correct
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
me so it looks like real estate transfer
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
tax month to date 9.5 million the plan
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
was 7.0 I'm talking about the Gen oh
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
okay fund so that's 2.5 million
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
over just for that month right and then
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
if I look across over to the education
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
fund it says um 3.4
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess there's not really a month
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
to date because you're transferring it
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
from the other account that so that's
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
correct so what you're seeing um those
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
transfers to the education trust fund
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
occur on the last business day of the
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
month so essentially if you want to
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
think about all the money stops in the
 
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
general fund first and then it's
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
calculated what goes to the education
 
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
trust fund and this is true for all
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
taxes except for utility property tax
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
which 100% goes to the education trust
 
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
fund and then at the end of the month
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
the amounts that belong to education
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
trust fund then we uh do a general
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
ledger entry to move that so what you're
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
looking at now on your month to date
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're probably seeing a zero for the
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that does that
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund piece is in the 9.5
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
million so if you take a third of that
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's what as of today that's what
 
00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:47.079 align:start position:0%
would go to the education trust fund so
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
now I want to back out because I just
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
had the monthly numbers and so it was
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
helpful for me to understand so to back
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
out I'm wondering um what where I
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
received re for R last year as opposed
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
to this year like just total receipts
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
for the year oh for the whole year so
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
for Rett was um 200 so this is net of
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund transfer so
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
29.2 million and then just add back five
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
million to that that was 20 that was
 
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.069 align:start position:0%
million to that that was 20 that was
2023

00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
and the on a cash basis so that may not
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
and year to date for this year I guess
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
that is year to date for this year so
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
year to date this year and so that's
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
through March 22nd is 140.6 million and
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
at this time last year it was 168.3
 
00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
Million okay um so the reason I ask all
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
of this you have one more one more
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
question I want to get
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
other so I just um so I've been asking
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
questions of Dr and this is a work
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
session and others have given their
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
takeaways and what we should do with
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
this bill so I'm going to give my
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
takeaway now that I've gotten the
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
information I needed um so if I
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
understand correctly when this was
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
established in 2020 it was $5
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
million if we adjust for inflation
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
only right if we were giving them
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
exactly the same amount of dollars today
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
it would be6 million so what we're
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
talking about is $4
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
million and I understand you rais a good
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
point about tax cuts and should hold off
 
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
tax cuts are like a huge unknown right
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know how much revenue we're
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
giving up with a tax cut with this bill
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about basically in real
 
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
money $4 million that's a very small
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
amount when we talk about the New
 
00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.910 align:start position:0%
amount when we talk about the New
Hampshire

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
budget hi hi um so we're talking about
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
homelessness right this is a solution
 
00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.630 align:start position:0%
homelessness right this is a solution
for

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
homelessness which is linked with
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
joblessness which when we have homeless
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
people in the state it's very expensive
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
because they need other
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
services not only do they need other
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
services they're often not going to work
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
so their employers and they themselves
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
are paying less taxes so I think we're
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about the problem backwards
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking ourselves if we have enough
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
money to pay for this expense and I
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
think we should be asking ourselves the
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
opposite question do we want Revenue in
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
the future if so we should make this $4
 
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
million investment today in building
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
houses in the state that are affordable
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
so let's just be real clear on what
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we're talking about
 
00:58:38.039 --> 00:58:39.109 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we're talking about
$5

00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
$5
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
million thank you okay
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
um representative a wait a minute Ames
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
you no but he had his hand raised
 
00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.829 align:start position:0%
you no but he had his hand raised
before

00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah much at the line of thinking
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
that I I've been following is uh was
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
captured by representative Le's line of
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
questions so um I I just wanted to say
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
that uh in terms of the timing for this
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill this is the time for this bill
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
because um the housing need is urgent
 
00:59:23.549 --> 00:59:23.559 align:start position:0%
and uh this is a program that from a
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
policy perspective the house has
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
embraced and uh um the implementers of H
 
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.349 align:start position:0%
embraced and uh um the implementers of H
housing

00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
policy uh the people who are on the
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
ground trying to get to a better place
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
with our afford particularly our
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
affordable housing um say that this is a
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill that will help uh move the needle
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
on that and uh and we need to move that
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
needle as soon as possible and that will
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
in turn um likely help with our economy
 
00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
e and help with our revenues and in
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
terms of delay um you know I'm I'm okay
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
with uh slowing down a little bit to see
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
what more we can see but I've been
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
through this for many years and um is
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
there's always uncertainty and always uh
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh ups and downs in the various taxes
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
that are imponderable you can't figure
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
it out uh April's a big Revenue month
 
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
historically for um interest dividends
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
well that's a smaller tax now and uh for
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
um the business taxes uh but a lot comes
 
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
in after that so you still got a big
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
question mark about what's going to be
 
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
there for the year and um and so uh
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be better informed true if we wait
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit but uh we won't be fully
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
informed we it will still be a guessing
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
game um an educated guessing game that's
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
what it is and we'll all be uh uh
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
steered in our guessing by our own um
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
policy preferences I'm sure uh like it
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
or not we're not totally objective and
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll come we'll be a little
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
better informed I'll say that and uh
 
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll that will uh lead to a a
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
better decision but for myself I'm ready
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
to go on this thing and uh
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
um but I want to get a good vote that
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
everybody's comfortable with so I'd be
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay with delaying uh in order to get
 
01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:36.589 align:start position:0%
okay with delaying uh in order to get
better

01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
information representative ORS thank you
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so some thoughts on this having
 
01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
done this my whole life first of all $5
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
million is a drop in the bucket second
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
of all I agree with representative
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
leapley if you want to have a housing in
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
the future affordable housing when we
 
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
have a housing crisis then why don't we
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
do it either way I really don't care you
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
know let's get on with it either pass it
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
or kill it I mean Jeepers this isn't
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
that difficult thank
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you
 
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
on I would not agree with itl because
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
interim study would allow the Senate on
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
towards uh after we have been able to
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
finish with the money items the Senate
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
to think which of their many priorities
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
they have apparently sent to the house
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
that on are going to reduce our our
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
rainy day uh not our rainy day fund but
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
the money that we can access our Surplus
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
to near Zero by the end of this term
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
um on and
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
on and I I do
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
I do not know where housing stands
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
within all of the things that they're
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get money
 
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
for on but
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
on if we did have is they would
 
01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
presumably not engage in deficit
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
spending over there and they would have
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
to make up their minds whether they're
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
going to put this as an amendment onto a
 
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill and send it back to us that would
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
point I would very happily vote for it
 
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.549 align:start position:0%
point I would very happily vote for it
but

01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
um okay I'm just worried
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
about where we'll be next year if we
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
have almost no Surplus from this year
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative PL I sometimes have
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
cognitive dissonance and so I
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
recommended interim study I could also
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
see given some of the
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
discussion passing it but uh with the
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
idea that the finance committee will
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
take another shot at it and so if they
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
don't think the money is there uh they
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
can do something different with it I
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
could go either way well my
 
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is ways and
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
means we're we're charged with making
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
sure that we believe the money is there
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
Finance um needs to finance decides of
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
the money that's potentially there how
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
should it be distributed so um we we do
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
have um we should make sure that we feel
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh comfortable with the best way to move
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
forward as opposed to having another
 
01:04:32.829 --> 01:04:32.839 align:start position:0%
committee decide that representative
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chair so my question is
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if you
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
had to give us a swag as to where
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
revenues going in the future April May
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
June could you give us what your swag is
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
I can Define swag if you need it yeah I
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
would like that to find okay very
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
this is is re really tough to say
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
because I see because I'm seeing
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
surprises so it's hard to gauge is this
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
a oneoff am I seeing delay you know
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
something maybe didn't come in this
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
month but it's going to come in next
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
month I am seeing and I think I said
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
this in the testimony um during the
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing I'm feeling a little bit
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
more positive about Rett this is the uh
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
first this is like one of the first
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
months I've seen all fiscal year where
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
rent is actually growing I'm seeing the
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
transactions growing and while it's
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
currently a million under plan that's
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
probably the closest to plan we've been
 
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
all year and and that's where I so I'm
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
feeling more positive I'm not suggesting
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
though that we're going to have this big
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
recovery but I feel like we're we're
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
past the uh bottom but that's my own
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
personal opinion uh on that and um but
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
right now until I really see how this
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
month closes and and um it's really hard
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
to gauge what's happening right now with
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
the business taxes though indd has been
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
surprisingly strong this year too we I
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
had expected to see it come down now
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
that the rate was at 4% what they're
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
filing so I have to look at the
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
composition of who if this is um just
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
more people are filing that there's some
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
you know they people are doing well MH
 
01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:23.799 align:start position:0%
so that that's so I I feel like it's a
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
mi I guess summarize that it's a mixed
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
bag okay thank you quick followup and so
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
do you believe that as we've cut taxes
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
revenues have stayed the same gone up or
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
down that's hard to gauge because there
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
were other things that were also
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
impacting it's not just the rate cut it
 
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
was moving to um to the single sales
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
factor it's going into the um you know
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
moving away from like the market Source
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
um way of attributing um what's taxable
 
01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
income on some of those tax and that's
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
um some of those are very hard to
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
quantify if that was the motivation if
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
you look at it year-over-year the only
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
one that you can really look at as maybe
 
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor okay thank you yeah
 
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
representative duet yeah just real
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
briefly I I agree with uh representative
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
Aly and if there's ever been a a piece
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
of legislation that deserves an interim
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
study look it's this one right here
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
we're playing a game of days and weeks
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
in figures let's let's have the figures
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
come back and if if it is in fact a
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
priority for the other side of the wall
 
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
and we all agree that housing is a
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
priority let's not be hasteful in what
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
we do to make a deadline that we have to
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
make by by rule let's IAS this and and
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
do the right thing at the right
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
time okay I'm going to uh end the work
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:10.150 align:start position:0%
 
454

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
197 okay I'm going to open the work
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
497 and do we have a we have an
 
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.430 align:start position:0%
497 and do we have a we have an
amendment

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
so is it passed out or it's a very small
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I did I did oh here it is
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
if you don't have it representative D
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
haven't uh would you like to speak to
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment represent the amendment
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
changes

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
on completion of the federally acire
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
required disproportionate share with
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
compliance with the federally required
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
disourage here and we owe this one I
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
think to representative
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
Ames but I said I'd get the amendment
 
01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.910 align:start position:0%
Ames but I said I'd get the amendment
but

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
um okay I do I think understand
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share more than anyone
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
on this side of the
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
room most
 
01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
likely okay uh any other comment on this
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment fully replaces
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
does it not representative Aly or is it
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
a u the amendment or is it a section I'm
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
sorry section five yeah it's only
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
Section Five Section Five right the rest
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
of it stays the way it is yep makes
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
sense and that was the recommendation I
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
think during the public hearing as well
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
so that yeah is good any other comments
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative PL I'm sorry I don't
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on what what's
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment do uh so look at line
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
8 okay line eight used to say well line
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
eight of the amendment if you look at
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
line 15 of the bill line 15 of the bill
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
says comp uh the fourth word in
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
completion of so we're changing
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
completion of to line eight on the
 
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
amendment says compliance with so just
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
one it wasn't correct to say say
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
completion of it's compliance with
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's why that that's been changed any
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
comments okay seeing none I'm going to
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
497

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
o all right I'm going to open the work
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%

amendment
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
sooner well I'm I'm
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
passing my Amendment

01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
representative fellows do we already
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
yours you're you're do you have the
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment your Amendment oh oh yeah pass

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
please and then there
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
was okay and there was something else
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
that you had printed out right that you
 
01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
showed me that document did you get
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
copies of
 
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
knows representative fellows do you also
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
you so both of the Amendments that
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
you're looking at ref yeah hold hold on
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.110 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.040 --> 01:14:24.030 align:start position:0%
 
definitely

01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:40.270 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
okay I think everybody has uh all the
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
handouts you should have two different
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
amendments and then
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
um there's also just a third information
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
sheet that representative fellows um
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
passed out um let me first say that um
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.679 --> 01:15:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I received wording from Michael Haley
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
um his concern when he testified was
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
that um churches needed to be added to
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
the mix and so he um he rewarded this
 
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
and uh that so my my my Amendment
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
basically fixes that issue of uh making
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
sure that the churches were added to the
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
Charities uh so let's first look at that
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
one representative Aly yes it looks like
 
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
what represent fellow is passed out
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
as as
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
background is pretty much the same as
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
all right um any other comments on my
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
amendment of that order we'll go
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative fellows yeah so
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I I don't
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
remember that somebody told us that
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
churches should be in here I yes yeah
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
trusts anyway so that was not my focus
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
what I was working on my Amendment
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
focused on um the sentence that if you
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
um the Senate the the amendment that we
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
got from the
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
Senate the sentence that was on
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
lines for the first sentence of
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
2A and my concern with that was on line
 
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
five the way it was worded it sounded as
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
if the charity
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
organization needed a license and this
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
is not about they're as far as I know
 
01:17:04.629 --> 01:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
they don't need any kind of License to
 
01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
have an auction and this section of RSA
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we're working on is under the um
 
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:13.790 align:start position:0%
that we're working on is under the um
the

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
oplc the licensing organization for the
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
state and that this is a section about
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh this is this it's this is in the
 
01:17:24.199 --> 01:17:26.229 align:start position:0%
uh this is this it's this is in the
auctioneer

01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
auctioneer
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
um description of what somebody needs to
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
do to get a license to be an Auctioneer
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
and this
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
particular part of that that's being
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
amended the um 31b colon 13 is an a
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
section titled
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions so so the paragraph that
 
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.229 align:start position:0%
exemptions so so the paragraph that
exists

01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
before this the the paragraph two not
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
2A um refers what what it says there is
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
that members of the
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
organization don't need a license to be
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
an Auctioneer and to hold a charity
 
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
auction provided they have to be members
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
of that organization and they can they
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
um can't be members only for the purpose
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
of holding an auction so this particular
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 a the language in that
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much mirrors the language in a
 
01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
the difference is that this is new this
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
is being added and this is trying to say
 
01:18:41.239 --> 01:18:42.750 align:start position:0%
is being added and this is trying to say
that

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
um a person can be hired doesn't have to
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
be a member they can be hired to be an
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
an Auctioneer but it limits the normal
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
function of an Auctioneer pretty much to
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
just standing up there and say you know
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
who bids this who you know what kind of
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
bid can I get from you and not handling
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
the money and the custody of the
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
property and liability for what's you
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
know presented all of that stuff so that
 
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
makes sense um I was just trying to make
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
the correction that the organization
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't need a
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
license um it's it's not a that it's a
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
question of the auctioneer doesn't need
 
01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
a license but as we got more into this
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
then turns out that the reference to RSA
 
01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.910 align:start position:0%
then turns out that the reference to RSA
721

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
721
 
01:19:45.149 --> 01:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
2B it says so all of these organ
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
organizations have to be um eligible
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
under RSA 721 2B which if you look at it
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
um which is part of what um the GPT
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
thing is going to help you with is they
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
have to be a church or a re a religious
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
organization and talks about being a
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
denomination so you you know an
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
educational institution isn't going to
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
qualify as
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
that in addition if we're supposed to
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
need um the in
 
01:20:25.629 --> 01:20:25.639 align:start position:0%
um if we need to
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
reference not just 721 2B if we need to
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
also U reference the USC statute which
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
which is also about churches and as far
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
as I could see they look pretty much
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
referring to the same thing then that
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
also needs to happen in the paragraph
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
above so you know what's going on here
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
so that's my my concern about this is
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
is not ready for prime time and needs to
 
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
go back and clarify exactly who this is
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair I tend to
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
agree with representative fellows uh it
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't include several large charitable
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
organizations uh such as uh the Masons
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
the Lions the Kanas the uh
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
um elk the
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
Moose um Knights of Columbus um which
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
are all different
 
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:35.470 align:start position:0%
are all different
501c

01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
organizations okay uh yeah just to
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
clarify 501c there are lots and lots of
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
different kind kinds of
 
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.950 align:start position:0%
different kind kinds of
501

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
501
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
three 501 C 501 3 there are less 501 see
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
yes and then the rest of it breaks it
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
down to many other categories some of
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
which are are Charities
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
5013c qualify as Charities the only one
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
that qualifies and the other ones are
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
all those other things so I I don't know
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
maybe if we had just 5013c in here that
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
would take care of it but I'm not I'm
 
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
it's too confusing and that's why I
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
think it needs to get fixed yes and and
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
that was my point because these other
 
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
organizations under New Hampshire law
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
are considered Charities because they do
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law doesn't follow federal
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
law and it says that they're they do
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
charitable work uh and these other
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
organizations will often times run a
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
charity raffle a charity auction to
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
raise funds for the works that they do
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
so the the the issue is this needs some
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
additional work to make sure sure that
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
those Charities that operate and even
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
excluded um what on line eight actually
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
see okay no I'll take that back repr um
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
represen in PL what's confusing to me
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
with the Senate
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
construction is that it's still not
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
clear to me uh that it's the individual
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have to hold a license you
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
could read that either the individual or
 
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
the charitable organization or a
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
religious organization so I would change
 
01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.750 align:start position:0%
religious organization so I would change
the

01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
wording for that by putting a period on
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
Line2 for that organization put a period
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
say the individual does not have to hold
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
a license period so it's clear that it's
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
the individual that doesn't have to hold
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
the license rather than the charity and
 
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh represent ol's point
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
I I think our definition our our state
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
laws RSA 721 cover all those
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
to or should I come
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:31.750 align:start position:0%
to or should I come
back

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I I basically I think we are going to
 
01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
need to take a little more time to sort
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
this out and it's just a drafting issue
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
I I don't think this is as complicated
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
as it's become um my sense
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
is for one thing I I'll start with uh
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
this paper that uh representative
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
fellow's handed out that has on it this
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's this chat CPT
 
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
3.5 and then there's an explanation of
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
the key elements of RSA 721
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
2B but that's just a partial statement
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
of what's in RSA
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
721 um so that uh if you look at 721
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's quite broad now I can't say for
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
sure the question it's going to be asked
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
about Masons and Elks and and so forth I
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
don't know I haven't had time to look at
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
it but uh um I kind of like I guess if I
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
looking at these three options as
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
drafted and uh and then uh
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative janigian and
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I like the
 
01:25:43.229 --> 01:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
structure in uh in representative
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
janigian which was drafted I take it by
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
the attorney general in the teral trust
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
or at least it was it has his Blessing
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
right um and and uh it starts out with
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
an or an organization meeting the
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
definition of a charitable organization
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
da or the definition of a church da da
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
da may may engage an individual not
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
covered in paragraph two of this section
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is uh the section that deals with
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
licensing for
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
auctioneers uh May so so these
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
organizations that are charitable or
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
churches May engage an individual
 
01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh who is not covered in paragraph two
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
of this section in other words not a
 
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
licensed Auctioneer to perform charity
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
auctions for that organization without
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
holding a license to me that's pretty
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
clear and um we just have to double
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
check and make sure that these
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
references are sufficiently
 
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive so that we're not leaving
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
out inadvertently some subgroup that
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
should be in there well let me ask
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
represent excuse me representative
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
spillsbury thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
concur with uh what representative Ames
 
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
has just said I have no problem at all
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
with what the bill wants to do but I
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
think that the phrasing is
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
ambiguous I think I personally need to
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
look at the citations and read the
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
language more carefully before I'm
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
satisfied or
 
01:27:17.159 --> 01:27:19.430 align:start position:0%
satisfied or
comfortable

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
particularly I think you can read these
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
three different versions and come down
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
uncertain whether the purpose is to
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
allow an unlicensed charitable
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
organization to hire a licensed
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer or second to allow an
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
organization to have its members be
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
unlicensed in this process
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
or to have an unlicensed Auctioneer now
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
my impression when we listened to
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
testimony in the hearing was we're not
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
talking about un unlicensed auctioneers
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an organization able
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
to hire an Auctioneer without the
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
organization needing a license so that
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
specific intent as to those three
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
possible interpretations needs to be
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
clarified and then get the syntax right
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
down uh represent me yes on
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
representative oery it was actually when
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
we last had to deal with all of these
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
different kinds of Charities I think it
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
was at least eight years ago um there we
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
as I remember we killed her I asked the
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
bill and there was going to be a study
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
committee trying to make it work better
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
and it didn't
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
happen on I will say that my brain felt
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
like it was in a fog the whole
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
time so uh I don't think this is going
 
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
to be easy but if the legal Minds on our
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee could collaborate with each
 
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
other over email or something
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
and try to figure it
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
out we we've gotten till May
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
25 yeah no I I think um my sense right
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
now would be for representative
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and representative Ames to
 
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
work possibly with uh Michael of the
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
trust division to come up with language
 
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
that the three of you feel is
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh because I think we
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
could go around and around in circles
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
right now most of us um not
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
being that familiar with this
 
01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:40.189 align:start position:0%
being that familiar with this
representative

01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
Ori thank thank you
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
um it's more comp more comprehensive
 
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
than just this particular bill there's a
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
several other bills that are out there
 
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
that we've actually heard a couple of
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
them this year um the def and we killed
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
one of them recently the definition of a
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
charity in New Hampshire is seems to be
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
either super broad or limited to 501
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
c3s and it's not entirely clear how that
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
operates and how that's going to to work
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the point that uh
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative am uh as excuse me um me
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
was starts with an A close enough it's
 
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
got an m in it too so that that may be
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
part of what they need to determine um
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
the intent is it do we do we just want
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
5013 C's or do we want a broader
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
definition that maybe partly what they
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
can uh help determine represent Aly yeah
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's another uh body that I had noted
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
that we ought to check with there is a
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
board of of
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
auctioneers and uh so we ought to check
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
with the oplc about this
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
too okay represent fellow so I just want
 
01:31:07.709 --> 01:31:07.719 align:start position:0%
to say that based on where this is in
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
the statute it's very it's this is in
 
01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:12.510 align:start position:0%
the statute it's very it's this is in
the

01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
licensing statute it's the one that's
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
licensing an Auctioneer so it and it's
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
in a section that says exemptions so lot
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know to be an Auctioneer you have to
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
have all these certain
 
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications and then this particular
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
section of that um licensing says you
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to get have you you can do
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
auctioneering activities without a
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
license that's what this paragraph is
 
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
about so it's clearly it it's going into
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
the um the professional licensing
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
statutes so it's not licensing an
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
organization and that's that part is
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
clear I also like to would point out
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
that what we got from the sen Senate
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
says that this paragraph is about
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
charity auctions by
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and in the process of getting
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
additional um amendments done from for
 
01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.830 align:start position:0%
additional um amendments done from for
this

01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:29.709 --> 01:32:29.719 align:start position:0%
um and in that act this is L um OSS made
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
changes to definition of what this this
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
act is about because that's their
 
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
prerogative you you can give them a
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion but they can change that part
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
that says an act in description of the
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
act so in in mine they changed it to
 
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
allowing certain Char charitable
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
organization in certain religious
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
organization ations to engage in
 
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.310 align:start position:0%
organization ations to engage in
unlicensed

01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
unlicensed
 
01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
unlicensed
auctioneering

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
um organizations to engage an unlik
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
licensed auction Auctioneer who is not a
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
member of the organization and then in
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
um the chair's Amendment they changed it
 
01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.669 align:start position:0%
um the chair's Amendment they changed it
to

01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
say allowing certain charitable
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
organizations and certain religious
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
organizations to G
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
an unlicensed Auctioneer who is not a
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
resident of the organization but in both
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
of those two amendments that's clearly
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
significantly different than what came
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
from the sentence from the Senate that
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
says charity auctions by nonprofit
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
organizations which are
 
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
501c3 you at least as far as I know and
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
um churches and these two references are
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
not um automatically
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
501c3 and usually they're not 501 c3s so
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.030 align:start position:0%
this is
not

01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
significant inconsistencies here yeah I
 
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day we've got to
 
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
go back to the fact that there's there
 
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
this needs to be cleaned up and um I
 
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
think uh you know as as I said if
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative Ames and representative
 
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
spillsbury are willing to and obviously
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
taking input from anyone else but
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
primarily uh figure this out work with
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
Michael Haley come up with language that
 
01:34:22.719 --> 01:34:24.550 align:start position:0%
Michael Haley come up with language that
clarifies

01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
so I my perspective is this needs to go
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
back to the sponsors to find out exactly
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
what their intent was and
 
01:34:38.109 --> 01:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
that um that needs to be clarified
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
before the charity Bureau can can
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
identify what statutes need to be
 
01:34:44.119 --> 01:34:45.629 align:start position:0%
identify what statutes need to be
referenced

01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
because using that they have to fall
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
under these two the RSA and the US um
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
statute us um code that this is only
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
about churches and religious
 
01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
organizations and it leaves out all the
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
other things that are that are nonprofit
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
the food food bank you know New
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Food Bank tons and tons of
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
nonprofit private schools often hold U
 
01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
ch um you know Charities for their
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
operating funds or for the building fund
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's would say
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative PL I just looked up RSA
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
721b okay and it says charitable
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
organization shall mean the following
 
01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
any person or entity is determined by
 
01:35:37.629 --> 01:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
the IRS to be ATT tax exemp organization
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
pursuant section 501c3 of the Internal
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue code as that section now exists
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
or may thereafter be amended or this is
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
the or is important any other person or
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
entity that is or holds itself out to be
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
established in whole or aart for any
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
benevolent philanthropic patriotic
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
educational Humane scientific Public
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
Health Environmental Conservation Civic
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
or other charitable purpose or any
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
person who in any uh you get the picture
 
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
I just blew up but but it covers
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
everybody so yeah that's so that's
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
exactly the point that I think the chair
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
is attempting to make it's both and
 
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
neither so can I just ask what exactly
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
what he was quoting because that doesn't
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
match up with what I
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
found uh well he
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
I can do that I say 72 721b yeah I I I
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
just think
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh one at a time seven hyphen excuse me
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
seven what's it dot on dot colon uh 21
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
definitions and then under
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
B this is this one referred to it
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
is what representative
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
names well you know it's clearly
 
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
confusion so I don't know we we need to
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
take this off and and fix it up but uh
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
the the document uh that you passed out
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative fellos that explains the
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
key elements of RSA 721 2B is
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
incomplete it doesn't have the whole
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
statute I think you know in part of of
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ames and
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury working on
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
this it's to
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
also understanding you know the purpose
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
the the purpose and also what the RSA is
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
referring to here actually do so that
 
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
you can come up with a comprehensive
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
solution so I think at this point we'
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
beat this one to death and uh we will uh
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
I will close exe I'm sorry the work
 
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
session on uh s SP
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
513 thank you assume we don't exec
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
needed that one
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
like yeah we I think it's pretty obvious
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
we will not be executing uh SP 513 this
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay last but not least I will
 
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
s514 and um representative PL you have
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
your hand up yes I did uh I have no
 
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill it's it's the uh
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh revenues uh by
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
increasing uh the uh amount of wood and
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
whatever form that can be taken for
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
personal use uh not subject to Timber
 
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
tax the the revenue impact of that is di
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
Minimus uh and uh to use the word yeah
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
to use the word Dom Minimus yeah or it
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't amount to squat is this it's
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
another way of putting the same thing
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's 200 bucks a year maybe to an
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
average municipality and $5 increments
 
01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
and it's more hassle than it's
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
worth thank
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
you anybody else here than you represent
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
okay we have agreement there um I guess
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
we can move on I don't see any other
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
questions or concerned so I'll close the
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
514 okay now um we're I want to uh break
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
and have um exact uh I mean caucuses or
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
at least U
 
01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sure both sides may want to have a
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
caucus before we get to the exec session
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
but the time being 20 of 12 the probably
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to put lunch in there as
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
well unless people are against that U
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
but I think I'd rather starve to death
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
you'd rather starve to death okay um I'd
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
lunch so
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
we why don't we
 
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:58.109 align:start position:0%
we why don't we
um

01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
well no we we're we're going to have at
 
01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
least one caucus
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
um so I guess it's 20 of 12
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
um we come back I think why don't we
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
come back at
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
what well we gonna have lunch or not I
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
mean do what do people want to do do you
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
want to have lunch or I mean
 
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.550 align:start position:0%
want to have lunch or I mean
historically

01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:40:24.109 --> 01:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
are how many people want to just have a
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
Cox come back at 12 and try to exec
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
these okay I think
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's what we will
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
do all right so uh we will uh start the
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
o' I would ask everyone um to leave the
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
room please except Republicans and we'll
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
have a caucus
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%

that uh some of their licenses a small

percentage are monthly or quarterly and
 
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
they couldn't handle this so they wanted
 
02:07:23.549 --> 02:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure it applied only to annual
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%

02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%

consensus that the timing isn't right
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
but we shouldn't foreclose the option we
 
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
can wait and see what the Senate does
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%

not putting it to

uh well done uh thank you everybody so
 
02:32:02.670 --> 02:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
next week um as per the email that IID
 
02:32:05.550 --> 02:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
sent earlier about reserving uh time I
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
will schedule a meeting
 
02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
for um Tuesday of next week um really
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
the only items we well let me first ask
 
02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury and Ames do
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
you think by
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
next is next week too early to have
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
feedback on uh five 13 or yes represent
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
spills I certainly think it's possible
 
02:32:34.319 --> 02:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
spills I certainly think it's possible
um

02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:38.269 --> 02:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
but just a matter of zeroing and
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
focusing on it my question is how many
 
02:32:43.269 --> 02:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
additional Senate bills have we already
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
got in our docket so that that that yeah
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
therein lies what I'm trying to figure
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
out right now there's only two other
 
02:32:50.910 --> 02:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
there's only only two Senate bills that
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
have been added to our uh docket so far
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
and um they um so I was planning on
 
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
seeing how things went today and and
 
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
finishing up any execs next week and
 
02:33:06.030 --> 02:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
then doing the two public
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
hearings but that's all we really have
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
right now it's two public hearings and
 
02:33:09.920 --> 02:33:11.389 align:start position:0%
right now it's two public hearings and
possibly

02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
02:33:14.110 --> 02:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
513 given that we've acted on six out of
 
02:33:16.190 --> 02:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
seven have only two new ones and have
 
02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
plenty of time maybe we don't even need
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
to meet next week and and wait for the
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
final uh wave of bills from the Senate
 
02:33:26.269 --> 02:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we probably don't really need to
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
meet next week unless somebody feels
 
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:31.790 align:start position:0%
that we
do

02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:33:33.790 --> 02:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
mys okay I think we're I think we're
 
02:33:35.389 --> 02:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
doing great I think we're we're moving
 
02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
along very nicely so I will not schedule
 
02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
anything for next week that brings us to
 
02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
the week after when I I had said to
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
reserve Monday and Tuesday of the week
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
after probably it's only going to we're
 
02:33:49.469 --> 02:33:49.479 align:start position:0%
only going to Pro and I and I'll focus
 
02:33:51.550 --> 02:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
more on a Tuesday because I notice I
 
02:33:53.070 --> 02:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
know people try to schedule things on
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
Mondays and Fridays um unless we get a
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
barrage of Senate bills um I don't
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate meeting more than whatever
 
02:34:03.269 --> 02:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
what is that date of the following week
 
02:34:07.269 --> 02:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
the the 9th Tuesday Tuesday the 9th so
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
so I guess for right now probably
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the 9th we'll try to exec maybe
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
s SP
 
02:34:17.389 --> 02:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
513 um representative Ames and
 
02:34:19.710 --> 02:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
spillsbury kind of keep in mind that so
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
two weeks from now we'll try to exec
 
02:34:24.429 --> 02:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
5113 and then we'll have public hearings
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
on uh the Senate bills that are at least
 
02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
the two and any any new ones that come
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
in uh at that time so representative uh
 
02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
Aly yeah on the 11th is
 
02:34:46.429 --> 02:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
crossover and we'll probably get any
 
02:34:50.429 --> 02:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
most Senate bills that we would get then
 
02:34:54.110 --> 02:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
after that okay which would mean two
 
02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:59.230 align:start position:0%
after that okay which would mean two
weeks

02:34:59.230 --> 02:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
away um but I guess so you're oh you're
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
saying we we might only still have two
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
sen Senate bills at that time maybe
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
three I don't know yeah um well let's
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
Okay let me look at the calendar so
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
you're you're proposing is you won't
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
know until until Thursday so yeah that
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm saying leave so we won't
 
02:35:23.150 --> 02:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
meet next week it sounds like there's no
 
02:35:26.030 --> 02:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:28.190 align:start position:0%
need to
um

02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:31.630 --> 02:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
but leave open Tuesday the night I mean
 
02:35:33.309 --> 02:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
probably only need one day I I don't
 
02:35:35.269 --> 02:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
know that we need to reserve the eth
 
02:35:37.269 --> 02:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
unless someone thinks I'm missing
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
something um it's a little bit F let's
 
02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
give it a little more time but I think
 
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's only going to be the 9th we will
 
02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
not tely plan on the eth as well but as
 
02:35:56.750 --> 02:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.469 --> 02:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
saying oh you're saying 10 n so we might
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
not we got two pieces so we dispatched
 
02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
454 was the one was the one that needed
 
02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
that was the only early bill that's done
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
so um yeah it's it's possible we might
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
not meet until Tuesday the
 
02:36:22.190 --> 02:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
okay T TBD but for now we're not meeting
 
02:36:28.269 --> 02:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
next week the week of the 1 um but
 
02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
continue to leave open
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
um the 9th I don't think we need the eth
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
just leave open the
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
9th okay thank you any other yes
 
02:36:41.469 --> 02:36:41.479 align:start position:0%
represent elberger so I just want to
 
02:36:44.790 --> 02:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
confirm nothing next week right let's
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
skip you're cancelling Monday the 8th
 
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
yes I don't think we need Monday
 
02:36:52.910 --> 02:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
and if we meet on the 9th we'd be
 
02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:54.510 align:start position:0%
and if we meet on the 9th we'd be
executing

02:36:54.510 --> 02:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
executing
 
02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:56.309 align:start position:0%
executing
first

02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
um and the reason I'm asking is working
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
around a doctor's appointment yeah
 
02:37:03.790 --> 02:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
um there's only one bill yeah there'd
 
02:37:06.269 --> 02:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
only be one bill to exact and that would
 
02:37:06.279 --> 02:37:07.429 align:start position:0%
only be one bill to exact and that would
be

02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:37:09.870 --> 02:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
5113 I don't suspect
 
02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
it and that but that would be the first
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
item that we would do um it doesn't have
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
to be it would be easier oh that's your
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
problem um pleas the only reason for
 
02:37:23.230 --> 02:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
well no I guess you don't know how long
 
02:37:25.710 --> 02:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
public hearings go either
 
02:37:28.990 --> 02:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah we could probably
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
exec uh that any Tuesday meeting starts
 
02:37:35.269 --> 02:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
at 10: in difference to the Democratic
 
02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
caucus who's not available till 10: so
 
02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
we could exect that at 10 o'clock if we
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.230 --> 02:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
night it's possible that we won't meet
 
02:37:50.429 --> 02:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
that week of the 8th and 9th either but
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
for now I would say leave the ninth open
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
just in case I do get a barrage of
 
02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
tennis tenant tenis right Senate bills
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
in it would have to be a barrage of the
 
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh early of early bills from the
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
Senate um because uh we've got until May
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
them there's a good chance we won't meet
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
on the ninth either but but leave it
 
02:38:20.670 --> 02:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
Reserve for
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
now yeah there's no need to reserve the
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:31.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions uh oh the last
 
02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
thing is just reports those of you who
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
have a report to write um you don't you
 
02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't need to write it now before you
 
02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
leave um and I think the preference my
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
preference would be to have it rather
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
than write it out on a sheet of paper to
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
to email it to me electronically because
 
02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
for two reasons one is if there's
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
anything that needs to be changed on it
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's easier to change but it's also heck
 
02:39:01.110 --> 02:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
of a lot easier for Karen not to have to
 
02:39:03.469 --> 02:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
uh read writing and and so forth so
 
02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
especially with my writing which is
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
abysmal I was mainly thinking no I'm
 
02:39:08.670 --> 02:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
just kidding
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
U um so in terms of timing of that if
 
02:39:14.910 --> 02:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
you can obviously for the count it's not
 
02:39:17.309 --> 02:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
critical because we have time but if you
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
if you can get them in um before noon
 
02:39:21.630 --> 02:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
time on
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or or sooner if you get it in
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
tonight or by say noon time Wednesday
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
great if you just absolutely can't do it
 
02:39:31.710 --> 02:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh then by the end of the week but I
 
02:39:35.910 --> 02:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
would my preference would be sooner than
 
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
later there's nothing else any other
 
02:39:39.950 --> 02:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
questions I think we're yes represent
 
02:39:42.269 --> 02:39:42.279 align:start position:0%
fellows yes I'm wondering if we could
 
02:39:47.349 --> 02:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
get some research on um 597 the new one
 
02:39:49.710 --> 02:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
coming up rout relative to the Lucky
 
02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:51.070 align:start position:0%
coming up rout relative to the Lucky
Seven

02:39:51.070 --> 02:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
Seven
 
02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
tickets because it seems to me I think
 
02:39:56.110 --> 02:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
we passed something last year related to
 
02:39:59.190 --> 02:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
that and I just wanted to be able to
 
02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
compare I don't I don't even know if
 
02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
what we passed last
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
year actually I don't know but I mean
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
obviously it'll start with a public
 
02:40:10.429 --> 02:40:10.439 align:start position:0%
hearing and and Lottery being here um
 
02:40:12.670 --> 02:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
they probably would be an immense help
 
02:40:16.510 --> 02:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
in that regard and um then schedule work
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
sessions as appropriate to get
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
additional info
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
unless there I mean if there's something
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
specific that you'd like to get you
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
could request request it but for now not
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
knowing what bill it is or anything okay
 
02:40:33.550 --> 02:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
they may answer all those questions all
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
right anybody
 
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:48.240 --> 02:41:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
things

02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
for
