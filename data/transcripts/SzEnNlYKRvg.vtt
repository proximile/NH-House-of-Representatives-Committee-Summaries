good morning it being 10:00 I'd like to
 
00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
start the presentation for uh the
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
hb25 let's lead off with the Department
 
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
of Corrections
 
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
works good morning for the record my
 
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
name is Helen Hanks I'm the commissioner
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Corrections and to
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
my left is Heidi ly our administrator of
 
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
logistics I'm going let her take the
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
lead on this
 
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
morning I'm going to um briefly go
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
through um the approved projects and
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
then um a couple of additional projects
 
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
that we are requesting the committee
 
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
consider on page two of the presentation
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
in front of you uh We've listed out the
 
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed capital budget items
 
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
um numbers one two and three and beside
 
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
that we've listed what the Department's
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
priority is on those um the governor's
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
proposed number one was for electronic
 
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
controls and Camera
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
installations that is the Department's
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
priority number two Governor's propos
 
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
number two is to replace the HVAC units
 
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
using R22 refrigerant that is the
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
agency's priority number three and the
 
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed number three is the
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
boiler Surge and diator tank
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
Replacements that is the Department's
 
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
priority number
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
one some additional projects we're
 
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to consider today
 
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
are um replace the body alarm and manown
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
system at the Northern New Hampshire
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility additional funding
 
00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
for steam lines and traps at the New
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men replacing
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
the fire alarm systems at the New
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men and the
 
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
transitional work center in North End
 
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
house and uh removing the underground
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
diesel storage tank and installing above
 
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
ground tanks at the New Hampshire state
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
prison for men and the uh total
 
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
additional consideration is 15.4
 
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
million so so to review the um already
 
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
approved items number one is the boiler
 
00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
Surge and deat tank Replacements on page
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
three you can see the inside of one of
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
our old boilers our boilers are were
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
over 40 years old um we recently had two
 
00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
replaced uh we retubed the third one but
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that failed U because the
 
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
boiler was just beyond um repair um so
 
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
that third boiler is no longer in
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
service at this time we are using using
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
a temporary portable boiler system for
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
the winter months because our um
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
facility does need the three boilers to
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
operate in the winter
 
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
season uh on page four um it tells you
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
that boiler one's no longer in service
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
um as I said we're using a leased
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
temporary boiler our surge tank is also
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
unrepairable has a leak in it um that we
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
can't determine where that is because of
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
the insulation um and the tank is over
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
40 years old um Department of
 
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
administrative Services was kind enough
 
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
to give that us a tank that they were
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
not using however it's un undersized for
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
the existing system so although it's
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
being used temporarily it's not a
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
permanent solution um and the average
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
life expectancy for boiler equipment is
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
about 30 years on the New Hampshire
 
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
Doc's equipment is well over that
 
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
expectancy at over four years
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
old our next priority is electronic
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
controls and Camera installations it's
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire state prison for men
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
um currently we're using analog style
 
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
cameras in um quite a few places we have
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
313 total cameras of those 252 are still
 
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.589 align:start position:0%
313 total cameras of those 252 are still
analog

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
analog
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
cameras um the the technology on them is
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
outdated um the pictures are very hard
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
to see they're not clear um we've lost
 
00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
ability to zoom in and out in some cases
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
um digital cameras would provide a
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
clearer high resolution um image more
 
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
maneuverability uh increased zoom
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
capabilities and they have additional
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
features such as facial recognition Line
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
crossing and object detection and they
 
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
would provide improved operational
 
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:12.919 align:start position:0%
transparency and PR compliance and would
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
help protect the state from legal
 
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
challenges as well as provide safety
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
staff priority number three is to
 
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
replace the HVAC units using R22
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
refrigerant uh the EPA banned production
 
00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
of hydrofluoric chloro
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
hydrochlorofluorocarbons um used it
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
which is used in R22 um that ban took
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
place in 2020 so R22 refrigerant is no
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
longer manufactured or imported into the
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
US So currently there's a high demand um
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
for the product but a very limited
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
Supply which is depleting as each year
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
goes by and which is causing the price
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
to continue to rise for that currently
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
our 22 average is about $120 per pound
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
um the nor newer more environmentally
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
friendly refrigerants such as R 410A
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
averages about $60 per pound which is
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
half the cost um our existing um HVAC
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
systems that use the R22 refrigerant are
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
in poor condition and in need of
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
replacement due to age many of them
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
again over 40 years old original to the
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
buildings when they were
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
constructed um and replacing these hbac
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
systems would provide the state with
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
some Energy Efficiency um cost savings
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
state the agency's priority number four
 
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
and this is an additional project we're
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
asking the committee consider um the
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire convectional
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
facility um to replace the body alarm
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
and manown system their existing Bosch
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
Security escort system was installed in
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
2000 the year the facility was opened um
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
the system utilizes approximately 110
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
personal transmitters which transmit a
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
signal to the prison's main control when
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
a distress alarm is activated by the
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
user Bosch no longer manufactures this
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
system or any components of this system
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
they issued an end of life notice on
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
April 1st
 
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
2022 and the doc was obtaining
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
replacement transmitters and system
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
parts from third-party retailers such as
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
eBay and Facebook Marketplace for a
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
period of time um but stock has now been
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
depleted we can't find more than a oneof
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
here or a one there um certainly not
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
what we need to maintain this system
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
um so we now that we can no longer see
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
Parts um as the transmitters break down
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
and can't be repaired they are offline
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have a replacement for
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
them the next project we're asking the
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee to consider is the additional
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
funding for steam lines and traps at the
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state prison for men we
 
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
did recently complete a project that
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
replaced a significant number of uh feet
 
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
of steam line underground um in the
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
facility which helped considerably
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
considerably um with the leaking however
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
we do have one substantial leak um that
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
runs from our Boiler House to um inside
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
the facility and the that leak is
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
costing us about 16,000 to 18,500
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
gallons of water loss per day
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not something can be
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
repaired without excavation through the
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
building um this loss obviously
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
increases our water usage and our boiler
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
chemical treatment usage and add and in
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
turn adds cost to our operating budget
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
it also causes a reduction in the boiler
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
operational efficiency equivalent to
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
about 211 horsepower which is about
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the boiler operational
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
capacity of our boilers so essentially
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
we have one boiler that's only operating
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
at about onethird capacity due to this
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
loss and this loss is also creating
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
strain on our brand new boilers which
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
are working working harder to compensate
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the loss of the condensate
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
return priority number six that we're
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to consider is to
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
replace the fire alarm systems at New
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men including
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
transitional work center and North End
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
house as you can see from the photos we
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
have quite a bit of
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
deterioration um the annual maintenance
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
costs on our fire alarm system and 2024
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
were approximately
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
$39,000 um we get frequent system faults
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
and Phantom alarm activations due to the
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
deteriorating wiring um and this is
 
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
causing the fire department to respond
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
to non-emergency several times a year um
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
there is one Loop that attaches to five
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
buildings underground and that is one of
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
the root causes and it's nearly
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
impossible to find the source of the
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
fault on that Loop um just because of
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
how long it is and how far it
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
goes um the system's been modified and
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
added to over the years much of the old
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
wiring was abandoned in place by
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
contractors so when new contractors come
 
00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959 align:start position:0%
in to make repairs they're dealing with
 
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
essentially spaghetti wires trying to
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
find the source of the problem
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
um which adds obviously to the labor
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
costs um and the time that they're
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
spending doing
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
that um and the fire alarm system is
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
required to comply with NFPA
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
7214 2.2.2 point2 um which states that
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
system deficiencies shall be corrected
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
um for over three years now these
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
deficiencies have been noted on the
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
annual inspection reports by the state
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
fire Marshall's office due to the above
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
issues with the system um we do have do
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
try to facilitate repairs as much as
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
possible but sometimes s it just comes
 
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
down to they they can't find where the
 
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.389 align:start position:0%
down to they they can't find where the
issue

00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
is um priority number seven that the
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
agency is asking the committee can
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
consider is to remove our remaining one
 
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
undergrounds diesel storage tank and
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
install above ground tanks in that
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
location um the tank and Associate
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
piping and controls need substantial
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
repairs to comply with the New Hampshire
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
environmental reg regulations this tank
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
is oversized based on the agency's
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
annual use of diesel fuel which is
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
mostly used to operate our equipment and
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
emergency generators so we're seeking to
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
remove the tank um and replace it with
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
two 600 gallon above ground storage
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
tanks one as a primary used tank and one
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
purposes um on page 17 we go into a
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
little bit about the replacement for the
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
correctional facility so the original
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
$10 million that was passed by
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
government Council um we have we are
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
utilizing engineering firm drr group
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
who's been doing um some site evaluation
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
um they've done a complete evaluation of
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
the site up and back um test boring um
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
utilities exploration um and they've
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
done some programming meetings or almost
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
all the programming meetings to get a
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
sense of how the docc operates and what
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
our needs are and um they'll be
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
completing a detailed master plan
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
document for the over 300 acres of docc
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
land which is up behind the New
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire correctional facility for
 
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
women so they've completed Wetlands D
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
delineation the traffic study Geotech
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
borings and test pits um environmental
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
site assessment and um a utility
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
assessments um they've had visioning
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
sessions as I said and we should be
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
receiving um a final proposal from them
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
in May of
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
2025 with their recommendations on where
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
to site the new
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
facility on the $40
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
million um this will be for fall
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
architectural engineering services for
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
all design phases this will be for
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
schematic design design development
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
construction documents bid support and
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
construction Administration for the new
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
facility so it'll be a comprehensive
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
complete design and as part of that
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
we'll have a better idea what the
 
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
estimated cost will be for a replacement
 
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.990 align:start position:0%
estimated cost will be for a replacement
facility

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
on page 20 um the projects that we are
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
um looking to lapse are listed excuse me
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me just just just one second
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
please I'd like to I'd like to stop
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
right there we've been stopping before
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
we get to the C the laps extensions make
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
sure if we've got any questions on any
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
of this right now please go ahead and
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
ask them from any oh we have a number of
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman Lisa thank
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
you very much for your presentation a I
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate a couple
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions there's a lot of the
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures proposed for Capital
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
Improvements and I think historically as
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
a committee we're well aware especially
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the Men's prison that I
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
think the word dire doesn't begin to sum
 
00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:46.839 align:start position:0%
up the situation that's going on there
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
um not that I'm in a recycling mode but
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
as we move forward and as we begin the
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
process of building the new men's
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
present is it conceivable that some of
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations that we're
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
considering today or Capital
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
Improvements would find their way to the
 
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.230 align:start position:0%
Improvements would find their way to the
new

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
facility possibly um so the if we were
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
to replace the air handlers um with the
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
new Air Handlers those could potentially
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
be moved they'd have to be certainly
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
sized for um the location that they were
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
going in um but what the committee needs
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind too is we do have to
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
keep the current facility in full
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
operation um so to move an air Handler
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
to the new facility before we're ready
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
to actually move people over um might be
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
difficult so I think for the majority of
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
projects that's um not going to be able
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
to be feasible um the only one would be
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
the underground storage tank that is
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
located actually at the warehouse
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
facility um so that would continue
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
forward with the construction of the new
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
men's facility and representative I
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
would add part of the camera uh project
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
I asked the same question with the hope
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to take that
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
technology and move it up um part of the
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
concern lack of commitment we can't make
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
is whether it technology is going to
 
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
shift so much in approximately 10 years
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
even what we do now would be obsolete by
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
the time we moved in but we were looking
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
for those opportunities and gains and
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's a fair consideration commissioner
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that follow up Mr chairman
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
follow up okay regarding the underground
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
diesel storage tank you're looking to
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
remove it what's the benefit of removing
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
it as opposed to filling it up with sand
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
or cement and capping It Off
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and we actually
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
haven't explored that option um we
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
worked with environmental services and
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
we had an outside agency come in and
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
look to see the Litany of issues that
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
existed with the tank um I can certainly
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
find out if that's an option for us um
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
but it is an underground tank and it is
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
piped into um the warehouse building so
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way that would have
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
and sir I I asked the same question
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
ironically I appreciate your question
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
there is diesel in it now uh part of the
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
question U that arose when I said could
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
we do just that uh was is there a way to
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
recycle any of the diesel that's in
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
there is there rust and erosion that
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
makes it unusable so very appropriate
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh further questions uh
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative Brown representative uh
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
Newman I'm going to save you last
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
because I suspect I know what your
 
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.230 align:start position:0%
because I suspect I know what your
question

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
is thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
similar questions to representative
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
voids on the diesel tank and I do have
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
some experience with that so I would
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
expect that you could abandon the tank
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
in place as representative Boyd
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
indicated but my concern is uh it's
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
still operating so have monitoring Wells
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
been put in place is there any failure
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
or any diesel that's escaped from the
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
tanks or the piping
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
not that we're aware of um so so the
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
tank is approximately 5,000 gallons um
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
I've worked with the agency for just
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
over three years and we haven't filled
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
it yet um we use approximately just
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
below 400 gallons a year of diesel um so
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
we've just been slowly kind of chipping
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
away of that until we can get it to the
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
under I believe it's 600 gallons it's
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
required to put it into temporary
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
closure um and that's kind of where
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
we're at at this point we're just kind
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
of trying to use up the diesel so that
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
we can put it into temporary closure and
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we have any monitoring
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
Wells at this point um because there are
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
methods of testing the tank to make sure
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
that there's not any failure if there's
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
no failure I would think that we'd be
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
able to continue using that um till you
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
remove the diesel you can also pump that
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
diesel out filter it and put it into the
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
new tanks if you do indeed want to uh
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
replace that so if you want to discuss
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
that further I'd be certainly be glad to
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
talk to you about that but I would be
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
concerned about putting new tanks
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
especially since the plan is they have
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
such low use and there's no failure or
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
no piping issue with with the tanks I
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
would think that Dees would be able to
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
monitor that and at least extend that
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
use and maybe reduce the capacity of the
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
tank to just have the emergency capacity
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
kept in that tank so that's my thought
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
and I I have another question Mr
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
chairman sir um um the uh the man down
 
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.669 align:start position:0%
chairman sir um um the uh the man down
system

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
um who who uses that how many is that
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the guards that use that system or
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
who uses that system no so that would be
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
for our Correctional line staff or
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
civilian staff in the facility and
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
visitors so when visitors come to tour
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
the facility or or anything like that
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
they're issued a a body alarm tag so
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's a safety issue for for those
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
people thank you very much I appreciate
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
that any further questions
 
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.990 align:start position:0%
that any further questions
representative

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
vone thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so to follow up
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
on the body alarm so you've got 110 uh
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
units that are still that you have in
 
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.430 align:start position:0%
units that are still that you have in
total

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes oh so 110 how many are in use
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
basically during the course of a day a
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
week a month or whatever so basically
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking for you know do you
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
have spares or are
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
you are you at the point where you're
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
saying we don't have any more for today
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
so nobody else can come in the the
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
facility it depends on the day I mean
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
certainly there some days is there going
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
to be more you know if we have a
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
visiting tour or some something like
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
that there might be more usage um we're
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
almost at the usage capacity so the 110
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
is approximately how how many are given
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
out on a daily
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
basis thank you representative
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you my question is on the
 
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.830 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you my question is on the
least

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
boilers you you amazed me I I thought it
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
was going to be kitchens I would have on
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
the kitchens you've always worried about
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
the kitchen thank you for reminding me
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
on the on the least boiler that you've
 
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
got right now is there like a
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance contract that comes with
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
that so you pay x amount of dollars and
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
they take full responsibility
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
for no
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
so the the fee to lease the boiler is
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
for the boiler itself so they brought it
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
delivered it and they connected it to
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
the connections that we had installed
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
our maintenance staff monitor and
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
submits weekly reports to the to the uh
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
vendor letting them know what treatment
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
was put in and the performance of the
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
boiler and at the end of the lease term
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
they will return disconnect it and take
 
00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:43.710 align:start position:0%
they will return disconnect it and take
it

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
away can you lease that continually
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
leasing it um we can um we don't
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
generally need it in the summer months
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
because we can operate on the two
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
boilers in the summer months when we
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't need heat the heat is what puts
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
the additional load on the boiler system
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
where we need the three
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
boilers okay could I I still have still
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
have a question about it so I I guess
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
looking forward to maybe 10 years out
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
when there is a new prison
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
if is it did you think at all about what
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't get money right now but
 
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be I hate to say least
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
forever but lease boilers until you get
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
to a new facility would that be
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
something I think it's a possibility um
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is that we have a a surge
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
tank that's under siiz so that still
 
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be replaced um we have a lot of
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
piping valving and other things that are
 
00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
piping valving and other things that are
have

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
deteriorated um our PK heaters which are
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
part of that system two of the four of
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
them don't work anymore um so there's a
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
lot of parts of the system that still
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
need to be replaced even if we to use
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
the temporary boiler every every Winter
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%

representative Brown thanks Mr chairman
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
I just just to follow up on the diesel
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
tanks the 600 gallons that you would
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
propose for the backup tank of these two
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
tanks is that used for electric backup
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
for security for that facility or what
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
is that what are those use for it would
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
be if we needed emergency fuel delivery
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
for our generators in the event of you
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
know long-term outage um any kind of
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
problems in the market where fuel became
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
an issue obtaining fuel became an issue
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
we need to keep the facility running so
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
that's a general power backup yes system
 
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.430 align:start position:0%
that's a general power backup yes system
thank

did put them out to bid previously um
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately the bids came back
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
more than doubl the appropriation um so
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
we had to descope the project a little
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
bit and it was going out for bid um the
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%

modular unit they'll be able to complete
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
site design um and so we would like to

being programmed
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
currently um some laps extensions that
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
we had uh previously requested but no
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
longer need is for the boiler
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
Replacements um that project has had
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
ended a little quicker than we
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated it was um so we should be um
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
all all set to lapse that um the door if
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
I could just interject uh that's number
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
65 in house build 25 okay um the door
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
control upgrade at um Northern Hampshire
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
ctional facility again we were having
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
some programming issues with that so we
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
were initi initially going to extend it
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
um but they've since resolved those so
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
we are um okay to lapse those that's
 
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.909 align:start position:0%
we are um okay to lapse those that's
number

00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
66 and the last item um that we no
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
longer need a lapse extension on is the
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
construction um Training Center building
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
or for um sorry construction and
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
Training Center for Building Trades at
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%

64 so the on the lapse extension
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
requests on page 21 um first is the door
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
Replacements this was for a replacement
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
of shoe perimeter doors yard wall doors
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
and fence doors um and as I said the
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
first round of bids came at more than
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
came in at more than double the
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
allocated funding so we descoped the
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
project it's currently being prepared
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
for rebid we're estimating a start of
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
construction of this fall with a
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
just some um lightning protection they
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
need to finish up um so those should be
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
completed this month and then the plaza
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
deck above the kitchen and bakery area
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
is in construction with an estimated
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
2025 the rebuild sewer line and grinder
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
project this is to relocate the sewer
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
line and grinder station from Maguire
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
Street to the New Hampshire State Prison
 
00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
from men parking lot Island um it would
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
be replacement replacing the grinder and
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
add addition of augur equipment the
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
project includes a small building to
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
house the grinder and augur and we're
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
currently finalizing design on that
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
estimating for that to go out to bid
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
this spring with start of construction
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
2026 on page 25 the Hancock and
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
industries buildings roof replacement as
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
I said the Handcock roof replacement is
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
nearly complete again also lightning
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
protection just needs to be finished on
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
that so that should be complete this
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
month uh the estimated start a
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
construction on the industries roof um
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
is also looking like it will be this
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
month and the estimated completion will
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
2025 the CCU door and ceiling
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
replacement and repair this is
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
replacement of the CCU exterior tiar
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
doors and repairs to the ceiling in spew
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
the first first round of bids came in at
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
more than double the allocated funding
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
so again the project was descoped and is
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
currently being prepared for rebid with
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
an estimated start a construction in
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
Fall 2025 and an estimated completion in
 
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
Fall 2025 and an estimated completion in
Spring

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%

00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
with an estimated completion in summer
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%

programmed in the estimated
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%

00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
summer and on page 29 uh that lists the
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
projects that we are elapsing balances
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
on um the estimated lapse amounts are in
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
Jack uh thank you stunningly uh
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
everything cross checks with what I have
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh and the three it items that we need
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
to change are numbers 64
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
65 and
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
66 uh in House Bill 25 should be lapsed
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll delete
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
those and if I'm reading that correctly
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
you are are lapsing a balance of
 
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:57.750 align:start position:0%
you are are lapsing a balance of
$550,500

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative Boyd thank you Mr
 
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
chairman going to and thank you for
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
taking my questions today I appreciate
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
it regarding the uh the door and ceiling
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
replacement and repair having to put it
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
out a bit is is it your experience that
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
materials are costing more than what was
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
originally budgeted yes and um due to
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
the nature of the prison environment um
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
we had multiple mobilizations in the
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
original bid which added to the cost um
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
so we had to come up with a creative way
 
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
mobilizations so that it would bring the
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
cost down in in the second round bids
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
okay follow up Mr chair follow up um I
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
noticed on the list of extensions the
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
sewer sewer line is in design how is
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
that going because I I we heard the
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
comments from last year so I'm just
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
hearing how it's going yeah um it's
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
actually going very well the city is um
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
pleased with our design the city
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
engineer um we're just looking at some
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
final detail things at the moment like
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
you know where fans are going to be
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
located and doors and things like that
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
on the building itself um we did there
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
was some design difficulties because
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
this the height of the equipment is so
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
tall um but we're at a good place and
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
we're we should be bidding that out
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
probably in the next month wonderful
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
good to hear thank you very much thank
 
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr CH you're welcome any further
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you on the modular
 
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
kitchen is this the first time you've
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
gone to a modular
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
kitchen and and if I could
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
continue is your existing kitchen going
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
to be shut down and everything will most
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
of it so the primary part of the
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
existing kitchen and bakery area will be
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
shut down some office space will still
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
be used um and a storage room that's at
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
the very front of the building will
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
still be
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
used okay and last one one followup yes
 
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
it seems as though
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
maybe the first time I was there um is
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
is the health department behind going to
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
a modular kitchen or it's just that it's
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
just not feasible anymore to try them
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the difficulty becomes keeping the
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
kitchen operational while you've got
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
part of it shut down for um repairs it's
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
not sustainable given the number of
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
meals we're serving in a day um so we
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
just we couldn't pursue that so you'll
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
go to aular Kitchen from here on yes
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you you're welcome just
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
for clarification you were visiting
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
there you you weren't that's correct
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
okay we were visiting yeah just you just
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
casually said you know the last time I
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
was there you know that's why you're you
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
sounded like you were working in that
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
kitchen for a while so representative
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
Edgar uh thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
question it has to do with the uh
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
training session uh session or Center um
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's listed here on page 20 as being in
 
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.990 align:start position:0%
it's listed here on page 20 as being in
design

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
um has that been
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
completely eliminated now at this
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
point so thank you for that
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative we have um lived that
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
project and attempted to deliver on that
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
project for some time as you know um I
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
think at this point we recognize
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
that maybe one would say a failure to
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
launch uh but we want to try some
 
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
adjustments inside the building before
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
we ask the state for additional dollars
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
and feel it's a better return to the
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
general fund while we navigate an
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
interior space using some uh
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
modifications to filter out sawdust and
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
other things and test that first uh
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
because when we first went out to bid
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
the 300,000 I would have had to come
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
back and ask you for almost a million
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
dollars as a legislature to fund an
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
actual separate building we tried to
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
change the scope of the building and
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
location of the building that still
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't within the 300 plus thousand that
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
was around 600
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
$800,000 um and navigating all of the
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
things we've navigated Co and so on and
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
the arpa projects uh we just think this
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
is the responsible decision to make at
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
this point uh thank you thank you Mr
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
chair you any further questions yes
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
representative rockmore thank you Mr
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um my question is is
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
is it a pipe dream to imagine that
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps someday the kitchen that's being
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
decommissioned could someday be reborn
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
as a site for maybe some vocational
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
training some in the food Food Services
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
industry especially if perhaps license
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
plate manufacturing disappears from the
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
prisons I think the even the modular
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
kitchen as proposed would be appropriate
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
for us to continue a culinary arts
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
program so at the New Hampshire state
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
prison for men and at the New Hampshire
 
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
correctional facility for women there
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
are two culinary arts programs through
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
our vocational program and those
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
continue on uh despite the physical
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
limitations in the current space so
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to navigate that
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no further questions
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:26.109 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
good morning moving on to Department of
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
works good morning uh for the record um
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
Bob Scott commissioner with the
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
with me is Su Susan Carlson our chief
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
operating officer uh we have key staff
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
in the back as well so hopefully we'll
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
be able to answer any questions that you
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
have uh if it pleases the chair I'll
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll go through our uh slides uh
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
that we have proceed so thank you
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
so uh on slide two you'll see our our
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
summ of summary of our requests uh
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
effectively uh we're just just under $50
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
million and ask however I'll point out
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
and we'll go in detail in following
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
slides that uh just just shy of 20
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
million of that is for our wabaki River
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
Basin project which is bonded separately
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
and not part of the The General fund so
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
um so uh holistically what you'll see is
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
we as the agency uh we own and operate
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
uh and and maintain dams throughout the
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
state there are
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
263 or so uh state-owned dams um we also
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned we have a Wastewater Tuma
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
facility in Franklin and the collection
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
systems around that which uh serves 10
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
communities and then uh we'll go in a
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail uh we also
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
manage the the federal appropriation and
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
the repayment funds for the state
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds so the these have
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
um uh drinking water and wastewater uh
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
projects typically as as passrs to the
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
communities and then finally we'll talk
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
about uh not in order but uh a super fun
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
match uh for for uh for those entities
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
or those uh sites that don't have a uh
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
known responsible party uh the state
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
ends up taking uh some some share of the
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for the care and
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those sites so moving to
 
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.670 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those sites so moving to
slide

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
three uh I'll talk about dams a little
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
bit uh I will say uh this is part of a
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
larger uh concern concern that we have
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh there was a bill uh in the house uh
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
to start that followed a study committee
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
that was done last year to look at
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
funding for dams uh our request this
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
year is $10.8 million to to do Dam
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
repairs and Associated work uh the
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
typical going back over the decades the
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
again the monies generally come from the
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
the the capital budget for for Dam
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
repairs uh looking at our high Hazard
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
dams uh we rank uh the work with we do
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
but currently we're on a schedule of
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
rehabbing a dam uh every 100 years
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh which we don't find my my view is not
 
00:46:03.069 --> 00:46:03.079 align:start position:0%
really sustainable if you will the
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
average age of our dams State own dams
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
is about a 100 years old also so at some
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
point uh we have an ongoing discussion
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
we'd like to kind of get a a different
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
source of funding a more sustainable
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
funded uh way of maintaining dams uh
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a more of a user fee uh system
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
is what we're we'd like to to have some
 
00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
discussions with the legislature about
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
so moving beyond that issue what you see
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
in front of you is a list of uh 10
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
projects that we'd be doing with this
 
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
$10.8 million uh three of them are for
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
the Lakeport Dam uh which controls like
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
w w go basaki two of the projects are
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
for the Murphy Dam in Pittsburgh which
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
controls the head waters to the
 
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River um then we have um
 
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
some some uh two slope machines we're
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
again we're responsible for uh the
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the the grounds uh and to
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
make sure there's not improper erosion
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
around the the flood control dams uh
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
backup generators at at the facility in
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
silk Farm which is where we do the
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance and we deploy from should
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
there be an event and then uh we're
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
we're constantly upgrading and and
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
looking at our uh industrial control
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
controls or skater systems um in this
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
case we've uh we're looking at BO Lake
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
and straford Webster Lake in Franklin
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
little sunap Dam in New London
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the union Meadows Dam in Wakefield
 
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh is the work that's
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
slated on that end so and it so the last
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
thing I will
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
mention one of the questions the
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
committee the chair had sent to us is
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
what things had you asked for that are
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
not in
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
here were're were're it's workable for
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
us so we're not asking to be put in but
 
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
our original request had uh another $10
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
million for the four dams at pucky way
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
State Park uh our interest in that is at
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
least two of them need work sooner than
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
later and we're interested in lowering
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
that all at one time not doing four
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
different events where we take the the
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
Lake Puckaway and the state park out of
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
commission for for a year each time so
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to coordinate that so that
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
was originally on our request we're not
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
asking for it back but I want to give
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
you an idea of the type of things in the
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
need for for dams as we move
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
forward so moving to to slide four which
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
is labeled clean water and drinking
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
water srf match that's the state
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan Fund I referred to uh as
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
you can see the state provides a 20%
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
match for both our drinking water uh
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
funds and our clean water again clean
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
water is is code for storm water and
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
wastewater uh usually it's wastewater
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
treatment um so the the the big issue
 
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
here is under the um
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure act uh we've received
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of extra money which is funneled
 
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:04.799 align:start position:0%
federal money which is funneled through
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
the state revolving Loan Fund uh given
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
that we have to do a match for for much
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
of that this is what the increase that
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here U and again this is
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
for a combination of loan and full loans
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
or loans with loan forgiveness uh for
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
for the federal federal
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
money and again chair Mr chair anytime
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to question is f fine with
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
us obviously so moving to uh Slide Five
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll pass off uh to Susan Carlson
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
here but we have a little bit more
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
detail in the state revolving Loan Fund
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
match good morning for the record Susan
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
Carlson with the on this slide what I
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
tried to do is provide you with a little
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
more information about how the srf
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
program the grant program works we
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
receive a grant as the commissioner said
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
we receive grants from EPA for both
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
clean water and drinking water um we
 
00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
have a required 20% match on those
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
grants um in addition for the last five
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
years we've been receiving supplemental
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
Awards through the bill program also for
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
the last three of those five years we've
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
been required to provide a 20% match for
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
that so if you look at that if you look
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
at the chart for federal fiscal year 26
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
for both the clean water and drinking
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
water combined we're anticipating a
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
$22.1 million base Awards we're
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
receiving 47.5 in supplemental Awards um
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
total Awards adding up to 169 change
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
match requirement is 13.9 million we
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
have approximately a little over a
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars of match on hand so the
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
needed match for the federal fiscal year
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
26 Awards is 12.9 million in change and
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
if you notice when we get to 27 our base
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
Awards go up by approximately 4 million
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
again this is an estimate on our part um
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
the supplement awards are now completed
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
um through the bill program so our match
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
requirement drops down to 5.3 million in
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
change and those two combin add up to
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
the 18.3 that we are requesting it
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
should be noted that EPA will not give
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
us these Awards unless we have our match
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
in hand and in hand means an
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation so that's why you're we're
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
asking for these Awards now
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
M thank you so moving to slide six uh I
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier super fund State match
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
so again this is
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
for uh sites that have no identified
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
responsible party uh in this particular
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
case we we're additional work is needed
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
for a site that was formerly at the New
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plating company uh again it's
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
a super fund site uh the remedy that was
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
original originally put in place is
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
found out not now not to be sufficient
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
there's additional contaminants that
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
have been uh causing causing the issue
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
and this is our po portion of that uh
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
paying for that that um that remedy at
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
the site uh if there's questions on this
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
too again we have our Waste Management
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
director Mike whimet here uh who could
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
go into details if you
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
need and then uh finally on slide seven
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
I mentioned our Waki River Basin project
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
so uh we
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
are in an interesting position as an
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
agency and as a state we actually own
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
and operate a wastewater treatment
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
facility uh in Franklin and in the in
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
the collection systems that go with that
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's an odd odd situation in my
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
opinion because we are also the
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
regulator of that so we we regulate
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
ourselves which is unique so um but they
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
do a really good job however uh much
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
much indicative of all these systems
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and the country
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
much of the uh infrastructure is aging
 
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh this the funds that wabaki River
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
Basin is 100% funded out of the 10
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
member communities so there's not a
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
general funded fund um infusion of money
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
or that type of thing but since it's a
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
state-owned facility again it goes for
 
00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
the whole state system gets into the
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
budget and goes before you uh and again
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh su su Carl here can correct me if I'm
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
wrong but the the key here too is
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of needed needed work to
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
be done it's scheduled uh but again this
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
is bonded separately
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
not as the the main core of what you're
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
looking at so this is this is uh goes on
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
100% to those those member communities
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
and they and they repay the funds U as
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
they move forward so with that uh we're
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to answer any questions
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's a you know high level of our re
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
quests uh we do have uh the uh our laps
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have another handout here which
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
discusses our our
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
lapses uh and we can certainly discuss
 
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
those also so I again I wanted to be
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
know where the you know Mr chair
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
whatever You' like we're here at your
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
disposal thank you any questions for the
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
Department yes representative
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
BR I always have questions thank you Mr
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
chairman so on the dam repairs and
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
reconstruction couple of general
 
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
questions are these safety related
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
issues on on all these damps or just a
 
00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:33.829 align:start position:0%
issues on on all these damps or just a
service

00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
or operating to some extent they're all
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
safety re issues right so we do have we
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
we typically because again I mentioned
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
with the funding we get we're on a
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
100-year schedule so we we by by the
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
very nature of that we rack and stack
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
according to need uh and prior
 
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
prioritize High Hazard dams so we is we
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
have like 64 High Hazard dams whereby
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
which if the dam were to fail it
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
endangers life from property um so so
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately yes uh there there are again
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
263 state-owned dams there's another
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
2600 uh other dams in the state
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
also thank you Mr chairman so on these
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
dams you mentioned that you have four
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
projects at the PUO State Park I look
 
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:21.799 align:start position:0%
here at the uh summary sheet that you
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
have you have three project that look at
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
like they're at Lakeport and two
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
projects that are at at Murphy Dam corre
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
so were these projects that also had to
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
be coordinated and is this list in prior
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
to order as far as safety uh order or
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
how is this ordered I I'll have to defer
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
to cor Corey Clark he's the head of our
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
our dam Bureau uh but yes we try to
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
coordinate obviously lower most of these
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
repairs some of these repairs typically
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
involve lowering the level obviously lak
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
Port Dam uh we we would not like to
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
lower the level of uh Lake basaki by 12
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
ft which would be required if if we had
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
to take those those Gates out so so it
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
really depends again Corey I think does
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
a fine job uh of trying to navigate
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
there are times we we just don't have a
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
choice uh of mum's pond in barington is
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
a great example the the the pond there
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
the the dam there is being undercut
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
considerably so the dam needs to be
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
replaced there's just no ends a bus
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
about it I will I will and this is
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
generally at least since I've been
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner there's always been a
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
footnote on the budget for this that it
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
gives us the authority to kind of rack
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
and stack so for instance you you
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
approve this and we say thank you and we
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
move forward and then we find in our
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
inspections either there's a swirling
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
hole in front of a dam we prioritize
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
that and and we will use those funds so
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
so the ranking to the extent there is
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
which is what Cory's about to ask uh
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
answer uh it depends on the situation so
 
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
we we constantly evaluate and put the
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
money where it's most needed if that
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
makes sense so Cory can you sure for the
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
record Cory Clark chief engineer at the
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
dam Bureau nire Department of
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so just to
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit more certainly um
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
we try to prioritize the best we can
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's a snapshot in time knowing the the
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
issues that we have uh one of the one of
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we have is as
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned we have 64 High
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams in the state now quite quite
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
often you a low Hazard Dam that all of a
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
sudden has immediate issues in which we
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
have to lower the empowerment therefore
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
you're you're sometimes playing you know
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
you're juggling the the line you know
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
you're trying to hit those High Hazard
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
ones because if they were to fail
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
there'd be probable loss of life but
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes an issue at a lwh hazard Dam
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the economic loss of that
 
00:57:46.589 --> 00:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
empowerment is is uh is quite great
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
therefore we kind of bring that one up
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
the list and certainly as the
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner said when we dive into
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
these things we learn more and more one
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
thing um that I'll just mention is that
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
we were able to uh leverage about $30
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
million in arpa funds and we're
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
continuing to use that money towards the
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
repair and reconstruction of state owned
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
dams however as part of that we we did a
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
lot of studies with that money as well
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
which led to a lot of um unknowns
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
becoming knowns issues that we have at
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
various High Hazard sites um Pak Lakes
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
being one of those so one of the issues
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we found out with the four P Lakes
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that the the ultimate reconstruction
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
cost might be in excess of $10 million
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
so one of the things might be is further
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
down the line when we have better
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
construction estimates bring that back
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
forward to actually uh seek the repair
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
of those sites so um hope that answers
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
the question and certainly anything
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
else any further
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative jurus thank you
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and your skater system how
 
00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
old is the skater system and um are you
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
is there any thought to going to
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
yeah the ska system really came online I
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
would say probably about uh 10 20 years
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
ago as we we slowly started automating
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
some of these sites some of the the
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
first two sites that we automated was
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
Milton 3 ponds on the Salmon Falls River
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
and masoma Lake um about 20 years ago
 
00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
since that time we've been slowly trying
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
to implement um more and more sites not
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
only being automated but more and more
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
data being collected at the sites as the
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned there's several
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
sites that we're trying to bring online
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
um for for data and what that really
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
helps us is our flood forecasting uh a
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
lot of times we by knowing what's coming
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
into a particular impoundment we then
 
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
therefore know what we need to do at the
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
dam prior to seeing the lake come up as
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
far as you know implementing newer and
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
newer Technologies that's something
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
we're always looking to do and certainly
 
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
trying to bring things up to uh current
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
standards as we as we move it move
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
forward but unfortunately it's kind of a
 
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
the age of the infrastructure is is is
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 20 years old to to current
 
00:59:59.069 --> 00:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
so um we're slowly trying to bring
 
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
things up as we're replacing them and if
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
I could so the the the skat systems
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about our plcs they they
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
oh okay yes and we do work uh fairly
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
closely with the DHS CA s security
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Security Agency they have
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
a really good representative here in the
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
state that works closely with us to make
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
sure that we're paying attention to
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
cyber security issues also because it's
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
great to automate but we'd like not to
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
introduce more vulnerabilities into the
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
dams as well
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick follow up if I
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
could thank you Mr chairman uh so you're
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring and you're getting you're
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
getting these alarms any alarms in real
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
time is there also any video that you're
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
that you're pumping back to your your
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
office or your control site so we we are
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
getting the alarms real time we get
 
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
notified um when um you know anything
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
from a door to the gate house gets
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
opened to um high water alarms we have
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
alarms and monitoring walls at these
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
sites um we have brought in um camera
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
technology to several of these sites we
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
haven't gone to a full recording system
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
just because a lot of times these sites
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
are very public in and you know
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
notifying the public that they're being
 
01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
recorded we haven't we haven't made it
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
to that that phase yet but the reason
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest reasons we have the
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
the cameras out there is if we're going
 
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
to do an operation we can see is there a
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
fisherman standing in the middle of the
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
stream Downstream fly fishing we're not
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
all sudden inadvertently dumping water
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
on him so that's that's the biggest
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
reason for the cameras out there but
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're kind of in continuing talks um in
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
house as to you know do we want to take
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
this a step further further and really
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
start implementing security procedures
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
with those cameras as well you got it
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brown so thank
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman just so I make sure I
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
understand this process with the w
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
River Basin program there's 10 10 Towns
 
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
that use the system the state operates
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
the system but all the cost associated
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
with are char back to the 10 Towns is
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
that correct yes so uh we there's a um
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
what's the word I want there's a uh a
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
board Advisory board made up of the
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
towns so as as the budgets work through
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
they agree to it and they start to
 
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
program in to their rates to be able to
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
pay for it thank
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions let's
 
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
move on to
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
the capital budget laps
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
extensions I'm going to pass on to uh
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
Sue Carlson on that so you do have a
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
handout uh that goes through goes
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
through that so she's uh a good asset
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
for us to talk to how's that uh I'm
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
gonna ask representative Jack did did
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
you have any particular questions on
 
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
this or not or do you want to go through
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
it line by line let me just start by
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
saying uh there's a slight discrepancy
 
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
with Hospital 25 what they have is
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
number 78 is number 80 what they have is
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
79 is number 81 what they have is 80 is
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
number 78 and what they have is 81 is
 
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.029 align:start position:0%
number 78 and what they have is 81 is
number

01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
79 my
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
apologies I can only being one-handed
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
right now my typing isn't that
 
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.230 align:start position:0%
right now my typing isn't that
good

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
um yes good morning um as you can see
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
what I have done with this laps
 
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
extension memo is I have group the
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
extensions by the
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
topic um in the first two sections that
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
we are asking for laps extensions deal
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
with our hazardous waste match we have
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
two Appropriations that we are looking
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
to extend um the hazards waste matches
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
for the super fund programs this money
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
we are required by federal law to match
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
for 10% we do not control when this
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
money is being spent um we periodically
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
will get a statement from EPA saying
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
here is your bill for your next 10% we
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
pay the bill it is on their timetable um
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
um that they spend the funds on and we
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
um but we are mandated to keep this
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation here while um they're
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
getting to work on the new programs as
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
the commissioner said EPA is coming in
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
to do a what we understand to be an fair
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
amount of work on new what was the New
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plating former site so we're
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
hopeful that some of this match will be
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
used up in the next few
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
years the next section is um the LPS
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
extensions for the drink drinking water
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
srf program
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
um the way the program works is we are
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
required to provide our match upfront
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
but it often takes um with these federal
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
grants it takes us three to four years
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
to spend these funds down so when we
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
receive the
 
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
match um then we wait and then we
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
receive the Federal Grant and then it
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
takes us between three and four years to
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
spend that money down currently we're
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
spending on the 20 2 and 23 drinking
 
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
water funds we anticipate starting to
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
get through those um this fiscal year we
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
have been a little slow in spending the
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
match because we have had such a big
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
influx of arpa funds the last few years
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
and so our entire Focus has been on
 
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:16.839 align:start position:0%
getting the Opera funds out the door um
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
because essentially that's 100% Grant
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
and not alone to the communities um
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the drinking water and the um
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
clean water are loan programs
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
everybody likes free
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
money Y and if I could interject so also
 
01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:34.359 align:start position:0%
for those aren't who may not be familiar
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
with the state revolving Loan Fund so we
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
we don't the state just doesn't issue a
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
check and say have a nice day go do good
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
things uh drinking water or Wastewater
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
system uh this is the monies are
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
dispersed as the the system does its
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
does its work and we verify both the
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
engineering uh is in accordance with
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
what what was agreed to and uh in these
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
type of funds there's a lot of federal
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
Cross Cutters Davis bacon or by American
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
Steel Etc so there's a lot of double
 
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
checking so so these projects especially
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
when we get to the Clean Water projects
 
01:06:14.029 --> 01:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
take multiple years to to to go between
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
design and completion and we're again we
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
don't write a big check up front this is
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement as it as it happens so so
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's not actually out of the ordinary
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
that it takes multiple years to actually
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
move the the finally move the money uh
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
to these uh systems
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
so um on the next page are the two
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
sections related to clean water just
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
like drinking water revolving Loan
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
program the Clean Water program also has
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
the match and actually where we takes
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
between two and four years for drinking
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
water loans it's taking between three
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
and five years to fully disperse um the
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
clean water clean water loans
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
on the top of Page Three are the
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
sections um the extensions for the three
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
Dam repair and reconstruction um
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that we
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
have those approximately um of the $4
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
million that we had appropriated in 19
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
um we um are asking to pull the last
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
$61,000 forward um that is our old that
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
is the oldest um appropriation for Dam
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
repairs and reconstruction then the 21
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
and the 23 money um we are in the middle
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
of working I will say a lot of the 21
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
money we are using in concert were the
 
01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.190 align:start position:0%
money we are using in concert were the
arpa

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
arpa
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
funds um the 23 money which was a
 
01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:43.589 align:start position:0%
funds um the 23 money which was a
$750,000

01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
$750,000
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation um most of that money is
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
going to be going to the Israel River
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
ice control structure removal um we've
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
been a little slow in getting that off
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
because um as Cory said we had over $30
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
million in Opera funds and we've been
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
concentrating on the OPA
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
funds section um for the construction
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
facility um we have spent nearly um all
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
of that we have a small amount of money
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
left on that one excuse me my voice is
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
going um and we looking just continue
 
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
that so that we can finish spending the
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
balance of the funds um through the
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
summer of
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
25 um the oap Lake Dam um for that one
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
we have um most of that remaining funds
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
is um currently encumbered under um
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
engineering contracts and we have
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
anticipated final repairs of $43,000
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
left we hope to get through this summer
 
01:08:46.679 --> 01:08:53.669 align:start position:0%
left we hope to get through this summer
and

01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
fall on page
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
P um four is the Suncook River um what
 
01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
is left is the $14,000 appropriation
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
that is in cupboard um that we are using
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
um with a con Construction contract with
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
f Marl to um do any La um emergency
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
repairs as a result of any spring
 
01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
flooding that causes additional damage
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so that contract goes out through 28
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be spending that
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
14,000 through the end of
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
28 um the next three sections deal with
 
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.229 align:start position:0%
28 um the next three sections deal with
it

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:32.239 --> 01:09:34.030 align:start position:0%
it
upgrades

01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
upgrades
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
um Das and doit have contracted with
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
Windsor solutions to provide um DS with
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
a new comprehensive e- permitting
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
management system this will get nearly
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
all of our permits online um and get us
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
off our Legacy
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
databases we have um currently more than
 
01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
half of this money under current
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
contract and we anticipate getting the
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
balance of it under contract in the next
 
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.470 align:start position:0%
balance of it under contract in the next
12

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
12
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
months on page five are the um wiip
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
basaki River base
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
improvements um these I will admit are
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
as our oldest
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um we are currently as
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner said we have requested
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
$19.7 million in the current budget and
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
um we are using that plus all of these
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
funds that we have carried forward um to
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
do a major list of upgrades to the Winn
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
basaki Basin um there's a lot of work
 
01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done on this nearly 50y
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
old system and um we are working very
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
hard to upgrade the Franklin facility
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
the pumps the sewer
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
system um
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
page on page six is our Coastal flood
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
modeling um these funds are nearly are
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
all fully under
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
encumbrance um the vendor has had a few
 
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
issues getting equipment in the door and
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
um they had a failure with one of their
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
data sets so this money is filling
 
01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
cumbered but we expect it to be fully
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
spent sometime this
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
summer and then the last section is on
 
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
the groundwater to monitoring this is
 
01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
for upgrading our monitoring welds um so
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
that we can understand in drought
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
situations where we stand we have spent
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
approximately half those funds um we are
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of putting out a
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
contract for the balance of these funds
 
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
to work on um upgrading the rest of our
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
new monitoring Wells throughout the
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
state and on the last page on page eight
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
I had um two Corrections AGB
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
25 um we wanted to delete a section on
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
permitting um which is the laps
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
extension there was about $4,000 left we
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
fully expect to spend those funds of
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
this year so we do not need a laps
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
extension and then um there is a small
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
error in the Waki appropriation for
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
2627 there is a reference to the
 
01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
replacement fund and RSA
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
48551 the it should not be the
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
replacement fund and it should the
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
51 any question any questions
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative Jack yeah so that that
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
last correction that was mentioned is on
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
page two line
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
two and then uh we'll delete Number 96
 
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
at their request everything else cross
 
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
checks once
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
again we have any further questions for
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
DS seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:19.510 align:start position:0%
DS seeing none thank you very much for
your

01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
presentation

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
um we have the adant here does anybody
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
want to take a little five minute break
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
or not or should we just
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
well that's correct
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
all right moving forward to the
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
veteran services for the capital budget
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
welcome General thanks sir for the
 
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
record Mr chair and committee members
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm Major General David mtis the agent
 
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
general for the New Hampshire National
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
Guard commissioner uh Department of
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
and with me here today is Judy Chen our
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
Chief Financial Officer so i' like to
 
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
discuss like three broad things one is
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
the current fi Fiscal Federal landscape
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
number two is budget requests that
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
weren't in the governor's recommended
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
budget third piece is to address some of
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
the changes in um language we'd like to
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
address for a prior capital budget
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
Appropriations then fourth is obviously
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions may have so the
 
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
first part of it is um the current
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
federal uh fiscal landscape is currently
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
changing significantly right we are
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
currently under a continuing resolution
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
we anticipate a full continued re
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
resolution for the rest of this Federal
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um which sometimes sometimes
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
we'll hamper and limit our budget
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so we typically have to
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
compete amongst the 54 states and
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
territories for your equivalent of
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
federal dollars what we call military
 
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.149 align:start position:0%
federal dollars what we call military
construction

01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
dollars so when you look at our number
 
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
one priority uh it is a Plymouth Armory
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
a Readiness Center think of it like this
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the competition we facing this
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
Federal fesal uh Federal Federal uh
 
01:16:03.679 --> 01:16:04.830 align:start position:0%
Federal fesal uh Federal Federal uh
fiscal

01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
landscape out of the 54 states and
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
territories there are over 2,000
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
armories Across the Nation and only four
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
are being funded for new construction
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
and we are one of those
 
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
four right that tells you the
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
significant stress on our armories we
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
have about approximately 20 armories in
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
18 communities across the state the
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
challenge for us is how do you sort of
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
recapitalize armies that date back to
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
1880 1932 and invol majority of them in
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
the 1950s Cold War era we only have
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
three new armories in the last 20 years
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
our headquarters building and conquered
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
a new Readiness Center in Pembrook and
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
in addition to our conquered uh our
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
Aviation facility this Plymouth Armory
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
is a big deal so why is it a big deal in
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
2019 we became the department of
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services so
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
we were trying to demolish our exist in
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
Armory on Plymouth College Plymouth
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
State tear down and build a two brand
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
new two-story Armory what we want to
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
include in that is on the uh State side
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
of it is a uh veteran service officer uh
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
office and a veteran student lounge you
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
know service member for a life is a
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
Demas priority of taking care of our
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
service members throughout their
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
Continuum of um service whether they're
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
currently serving or those that are
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
veteran population having an Armory
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
centralized sort of in the mid-north
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
country on a college campus is
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
invaluable to us it slid on what we call
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the fight the president's future years
 
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
defense plan because it slid to the
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
right in a future outy year which is now
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
Federal fiscal year 27 we all know like
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
with home construction the cost of
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
construction has gone up we need
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
additional money which we requested Last
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
by Anum to make sure we can fill the
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
full square footage of that building
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
without there will be in a detriment and
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have to do sort of bid adjustments
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
a year and a half from now when we do
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
this bid opening and we want to build
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
this new facility that's why it's our
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
number one priority and that's why it's
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
a it's a 7525 federal state cost share
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
$3 million Federal $1 million state
 
01:18:03.199 --> 01:18:04.310 align:start position:0%
$3 million Federal $1 million state
general

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
funds when you look at the next two
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
projects on our list uh we leverage
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
significantly our Congressional
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
Delegation to get uh or receive
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
congressionally directed spending
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
projects they're huge it's a way for us
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
to sort of um you know leverage
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
additional funds on behalf of our
 
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
service members these two projects here
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
were requested in federal fiscal year 24
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
and again in this Federal fiscal year
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're both 100% fredly reimbursed um
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
they emitted from the governor's
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
recommended budget and we are here to
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
Advocate on behalf of them again they're
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
both 100% feather re URS it's in
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
addition to our Plymouth Readiness
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
Center which is relatively new but we
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
had to put more service members in that
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
building to take care of uh overcrowding
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
and other older facilities and then the
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
third one down on the list is a uh
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
Aviation hanger
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
facility so we're fortunate to get to
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
additional helicopters in our inventory
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
we're now up to 12 we have two black uh
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
two Lakota uh helicopters which are
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
relatively new for the last 6 months and
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
we have 10 blackhaw helicopters because
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
of those new helicopters we don't have
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
hanger space to put them in it's 100%
 
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
fly reimburse project we we are pursuing
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
a congressionally directed spending
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
project so generally what we need is
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're getting the federal dollars we
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
just need the state checkbook to put the
 
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
money into that's why these two are
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
relatively important for us so that
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
explains the three projects that were
 
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
not included in the governor's
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
recommended budget if you go to page six
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
and seven I believe in your handout is
 
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
it that house
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill within House Bill 25 you'll see we
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
change the language of a couple of
 
01:19:45.149 --> 01:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
projects generally speaking they're 100%
 
01:19:45.159 --> 01:19:46.310 align:start position:0%
projects generally speaking they're 100%
fed

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
fed
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursed they are associated with
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
congressionally directed spending
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
projects ear marks that we have received
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
from Congress and we're just titing up
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
the language to ensure that we can
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
receive the money in the right pot of
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
the right pot of money and their right
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation 100% Federal no
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
significant changes other than the fact
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
that we just want to ensure that the
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire dmas can accept
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
this money from the federal government
 
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
facilities so we talked about the
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
changing Federal landscape our three
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
additions to the governor's recommended
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
budget the text that we Chang for two or
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
three Appropriations in previous house
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
bills um subject to your questions
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all I
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
questions seriously
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay I just if I if I might just provide
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
a clarification what the uh General is
 
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
asking for is to basically change the
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
titles of a couple of previously
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
approved projects so he doesn't want to
 
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
use it for the purpose it was derived
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
for originally he just wants to have it
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
broaden to a different purpose and they
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
provided language in two instances for
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
that so that's not something that has
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
been changed yet it they're asking to
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
have that change
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
made that would be
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
seven it would be the Pembroke RTI
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
upgrades and the uh so what they're
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
asking to have happen there is that the
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
two projects in the first table one was
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
anti-terrorism um Force protection the
 
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
other was energy res resiliency and
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency improvements to change the
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
titles to those two projects which were
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
100% federally funded to be the Pembrook
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
um RTI
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
upgrade and then on the last page is a
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
believe from the marac county facility
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
upgrades to the Stanford count
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay it's on page 7even yep so going
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
from the warehouse facility upgrades to
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
the military uh minor military conr
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
construction straford
 
01:21:59.470 --> 01:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
County so all it is is just a simple um
 
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
change in amending the prior capital
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
budget um titles with an amendment to
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
this capital budget if the committee
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
were to go forward with that questions
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
chairman so uh thank you General and all
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
the way um so these two budget items are
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
basically the same scope of work but
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're changing the titles and just make
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
sure I end understand that reason or is
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
it has the scop changed
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
significantly um sorry I should clarify
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
that thank you Chris
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
um we received money uh congressionally
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
directed spending project to do a solar
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
PV away array to cut down on our energy
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
consumption and so we have to change the
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
text it's the same location but sort of
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
a different purpose so
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I follow so can you
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
explain what the scope differences on
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
these couple of projects so we
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
understand that uh that would be
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate change it's just something
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
that I guess I would say that the
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
determination is that there's a bigger
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
priority now but the funding has already
 
01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
been allocated to you is that the case
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
it it's where we're successful in
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
getting federal funds so it's 100%
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
failure reimburse so in the first case
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
um it's the it's they're in the pemr
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
facility for the on page six and we were
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
successful in getting a congressional
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
directed spending
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
project in essence to changed to end do
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
improvements to antiterrorism force
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
protection like building standoff and
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
then also to do energy resiliency which
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
is a solar array outside of the building
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
versus improvements inside the building
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
thanks very
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
much and and then on page seven the
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
change was um uh we were unsuccessful in
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
acquiring a a build buing uh next to an
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
an Armory in Franklin which we're going
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
to do a warehouse expansion So what had
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
happened is um we actually got funding
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
to build a new fitness facility in
 
01:24:06.189 --> 01:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
Center straford again 100% fairly
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
reimburse we changed the location and
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
the purpose on that
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
one any further
 
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none would we like to
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
proceed is there any other changes to
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
any lapse requests or anything at
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
all uh no sir
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
further questions representative jur
 
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so am I
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
understanding this properly um General
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're not going to do the uh
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
resiliency and efficiency improvements
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
instead with that
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
funding we are uh a little bit it's more
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
of a function of trying to create the
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
language to incorporate sort of um the
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
solar PBR aray outside of the building
 
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
that will have secondary impacts of the
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
resiliency on the inside of the
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
building okay so you're you're trying to
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
match the title with the scope yes thank
 
01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
you you're quite welcome
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
um further
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
questions so if I'm correct uh so your
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
your presentation actually wouldn't even
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
cover anything that you've already got
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's approval for we've just
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
talked about the three additional ones
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
that you would like okay and if if I can
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
sum it up uh you're only only asking for
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
a million dooll upgrade request because
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
the rest is all federal
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
funds would that be fair yes
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
sir thank you further
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:25:45.199 --> 01:25:50.830 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
much

01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
General and uh
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Shay do we need any updates from you
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh unless the I mean I can talk about
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
the email I sent this uh Friday related
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
to the safety came back with their yes
 
01:26:06.239 --> 01:26:07.669 align:start position:0%
to the safety came back with their yes
please

01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
um plate so when they came in and talked
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
to you last week they had a project that
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
they were requesting that wasn't part of
 
01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
the capital budget which was to buy
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
equipment for the platem purposes it was
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
a um $2.3 million project almost $2.4
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
million project they wanted to use on
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
general fund Appropriations to do that
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
um you would ask them to go back and to
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
um get information on how they come up
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
with that dollar amount in doing so um
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
one of the vendors they spoke with said
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the production
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
capacity that you currently have um you
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to buy two pieces of of
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
equipment in each case you would only
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
need one so basically cut the price in
 
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
half to about $1.3
 
01:26:52.109 --> 01:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
million in doing so there's a dedicated
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
fund it's called the reflectorized plate
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
fund fund which is used as a revolving
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
fund that pays for all the materials and
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the plates that
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
are issued to the citizens of New
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so they believe that fund
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
would be able to cover any Debt Service
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
as long as the project stay around the
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
$1.3 million so it would be in other
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
funded uh projects similar to what
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
you've seen with fishing game where they
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
had uh their Debt Service being paid is
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
from the fishing game fund this debt
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
service will be paid from the
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
reflectorized plate fund
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
um so that would be up to the committee
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
and whether it was something that you
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
thought was appropriate um I did confirm
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
with the Department to make sure that
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
they The Debt Service could be paid um
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing it wasn't just a oneandone in
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
terms of uh you know that it would be
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we get the money this by any but we
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't know about next by they just feel
 
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
with the revenue that they bring in it
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient to cover the ongoing
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
Debt Service for the new M
 
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
Machinery so next next week when we
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
actually start on our work sessions on
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
I think I would recommend that we take a
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
hard look at including this money it's
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
not going to be any bonding money it
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
won't increase anything that we have to
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
go out and borrow and uh we can
 
01:28:09.109 --> 01:28:09.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully add add an item for a change
 
01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
instead of taking them away
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative kazinski so nice to not
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
so so the commissioner um I think at
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
that time and when I talk to them
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
offline um they're looking at
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
Alternatives so it may continue in the
 
01:28:39.629 --> 01:28:39.639 align:start position:0%
prison system in terms of the plate
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
making it may not it depends on um the
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
type of Machinery that they're going to
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
get and um if they could work with the
 
01:28:49.629 --> 01:28:49.639 align:start position:0%
vendor to actually be the producer the
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
corrections uh Department would still do
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
the decals they would do all the
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
printing related to that but it would be
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
just the plates themselves they might
 
01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
not but that's a question that they
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
haven't answered at the department yet
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
they're still looking at what they might
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
do in the long
 
01:29:04.159 --> 01:29:19.350 align:start position:0%
do in the long
term

01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
followups

01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
followups
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
um so they pay the Department of
 
01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.750 align:start position:0%
um so they pay the Department of
Corrections

01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
for the service that's provided so they
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
would still have a an expenditure it
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
just not might not be going to the
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and that money
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
that goes to the Department of
 
01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
Corrections goes into their um
 
01:29:37.239 --> 01:29:40.270 align:start position:0%
Corrections goes into their um
industrial

01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
um okay I'm not going to get the name
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
completely right but their industrial
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
program has a dedicated fund that is
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
used to help fund that that um projects
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
there um so they wouldn't get that
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
anymore if they weren't doing the plate
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
the plates themselves they would
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
continue to get the decals and the
 
01:29:58.510 --> 01:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
printing but they may not get the plates
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
and again that's a question that the
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner didn't commit one way or
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
the other yet when I tried to um ask
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
that question of
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
him um just looking forward to
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday a week from tomorrow uh
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
when we we're gonna have the public
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
hearing first for a half hour and then
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
we'll start into our work session uh are
 
01:30:21.629 --> 01:30:21.639 align:start position:0%
you going to have our little comparison
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
worksheets for us um could you also if
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
you can't make it part of it give us a
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
like a mini breakdown of all the
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh dollars for the extra requests and
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
will we will will we have a
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh a dollar total of where we're getting
 
01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
all the laps money
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question yes um and
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
I've been keeping a tab on what agencies
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
are asking um if it would be helpful for
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
the committee and it's okay with the
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
chairs things like the um plate
 
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
reflectorized plate I could actually
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
have an amendment drafted so that people
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
could actually have a piece of paper and
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
see what's happening versus the
 
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
conversation the understanding of what's
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
happening with the requests that the
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
Adit General had in terms of the
 
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
repurposing of the titles I mean I could
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
have an amendment drafted so you could
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
see that on on um Tuesday next week um
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
that way you it's understood a little
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
bit easier for people it's the the
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
mechanics involved um and it may help
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
with questions and and the committee
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
making decisions how how are we looking
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
with all our budget line number items
 
01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
for laps have you been keeping up with
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
that well you got a a big chunk today
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
which was the Department of Corrections
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
and prior to that it was just just about
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 I think um we're still waiting
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
on HHS uh they were going to get back to
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
us and we get the
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
157,000 I think from
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
judicial yep yeah that was a project
 
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
that is isn't going forward so it's not
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
new money but you could repurpose it for
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
something else yeah just so everybody
 
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
knows my intent is the governor came in
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
at at 143 normally we come in
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
here we get 130 135 is each year and we
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
having said that we will normally have
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
about 50 to 60 items that we can pick
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
not pick and choose from but that we can
 
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
trim we can add to things like that
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have 50 and 60 items
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
on this budget so this is going to be
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
very tight I I'd like to set a goal of
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get it in at about 133 as
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to 143 but we we've have we've
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
got some needs and and it might not just
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
be possible so our my intent on the
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
first day is to go for all the lwh
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit to see what what we can
 
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
cut what what's just what everybody
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
agrees to uh there won't be any formal
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
votes we I've went through all my
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
paperwork from last year we we do
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
nothing but straw poles we just figure
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
out until we're ready to act on the
 
01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
out until we're ready to act on the
final

01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
hb25 so that's what we're up and in line
 
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
for and uh Mr chair representative CL
 
01:33:26.910 --> 01:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
quickly next week so next week we're
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
going to have a formal public hearing
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is that correct a formal public
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
hearing for a half hour and what we've
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
been having the last few couple days
 
01:33:37.709 --> 01:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
last week and this week is presentations
 
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
by the agencies on their requests corre
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
but at this hearing like you're the
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
prime prime sponsor so you will present
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
it I'll present the bill yeah and it'll
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
be a chance for uh supporters of the
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget to testify or if there's
 
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
any opponents or more members of the
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
public if they have suggestions to
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
improve it but what we've been doing is
 
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
more of the agency presentations correct
 
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
which I believe fi Finance is doing
 
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
certain something similar with the
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
operating budget okay I just want to
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%

03:02:18.830 --> 03:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon being 1:00 back let's
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
continue the afternoon session of the
 
03:02:23.190 --> 03:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
presentations for the Governor's capital
 
03:02:25.309 --> 03:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
budget we will now welcome the
 
03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation William
 
03:02:31.110 --> 03:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
Cass welcome to public
 
03:02:33.510 --> 03:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
works thank you Mr chair uh for the
 
03:02:35.229 --> 03:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
record William Cass commissioner new
 
03:02:37.389 --> 03:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
hamper Dot and with me is Danielle
 
03:02:44.750 --> 03:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:46.870 --> 03:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
Finance so I don't know if you have an
 
03:02:50.830 --> 03:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
order to start with uh or um we can we
 
03:02:52.670 --> 03:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
we have go ahead with your presentation
 
03:02:55.070 --> 03:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
we I've talked with representative Jack
 
03:02:58.309 --> 03:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh probably not have to
 
03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
go over line by line when we get to your
 
03:03:02.910 --> 03:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
laps extensions we'll we'll probably be
 
03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
good with that so just uh just your
 
03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
Capital project requests very good
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you so I have a book you
 
03:03:12.429 --> 03:03:12.439 align:start position:0%
should all have um for the hb25 capital
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
budget requests and I'm going to talk
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
primarily off the first page which has
 
03:03:21.309 --> 03:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
an index of the project uh
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
requests and just for the record and and
 
03:03:26.349 --> 03:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
I I believe some of you are familiar but
 
03:03:30.429 --> 03:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
um we we typically break our um capital
 
03:03:34.110 --> 03:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
budget requests into uh two categories
 
03:03:38.870 --> 03:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
based on the funding mix so uh the top
 
03:03:42.349 --> 03:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
portion of that index of that summary is
 
03:03:46.750 --> 03:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
relative to uh General funded um uh
 
03:03:48.229 --> 03:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
capital budget request
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
which primarily deal with um
 
03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics uh um Rail and Transit those
 
03:03:58.750 --> 03:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
are G General funded areas of the
 
03:04:03.710 --> 03:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
department on the bottom half of that um
 
03:04:06.990 --> 03:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
summary are the capital budget requests
 
03:04:11.790 --> 03:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
for the highway fund uh for for Highway
 
03:04:13.830 --> 03:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
funded capital budget items and that is
 
03:04:18.269 --> 03:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
generally our um our um Highway
 
03:04:20.590 --> 03:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
Maintenance and the
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
do uh own facilities uh involved with
 
03:04:26.429 --> 03:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
the the maintenance of the highway and
 
03:04:28.349 --> 03:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
those are Highway funded so we usually
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
keep them separated and split out that
 
03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
way when we originally presented to the
 
03:04:36.309 --> 03:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh for the Governor's budget submission
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
it was a ranked priority of all of them
 
03:04:41.429 --> 03:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
together so as we get into some of the
 
03:04:45.190 --> 03:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
um some of the details some of those
 
03:04:47.790 --> 03:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
priority numbers uh are a little off
 
03:04:50.229 --> 03:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
because they were all lumped together uh
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
and in
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
the approximately 9 months since we
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
originally compr put together our
 
03:04:58.510 --> 03:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget we've we've looked harder
 
03:05:00.429 --> 03:05:00.439 align:start position:0%
at the priorities and stuff as well too
 
03:05:02.429 --> 03:05:02.439 align:start position:0%
so this is current to what we're
 
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
requesting today so let me start with
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
the top piece of that uh talking about
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
the general fund uh capital budget
 
03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
requests so the governor's uh capital
 
03:05:16.349 --> 03:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
budget request capital budget re uh
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
funded one fund item for the Department
 
03:05:23.630 --> 03:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
$390 for the FTA uh Transit match for
 
03:05:27.309 --> 03:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
the for the state match to help support
 
03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
FTA uh funded F FTA is Federal Transit
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
Authority um Revenue Vehicles so these
 
03:05:38.190 --> 03:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
are federal funds that that we
 
03:05:42.910 --> 03:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
um um that we use to fund local or
 
03:05:45.070 --> 03:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
Community Transit uh
 
03:05:47.630 --> 03:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and there is some State m
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
match associated with that about
 
03:05:53.389 --> 03:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
$390,000 and that was funded so on page
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
one and page two and page three of the
 
03:05:59.469 --> 03:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
book uh and I won't go into details it
 
03:06:01.830 --> 03:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
is there but there is um you know the
 
03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
summary of why it's
 
03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
necessary what it's going to and on page
 
03:06:10.750 --> 03:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
three in particular is a list of the
 
03:06:13.710 --> 03:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
anticipated um vehicles that that
 
03:06:18.349 --> 03:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
funding will help um will help Fund in
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
the next
 
03:06:24.590 --> 03:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
bium um so that information is is there
 
03:06:26.349 --> 03:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
in in front of
 
03:06:29.349 --> 03:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
you moving on I'm going to get to then
 
03:06:33.670 --> 03:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
the uh couple of areas um that that we
 
03:06:35.670 --> 03:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
had previously requested but weren't
 
03:06:38.030 --> 03:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
funded in the governor's budget and the
 
03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
first one being um the state match for
 
03:06:45.990 --> 03:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
Federal Aviation
 
03:06:48.670 --> 03:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
projects um
 
03:06:51.469 --> 03:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
historically the uh the state capital
 
03:06:55.870 --> 03:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
budget has funded uh the 5% match of of
 
03:06:59.550 --> 03:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
the FAA funds that go to um State
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
airports state federal um federally
 
03:07:02.479 --> 03:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
airports state federal um federally
funded

03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
funded
 
03:07:07.110 --> 03:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
airports um so these FAA projects the
 
03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
typically the typical match is 90%
 
03:07:14.190 --> 03:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
federal funds 5% State funds and St 5%
 
03:07:19.269 --> 03:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
local or Community funds um
 
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
we if you look on page um let me get to
 
03:07:28.190 --> 03:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
that you look at at page F page five uh
 
03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
the sheet that went along with that our
 
03:07:37.950 --> 03:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
original budget ask was about $4.7
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
million since that time we have looked
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
harder and we had the actual FY 24
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
actuals in in hand so um we've revised
 
03:07:51.309 --> 03:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
the request to be about $3.6 million
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
General funds that would leverage about
 
03:07:58.110 --> 03:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
$65 million of uh Federal Aviation funds
 
03:08:01.510 --> 03:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
that go to um around 40 or so projects
 
03:08:04.229 --> 03:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
within the state working on State uh
 
03:08:08.229 --> 03:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
airport assets um and on
 
03:08:08.239 --> 03:08:10.630 align:start position:0%
airport assets um and on
page

03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:08:18.269 --> 03:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
um 11 and 12 of of the um
 
03:08:21.469 --> 03:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
of the book there are two sheets one for
 
03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
FY 26 one for FY 27 that is a a list of
 
03:08:29.590 --> 03:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
the um of the projects that would be
 
03:08:33.429 --> 03:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
done with this funding in the next uh
 
03:08:37.750 --> 03:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
bium so the need for this is
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh is really for uh to help leverage
 
03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
these federal funds uh historically we
 
03:08:47.150 --> 03:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
have always funded a 5% match it has
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
gone a long way toward accessing the FAA
 
03:08:52.349 --> 03:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
funds necessary for these airport
 
03:08:52.359 --> 03:08:53.389 align:start position:0%
funds necessary for these airport
capital

03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
capital
 
03:08:56.990 --> 03:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
projects um most of these projects deal
 
03:09:00.429 --> 03:09:00.439 align:start position:0%
with uh safety improvements to the
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
airports as well as infrastructure
 
03:09:04.630 --> 03:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
improvements mainly infrastructure
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance and upkeep state of good
 
03:09:11.389 --> 03:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
repair um so we would ask for
 
03:09:12.790 --> 03:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
consideration of that again
 
03:09:14.910 --> 03:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
traditionally it has historically been
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
the way these uh uh projects have been
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
funded one other
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's an odity but one
 
03:09:29.830 --> 03:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
one other uh aspect of this I guess is
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
that those $65 million of federal funds
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
they do flow through the capital budget
 
03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have those budgeted elsewhere
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
in our operational budget again
 
03:09:42.429 --> 03:09:42.439 align:start position:0%
historically um because they are Capital
 
03:09:45.190 --> 03:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
Improvements uh the the the federal
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
funds have have flowed through
 
03:09:49.790 --> 03:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
um the capital budget along with the
 
03:09:49.800 --> 03:09:52.389 align:start position:0%
um the capital budget along with the
state

03:09:52.389 --> 03:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:54.670 --> 03:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
match and if there are any questions as
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
I go along please please go ahead and
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
stop I'll just I'll just keep going in
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh u in absence of any questions I do
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
want to be respectful of the commit
 
03:10:09.870 --> 03:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
time the uh the next two uh priorities
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
for us on the general fund sign deal
 
03:10:15.309 --> 03:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
with investment or um maintenance and
 
03:10:18.229 --> 03:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
repair along state-owned owned uh
 
03:10:18.239 --> 03:10:19.550 align:start position:0%
repair along state-owned owned uh
railroad

03:10:19.550 --> 03:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
03:10:19.560 --> 03:10:22.070 align:start position:0%
railroad
facilities

03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:10:24.990 --> 03:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
um we are looking for and this is a this
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
is an area of really kind of
 
03:10:29.439 --> 03:10:31.550 align:start position:0%
is an area of really kind of
historic

03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
historic
 
03:10:37.309 --> 03:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
um lack of investment um State owns
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
about uh 450 miles of railroad
 
03:10:45.550 --> 03:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
track uh we have 163 active miles that
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
typically facilitate tourist EXC
 
03:10:51.030 --> 03:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
Excursion and Freight rail
 
03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
Excursion and Freight rail
Services

03:10:52.630 --> 03:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:10:55.389 --> 03:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
um the rail along these state owned
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
quarters has seen substantial wear um so
 
03:11:01.870 --> 03:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
part of this part of this budget request
 
03:11:05.309 --> 03:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
is to have a systematic way of um
 
03:11:07.590 --> 03:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
investing in upgrading and trying to
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
bring some of those um quarters uh up to
 
03:11:16.870 --> 03:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
an industry standard 115 pound rail um
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
on on within the within the um book on
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
page um 15 14 and
 
03:11:30.110 --> 03:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
15 um you can see uh there's a little
 
03:11:32.670 --> 03:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
bit more detail about why the why this
 
03:11:35.550 --> 03:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
project is necessary but it also shows
 
03:11:37.710 --> 03:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
the wear and tear that we are finding on
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
the state-owned uh rail facilities so
 
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
this has been a historic this been an
 
03:11:46.990 --> 03:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
area of long deferred maintenance and um
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
it releas some funding to uh uh
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
systematically get through uh starting
 
03:11:55.990 --> 03:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
to address these State assets is what
 
03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:56.950 align:start position:0%
to address these State assets is what
we're

03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:11:56.960 --> 03:11:58.510 align:start position:0%
we're
requesting

03:11:58.510 --> 03:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
03:12:02.469 --> 03:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
um similarly P priority three is is very
 
03:12:05.429 --> 03:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
similar uh replacement of of railroad
 
03:12:10.190 --> 03:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
ties we do a um very limited amount of
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
just trying to keep the rails in
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
service um but um another um part of
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
this funding to go along with uh some
 
03:12:23.550 --> 03:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
investment in our state-owned rail
 
03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
corridors and keep them in service many
 
03:12:28.590 --> 03:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
of these railroad ties were installed in
 
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
dates ranging from the 1920s to the
 
03:12:35.550 --> 03:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
1950s um they are deteriorated ties that
 
03:12:37.630 --> 03:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
can't support vertical loads and the and
 
03:12:41.429 --> 03:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
the and the use that's there today and
 
03:12:44.830 --> 03:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh they continue to they continue to uh
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
so those are that those are the ones
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
that we would really uh like
 
03:12:57.229 --> 03:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
consideration of we have a several other
 
03:13:00.630 --> 03:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
ones that uh again fall below the line
 
03:13:03.630 --> 03:13:03.640 align:start position:0%
priority five and six for um abandoned
 
03:13:06.830 --> 03:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
railroad Corridor repairs and uh Transit
 
03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
match for um Transit uh facility
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
buildings but those are lower priority
 
03:13:16.550 --> 03:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
um but I would ask for consideration for
 
03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
for the for the top three of our
 
03:13:22.349 --> 03:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
unfunded um priorities the uh State
 
03:13:25.349 --> 03:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
match for the FAA projects and the FAA
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds and the two uh railroad
 
03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:31.630 align:start position:0%
federal funds and the two uh railroad
repair

03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.269 --> 03:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
items and if there aren't any questions
 
03:13:36.150 --> 03:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
on that yet
 
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
um represent
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
voger thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:13:45.389 --> 03:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question on the
 
03:13:52.550 --> 03:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:56.229 --> 03:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
um how much would that approximately $2
 
03:14:00.990 --> 03:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
million uh cover in replacement of the
 
03:14:02.229 --> 03:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
you said we
 
03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
have 63 163 active miles yes and how
 
03:14:11.190 --> 03:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
many of the 163 active miles would that
 
03:14:15.389 --> 03:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
help out so that uh 1.9 million would
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
would uh purchase about 4 track miles of
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
rail um and systematically replacing
 
03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
that and we would focus that on the on
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
the on the worst areas of rail in the in
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
the areas that have the most frequent
 
03:14:30.670 --> 03:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
use right now we would Target it for
 
03:14:34.030 --> 03:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
areas of the um Conway Scenic Railroad
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
which um the mountain division um up up
 
03:14:39.229 --> 03:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
in that
 
03:14:43.309 --> 03:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
area followup please follow
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
up how many of the 163 mil house is in
 
03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
need or carries the 85
 
03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
pound uh
 
03:14:56.750 --> 03:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
rail uh I'm not I'm not sure I'm gonna
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
ask if anybody behind me if uh our
 
03:15:00.630 --> 03:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
director do you know
 
03:15:04.269 --> 03:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
Shelly yeah Mo most of it probably but
 
03:15:07.469 --> 03:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
uh it's probably been through
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
any um maintenance type of repairs that
 
03:15:12.229 --> 03:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
that it would have been different from
 
03:15:16.030 --> 03:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
the 85 PB rail to the 115 PB rail
 
03:15:18.429 --> 03:15:18.439 align:start position:0%
representative kazinsky
 
03:15:20.349 --> 03:15:20.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:15:22.870 --> 03:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
taking my questions I have a few
 
03:15:25.389 --> 03:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
questions if you don't mind so the
 
03:15:27.670 --> 03:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
location you don't have a set location
 
03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
on on this repair
 
03:15:32.469 --> 03:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
then not specifically we would Target
 
03:15:36.990 --> 03:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
the the the most um the most um area
 
03:15:39.309 --> 03:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
most disrepair but I know we would focus
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
it on the on the U Mountain division
 
03:15:43.189 --> 03:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
branch is that right Shel do you have a
 
03:15:44.910 --> 03:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
specific area yes this is Shelley
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
Winters our director of Aeronautics rail
 
03:15:49.670 --> 03:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
Transit so uh we were targeting the the
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
Conway the section that Conway cck
 
03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
operates tourist Excursion on on the
 
03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
state owned Mountain division we have
 
03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
the exact mile poost to mile poost we
 
03:15:59.870 --> 03:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
can um give that to the committee if
 
03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's helpful but again tourist Excursion
 
03:16:04.510 --> 03:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
brings about 75% of the revenue into the
 
03:16:06.630 --> 03:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
state brings for the the special
 
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
railroad fund and as well as brings a
 
03:16:10.830 --> 03:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
lot of Tourism into the state in general
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
so we're targeting that that's the most
 
03:16:14.990 --> 03:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
willfully um in need of Maintenance
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
right now is the section com SE runs
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
up so does any uh is any of it uh rail
 
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
is used by the freight companies the
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
private freight companies that use the
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
rail right now there would just be a
 
03:16:32.790 --> 03:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of through Freight on there
 
03:16:34.910 --> 03:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
that line and the section that Conway
 
03:16:37.510 --> 03:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
Scenic um is a tenant Railroad on is
 
03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
looking to bring more Freight in we're
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
looking for coexistence of Freight in
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
tourist Excursion railroad so it's to
 
03:16:45.229 --> 03:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
accommodate the current use safely to
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
move people and then to accommodate
 
03:16:50.349 --> 03:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
Freight in the near
 
03:16:52.750 --> 03:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
term okay because I was hearing about an
 
03:16:54.910 --> 03:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
investment and I was wondering like how
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
much we receive the state receives in in
 
03:17:01.389 --> 03:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
rent or cost covering our cost
 
03:17:03.269 --> 03:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
cooperating agreements with with them I
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
don't so tourist Excursion railroads um
 
03:17:08.710 --> 03:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
provide 20% of their gross operating 10%
 
03:17:10.590 --> 03:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
is a user fee paid to the state and to
 
03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
the special railroad fund and a minimum
 
03:17:16.429 --> 03:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
of 10% goes into maintenance of the
 
03:17:19.229 --> 03:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
trackage that they um essentially have
 
03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
they lease from us so do the freight
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
rails pay anything Freight rail pays 5%
 
03:17:27.150 --> 03:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
user fee to the state and 20% of their
 
03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
gross operating for maintenance so it's
 
03:17:31.750 --> 03:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
a 25% net gross operating for Freight
 
03:17:37.469 --> 03:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
Excursion yeah and again that yields to
 
03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
the special railroad Fund in the form of
 
03:17:43.349 --> 03:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
user fees about
 
03:17:46.150 --> 03:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
$700,000 a year that we reinvest through
 
03:17:47.870 --> 03:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
the special Railroad Fund in the state
 
03:17:52.349 --> 03:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
online so again 700,000 for dollars for
 
03:17:55.910 --> 03:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
200 miles of active track 163 miles
 
03:17:58.110 --> 03:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
which get used on a roughly a daily
 
03:18:00.110 --> 03:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
basis during peak season um is
 
03:18:01.950 --> 03:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
inadequate for our needs thus the
 
03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
you does that help I guess
 
03:18:13.870 --> 03:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
so any other
 
03:18:20.110 --> 03:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.110 --> 03:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the second the second
 
03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
section of our uh capital budget request
 
03:18:28.469 --> 03:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
is the highway fund uh section so um we
 
03:18:31.469 --> 03:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
had a number of prioritized requests uh
 
03:18:33.990 --> 03:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget only uh funded
 
03:18:36.189 --> 03:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
the the highest priority our top
 
03:18:39.510 --> 03:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
priority was for a annual project or a I
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
should say a biannual project banial
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
project to uh construct um construct uh
 
03:18:51.309 --> 03:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
sand and salt sheds so the dot we are a
 
03:18:55.189 --> 03:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide operation we have around 85 to
 
03:19:00.510 --> 03:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
90 uh Statewide facilities um Service uh
 
03:19:02.910 --> 03:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
within any any two or three towns
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
generally has a highway patrol shed
 
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
that's responsible for those um areas of
 
03:19:11.710 --> 03:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
State Highway usually each Patrol shed
 
03:19:14.870 --> 03:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
has several out buildings sand shed salt
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
shed um keep that those materials
 
03:19:22.110 --> 03:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
undercover so it's an ongoing constant
 
03:19:26.150 --> 03:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
um um basis of of trying to keep up with
 
03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
with the with the life of those needs so
 
03:19:32.590 --> 03:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
we have his have historically had a uh
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
um a banial project to um systematically
 
03:19:40.510 --> 03:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
keep up with the uh replacement of those
 
03:19:43.870 --> 03:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
older facilities sand and salt sheds and
 
03:19:48.110 --> 03:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
our top budget item here was was for a
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh $3 million fund fund uh funding
 
03:19:54.750 --> 03:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
request uh to continue that that effort
 
03:19:58.189 --> 03:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that $3 million will um
 
03:20:02.150 --> 03:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
address two to possibly three um
 
03:20:06.429 --> 03:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
facilities I will note that um this was
 
03:20:08.189 --> 03:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
our request I know when it came through
 
03:20:10.110 --> 03:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
the budget through the governor's
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
capital budget it got it got bumped up
 
03:20:15.229 --> 03:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
to about $4.6 million that's what you
 
03:20:17.070 --> 03:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
probably see in the capital budget item
 
03:20:21.429 --> 03:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
before you um we would we would propose
 
03:20:26.229 --> 03:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
capping it at this $3 million um level
 
03:20:28.269 --> 03:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh we will manage the projects we will
 
03:20:31.870 --> 03:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
manage the uh activities to that to that
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
level um within some of the um within
 
03:20:38.349 --> 03:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
some of the previous approved Capital
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
items are are are are um some residual
 
03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
funds that we will seek to bring forward
 
03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh to um continue to work and address
 
03:20:49.080 --> 03:20:51.910 align:start position:0%
uh to um continue to work and address
these

03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:55.189 --> 03:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
facilities that would leave you with uh
 
03:20:58.750 --> 03:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
1.65 million out of that original 4.6
 
03:21:02.710 --> 03:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you have uh projects
 
03:21:05.630 --> 03:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
identified yes continuing down the um
 
03:21:08.189 --> 03:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
continuing down the list of
 
03:21:11.590 --> 03:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
priorities um and I would say just as a
 
03:21:14.030 --> 03:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
as a preface to that one one thing
 
03:21:15.870 --> 03:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
you're right the the difference between
 
03:21:18.750 --> 03:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
that 4. and what we're requesting here
 
03:21:21.389 --> 03:21:21.399 align:start position:0%
um I will also point out that in our
 
03:21:24.110 --> 03:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
operating budget we had again this was
 
03:21:26.269 --> 03:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
done back uh last summer when we first
 
03:21:28.950 --> 03:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
did the capital budget request we have
 
03:21:31.750 --> 03:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted uh Debt Service in our
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget um Highway fund Debt
 
03:21:36.510 --> 03:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
Service that would support about $10
 
03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
million of capital uh investment so
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
where you see this line here drawn we
 
03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
have targeted our capital budget request
 
03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
toward that about $10 million limit
 
03:21:51.630 --> 03:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
because we do feel it is supported um by
 
03:21:54.750 --> 03:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
The Debt Service that we are budgeting
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
in our operating budget so um I put that
 
03:21:59.389 --> 03:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
out there for the committee's
 
03:22:01.229 --> 03:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
consideration as well
 
03:22:01.239 --> 03:22:04.389 align:start position:0%
consideration as well
too

03:22:04.389 --> 03:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so the second um so the second
 
03:22:10.189 --> 03:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
priority there would be uh very similar
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
to uh the sand and salt sheds would be a
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
$2 million banial investment in
 
03:22:18.229 --> 03:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
Statewide wide underground fuel tank
 
03:22:20.110 --> 03:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
Replacements I had mentioned about the
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
85 to 90 facilities around the state uh
 
03:22:26.429 --> 03:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
not only do they have uh sand and salt
 
03:22:28.870 --> 03:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
sheds most of those have some sort of
 
03:22:31.870 --> 03:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
fueling capacity um whether it's diesel
 
03:22:38.469 --> 03:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
or diesel and and and gas um and we uh
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
again it's a constant investment to keep
 
03:22:43.189 --> 03:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
up to code to keep up uh to keeping good
 
03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
graces with our Dees permitting for
 
03:22:47.469 --> 03:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
these these
 
03:22:50.550 --> 03:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
facilities um so this $2 million would
 
03:22:52.510 --> 03:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
go to reconstruction of the oldest and
 
03:22:54.070 --> 03:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the highest risk storage and
 
03:22:57.510 --> 03:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
Distribution Systems Statewide um we
 
03:23:01.550 --> 03:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
have four or five um higher priority
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
facilities in the pictures
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
are of those facilities are you know
 
03:23:12.510 --> 03:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
shown in the um in the budget request
 
03:23:14.990 --> 03:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
book on page 34 and 35 just to give you
 
03:23:19.229 --> 03:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
a sense of of of where uh and uh we
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
would Target those Investments and some
 
03:23:25.630 --> 03:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
pictures of of what those existing um
 
03:23:28.429 --> 03:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
dated facilities uh look like so you can
 
03:23:30.189 --> 03:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
see some of the ones that we're looking
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
at uh replacing or rehabilitating are
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
are one are facilities that are 35 36
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
years old um and in quite a bit of Need
 
03:23:46.990 --> 03:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
moving um along the next highest
 
03:23:53.030 --> 03:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
priority uh priority number three uh
 
03:23:56.269 --> 03:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's about $1.2 million to uh replace
 
03:23:59.630 --> 03:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
the garage roof on our Twin Mountain
 
03:24:03.910 --> 03:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
shed um again that is an older shed the
 
03:24:06.429 --> 03:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
roof has been in
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
um um disrepair for some time uh it is a
 
03:24:15.269 --> 03:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
much older facility um the current roof
 
03:24:15.279 --> 03:24:16.910 align:start position:0%
much older facility um the current roof
design

03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
design
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh back in the 70s when we were doing
 
03:24:22.469 --> 03:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
these designs they they rely on on the
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
heating of the building to melt the snow
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the roof the roof isn't really
 
03:24:29.950 --> 03:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
structurally adequate to hold snow loads
 
03:24:32.790 --> 03:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
which is strange considering it's in
 
03:24:34.630 --> 03:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
Twin Mountain the North country north of
 
03:24:38.429 --> 03:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
the N where we get a lot more snow um
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
fuel efficiencies and stuff like that
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
are are just um not really uh
 
03:24:46.590 --> 03:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
sustainable uh as well as the age and
 
03:24:48.590 --> 03:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
everything with the roof
 
03:24:51.870 --> 03:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
um in other smaller facilities we do
 
03:24:53.910 --> 03:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
look within our operational budget with
 
03:24:56.870 --> 03:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
our own State forces to to do roof
 
03:25:00.269 --> 03:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
Replacements and stuff if if we can uh
 
03:25:02.349 --> 03:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
again this is a much larger Capital
 
03:25:04.189 --> 03:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
project due to the size of facility the
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
age of the facility the structural type
 
03:25:11.630 --> 03:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
of work that would be um required to um
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh replace this existing roof uh so this
 
03:25:20.950 --> 03:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
um and finally uh priority number four
 
03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
um which I again would utilize most of
 
03:25:30.550 --> 03:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of again that $10 million
 
03:25:33.189 --> 03:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
threshold that I had targeted would be
 
03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
for the replacement of the uh lempster
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh Patrol shed
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to sound like a
 
03:25:44.670 --> 03:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
broken record but we do have uh
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
facilities uh uh across the state
 
03:25:49.750 --> 03:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the order of 85 to 90
 
03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
Patrol sheds and uh again historically
 
03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
we've tried to Target at least one
 
03:25:59.950 --> 03:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
Patrol shed per vium to to um seek to
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
replace and and and address if uh if
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
we're able to do that then you know
 
03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
we're on a replacement cycle of of well
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
over a hundred years which is not
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
probably ideal not really um tenable but
 
03:26:17.950 --> 03:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
at least keeping up with the worst of
 
03:26:22.110 --> 03:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
the worst um last bium we did not again
 
03:26:23.870 --> 03:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
time times were tight in the budget and
 
03:26:27.189 --> 03:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
looking at things we did not um have a
 
03:26:31.189 --> 03:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh Patrol shed uh funded for some other
 
03:26:33.070 --> 03:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
life safety Investments and things that
 
03:26:35.150 --> 03:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
needed to go on to meet fire code and
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
things like that um but in this bium um
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
to keep from falling further behind in
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
our uh Building Maintenance and
 
03:26:46.229 --> 03:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
replacement cycle we'd like to talk
 
03:26:49.229 --> 03:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
Target at least this one oldest Patrol
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
shed in our inventory for replacement
 
03:26:55.229 --> 03:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
and the building replacement costs do
 
03:26:59.229 --> 03:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
continue to to increase um and this is a
 
03:27:02.189 --> 03:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
a fairly um substantial investment of
 
03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
about $3.5
 
03:27:07.950 --> 03:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
million um and along those lines the the
 
03:27:10.229 --> 03:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
next highest priority is a patrol shed
 
03:27:12.550 --> 03:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
and Pinkham Notch
 
03:27:16.389 --> 03:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
um we whether whether whether whether
 
03:27:18.590 --> 03:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
there would be funding or or not we
 
03:27:22.070 --> 03:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
would at least like to begin the
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
planning and some initial design work on
 
03:27:28.790 --> 03:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
on what a um facility for that next
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
highest priority Patrol shed would um
 
03:27:34.429 --> 03:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
would look like and what it might cost
 
03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
so um that would be the residual uh
 
03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
amount of the funding that priority
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
number five pink and Patrol facility uh
 
03:27:45.710 --> 03:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
preconstruction um for whatever would
 
03:27:48.429 --> 03:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
last with than our targeted $10 million
 
03:27:48.439 --> 03:27:49.870 align:start position:0%
last with than our targeted $10 million
uh

03:27:49.870 --> 03:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:27:51.950 --> 03:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
request and some of the pictures for
 
03:27:55.950 --> 03:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
those facilities are shown on within the
 
03:27:58.510 --> 03:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
book on page
 
03:27:58.520 --> 03:28:00.670 align:start position:0%
book on page
41

03:28:00.670 --> 03:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
41
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
um and the Pinkham shed beginning on
 
03:28:03.239 --> 03:28:05.349 align:start position:0%
um and the Pinkham shed beginning on
page

03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:28:08.429 --> 03:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
45 so it's been just about a half hour
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
that um that uh kind of concludes a very
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
high level summary of the of our budget
 
03:28:16.750 --> 03:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
request there is a lot of information
 
03:28:18.910 --> 03:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
in in the book so hopefully any your
 
03:28:21.550 --> 03:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
questions about these uh requests are
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
are answered there but I'll certainly
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
ask entertain any further questions MREs
 
03:28:28.590 --> 03:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
CL okay thank you Mr sh can you tell me
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner exactly where the patrol
 
03:28:33.030 --> 03:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
shed in lster is
 
03:28:36.750 --> 03:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
located uh I I can it's on Route 10
 
03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
Route 10 south of uh
 
03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's um yeah it's on Route 10 uh
 
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's a it's at the southerly limits of
 
03:28:49.630 --> 03:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
District Two and the Northerly you know
 
03:28:51.750 --> 03:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
just over the line from I think Marlo
 
03:28:55.950 --> 03:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
and and District uh two okay and just I
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
used to represent that
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
Community I figured it but I just want
 
03:29:01.990 --> 03:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
to be absolutely thank you commissioner
 
03:29:04.750 --> 03:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any further
 
03:29:07.309 --> 03:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
questions repres representative
 
03:29:09.750 --> 03:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
Boger thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you might
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
have answered this and I just didn't
 
03:29:17.990 --> 03:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
hear it and or didn't register on uh
 
03:29:20.349 --> 03:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
your priority number two the underground
 
03:29:24.189 --> 03:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
storage tanks uh how many tanks would
 
03:29:25.790 --> 03:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
the $2
 
03:29:25.800 --> 03:29:28.750 align:start position:0%
the $2
million

03:29:28.750 --> 03:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
replace I saw the list
 
03:29:31.680 --> 03:29:33.429 align:start position:0%
replace I saw the list
over

03:29:33.429 --> 03:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:29:37.229 --> 03:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
on of Tanks but
 
03:29:40.269 --> 03:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
my I don't want to assume if that covers
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
all of those or not and so I was just
 
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
curious um it's a a hard question to
 
03:29:49.990 --> 03:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
answer um I know when we just did a
 
03:29:52.030 --> 03:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
facility that that was just built up in
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh it was about $800,000 to do a
 
03:29:57.309 --> 03:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
full tank replacement and that was a a
 
03:30:00.030 --> 03:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
full distribution site um some of the
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
ones pictured here are are are diesel
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
only um it may not be the full tanks it
 
03:30:10.189 --> 03:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
may be the um the tank top and the um
 
03:30:14.150 --> 03:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
and the um um dispenser type of type of
 
03:30:16.590 --> 03:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
system to be Co code so would be
 
03:30:20.349 --> 03:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
substantially less um I don't know I'll
 
03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
ask um Dave do you have any better uh
 
03:30:25.630 --> 03:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
details on that or I think you it two to
 
03:30:27.950 --> 03:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
three sites two to three sites and Dave
 
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
is our assistant commissioner so Dave
 
03:30:32.189 --> 03:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
rodrigue thank you you're welcome
 
03:30:34.469 --> 03:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you I've
 
03:30:36.070 --> 03:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to look through the
 
03:30:40.269 --> 03:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
laps uh document that you and my my uh
 
03:30:42.670 --> 03:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
figures match exactly with the one
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
exception I'm not sure if you covered
 
03:30:46.510 --> 03:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
this earlier we wanted to to have an
 
03:30:49.070 --> 03:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
extension for the Carol and straford
 
03:30:52.790 --> 03:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
improvements that uh this is 2023 Roman
 
03:30:58.269 --> 03:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
15 number
 
03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
three I think that's outside no it's
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
part of
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
D that uh former chairman Campbell had
 
03:31:09.750 --> 03:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
asked had had asked about
 
03:31:12.030 --> 03:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
250,000 I I don't have the amount here
 
03:31:14.590 --> 03:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
but whatever you say it's uh it is in
 
03:31:16.830 --> 03:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
process it's 202 pulling forward but
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's encumbered so the work Isen all
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
right well we'll add an extension for it
 
03:31:23.790 --> 03:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
if that's all
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
right like to bring your attention to to
 
03:31:29.710 --> 03:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
the last two items on that list as
 
03:31:32.429 --> 03:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry I'd like to bring your
 
03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
attention to the last two items on that
 
03:31:38.790 --> 03:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
list as well um these are very old items
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
they were for the railroad acquisition
 
03:31:44.790 --> 03:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
first right of refusal and for um
 
03:31:46.510 --> 03:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
acquisition of railroad airport
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
properties and there hasn't been
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
activity in in these lines in quite a
 
03:31:53.150 --> 03:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
bit that they're like holders they
 
03:31:54.750 --> 03:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
holders those if you're referencing
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
207 so our thought with that would be to
 
03:32:06.910 --> 03:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
repurpose those funds um and use the
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
funds for our priorities to uh
 
03:32:18.389 --> 03:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps Mr chairman we could ask them
 
03:32:22.950 --> 03:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
for a document that we could consider at
 
03:32:27.510 --> 03:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
the work session yes uh okay um we're
 
03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
going to meet next Tuesday if we could
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
have some sort of documentation for our
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
first work session we're going to start
 
03:32:36.790 --> 03:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
going through the add-ons and deletions
 
03:32:40.550 --> 03:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
and we need some some more exact figures
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
and we're just going to roll it over
 
03:32:46.189 --> 03:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
okay okay any anything else
 
03:32:48.870 --> 03:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh that's all I have
 
03:32:49.950 --> 03:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:32:52.830 --> 03:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
agency representative
 
03:32:55.150 --> 03:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:32:57.309 --> 03:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions uh duve tailing
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
off of Representative boger's question
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
regarding the underground storage tanks
 
03:33:05.790 --> 03:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
has there been any conversation about
 
03:33:08.429 --> 03:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
filling those tanks up with cement or
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
with sand and finding a new location for
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the specific um finding someplace on
 
03:33:17.670 --> 03:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
the on the property where the new tanks
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
installed I guess I'm not I I I don't
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
quite understand you're looking to
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
replace those those gas tanks correct
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
sure yes so instead of removing them out
 
03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the ground was a conversation had
 
03:33:33.070 --> 03:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
either filling them up with sand or
 
03:33:36.510 --> 03:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
cement and sealing them and shutting it
 
03:33:39.150 --> 03:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
off so that another suitable location
 
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
could be picked for your free gas tank
 
03:33:44.349 --> 03:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
as part of the design work when we do a
 
03:33:46.870 --> 03:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
new a new fuel site uh we do look on
 
03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
site for the most
 
03:33:51.269 --> 03:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
advantageous uh way of doing it we have
 
03:33:54.429 --> 03:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
and and other recent projects um
 
03:33:56.910 --> 03:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
Consolidated locations within within a
 
03:33:58.910 --> 03:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
region or between two or three Patrol
 
03:34:02.670 --> 03:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
sheds um on the site specific uh we
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just um unless it made the most
 
03:34:08.670 --> 03:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
sense we wouldn't just uh replace it
 
03:34:10.189 --> 03:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
right right in kind there we would look
 
03:34:12.910 --> 03:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
to do it in the most advantageous place
 
03:34:15.790 --> 03:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
um and as far as just uh filling with
 
03:34:19.830 --> 03:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
sand or or concrete um I'm I'm not sure
 
03:34:23.030 --> 03:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
if the um if the current reg if the
 
03:34:25.710 --> 03:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
regulations would would allow for that I
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
do believe there is some uh remediation
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
when when uh underground fuel tanks are
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
removed to to ensure that they are um
 
03:34:36.670 --> 03:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
done and there's no leakage and stuff
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
like that but uh we would look to do it
 
03:34:38.880 --> 03:34:40.469 align:start position:0%
like that but uh we would look to do it
as

03:34:40.469 --> 03:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:34:44.110 --> 03:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
as in the most economic means possible
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative jurus thank you Mr
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
chairman commissioner in the replacement
 
03:34:55.830 --> 03:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the the garages or uh or roofs have
 
03:34:58.269 --> 03:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
you considered photovoltaics on those
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
roofs considered what photovoltaics on
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
those phot take solar on those roofs to
 
03:35:06.750 --> 03:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
net meter yes we have okay we we did a
 
03:35:10.990 --> 03:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh a patrol shed uh Rehabilitation
 
03:35:13.150 --> 03:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
right in right in Manchester off
 
03:35:16.110 --> 03:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
101 uh and as part of and as part of
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
that um I think we added one one Bay and
 
03:35:23.150 --> 03:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
had had renovated the the patrol shed
 
03:35:24.750 --> 03:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
and as part of that there were solar
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
panels added to the roof um to help um
 
03:35:30.309 --> 03:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
mitigate the energy costs thank you
 
03:35:30.319 --> 03:35:31.670 align:start position:0%
mitigate the energy costs thank you
you're

03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:35:34.189 --> 03:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you seeing no further
 
03:35:37.030 --> 03:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sorry representative
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
Edgar I just thank you has a final
 
03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I was just
 
03:35:44.189 --> 03:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
waiting to see if somebody's going to
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
ask a question I was going to ask
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
um could uh I appreciate you helping me
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
with the answers to this I'm looking at
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
the summary you gave us on the guess
 
03:35:57.510 --> 03:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
guess it's page one or it's on uh minus
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
one you have um the different the state
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
match for the FAA projects and you got a
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
A Transit match um they total up to you
 
03:36:10.990 --> 03:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
know 7 million something now is it true
 
03:36:14.590 --> 03:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
that by your documentation here that we
 
03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
would uh forfeit sense like
 
03:36:20.229 --> 03:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
$70,000 7 $70 million of of stuff that
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to match are we going to
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
able to do anything at the airports or
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
am I reading this wrong no you're
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
reading it right that that is that is
 
03:36:30.269 --> 03:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
part of the ask here that it does uh put
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
those federal funds in Jeopardy if there
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
not a viable way of of meeting the match
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
requirements so we letting whether 60
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
years $70 million worth of of projects
 
03:36:45.910 --> 03:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
we could have got done uh that the feds
 
03:36:47.910 --> 03:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
would have paid for by by not matching
 
03:36:50.510 --> 03:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
it yes I just wanted to to highlight
 
03:36:50.520 --> 03:36:52.269 align:start position:0%
it yes I just wanted to to highlight
that

03:36:52.269 --> 03:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:57.150 --> 03:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
um I have follow thank you Mr
 
03:37:01.150 --> 03:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
chair uh on the the highway fund items
 
03:37:04.269 --> 03:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
most of them are not being requested are
 
03:37:06.269 --> 03:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
you right now it looks like you're only
 
03:37:10.269 --> 03:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
requesting the uh the top one uh salt
 
03:37:13.870 --> 03:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
shacks and stuff are you the top one was
 
03:37:15.670 --> 03:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
funded in the governor's budget so so
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
the Statewide uh salt and sand sheds was
 
03:37:21.070 --> 03:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
funded in the governor's budget it was
 
03:37:22.830 --> 03:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
funded for a little bit more than than
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
what we had here it's funded at $ 4.65
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
million we're we're we're suggesting
 
03:37:30.469 --> 03:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
we're recommending we're requesting uh
 
03:37:34.349 --> 03:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
$3 million and we would work within it
 
03:37:37.870 --> 03:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
um where we drew a Gray Line there below
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh priority number five um I I I had
 
03:37:44.150 --> 03:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
pointed out at the beginning in our
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
operations budget we we have uh The Debt
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
Service uh budgeted over the next bium
 
03:37:53.670 --> 03:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
that would support um you know a$ 10
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
million capital investment here so I I
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
targeted uh a $10 million capital budget
 
03:38:05.950 --> 03:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
ask for the highway fund um portion of
 
03:38:08.429 --> 03:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
this but there are certainly more needs
 
03:38:10.469 --> 03:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
than than that I I
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
I but I'm trying to be realistic in what
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
I know our budget will support as well
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we got all this so shows quite a
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
bit but the uh so you you feel um
 
03:38:23.870 --> 03:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with uh with the Department
 
03:38:26.189 --> 03:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
of Transportation taking on as much as
 
03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
10 million uh spending that much out of
 
03:38:31.189 --> 03:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
the trust fund excuse me out of the
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
highway fund the needs are really there
 
03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
and you would prefer that yes yes in the
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
priority shown yes okay thank you very
 
03:38:42.510 --> 03:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:46.040 align:start position:0%

quickly very quickly please um so the
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
contract that was signed for the last
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
capital budget $250,000 of State funds
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
matching 250,000 of of nhn funds that
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
contract was signed August until August
 
03:39:37.990 --> 03:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
30th by the governor and Council they
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
put in that agreement that it would be
 
03:39:43.590 --> 03:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
um that's that the period to perform is
 
03:39:45.870 --> 03:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
through December 31st of 201
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
2 it's not consistent with legislation
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
LBA recommended that it be extended to
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
2025 to line up with the agreement and I
 
03:39:58.110 --> 03:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
think that's what the commissioner and
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
um representative Jack were just talking
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
about how out on that representative
 
03:40:05.630 --> 03:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
Jack okay yeah that's that's the item
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
that I spoke about
 
03:40:11.630 --> 03:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
earlier uh so you know this committee
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
and both representative Democratic uh
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
Led Led legislatur have included
 
03:40:18.269 --> 03:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
matching funds for New Hampshire's
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
Freight railroads in the last F Five
 
03:40:24.349 --> 03:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
Capital budgets 2017 on and for that the
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire North Coast is very
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
thankful um the upkeep of railroad
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and the challenges facing
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
all Shortline railroads including the
 
03:40:39.950 --> 03:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
state just heard um is is daunting and
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
and it faces not only us but uh all
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
shortland railroads and and and 40% of
 
03:40:47.469 --> 03:40:47.479 align:start position:0%
all Freight in America all rail Freight
 
03:40:49.630 --> 03:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
I should say is is hollowed by Shortline
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
railroads not just the main lines these
 
03:40:53.189 --> 03:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
are the these are the veins that go off
 
03:40:54.630 --> 03:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
the arteries and that's where the that's
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
where the businesses are um I sent a
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
link last week for an historical
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
documentary that we prepared it's part
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
of a a Federal grant it's 40 minutes
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
long but it goes fast believe it or not
 
03:41:07.229 --> 03:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
and uh it does
 
03:41:10.429 --> 03:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
show interestingly through over 150
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
years before the Civil War through the
 
03:41:13.990 --> 03:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
Civil War through World War I the
 
03:41:16.750 --> 03:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
depression the of the automobile World
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
War II it does it does show that the one
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
thing that drives railroads drives this
 
03:41:25.429 --> 03:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
thing is you have to have a
 
03:41:29.110 --> 03:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
commodity that makes the railroad work
 
03:41:30.790 --> 03:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
you got to have something whether it's
 
03:41:35.429 --> 03:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
ice or uh or passengers or you know ski
 
03:41:35.439 --> 03:41:36.229 align:start position:0%
ice or uh or passengers or you know ski
ski

03:41:36.229 --> 03:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
ski
 
03:41:39.269 --> 03:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
trains uh or Timber it has to be
 
03:41:41.710 --> 03:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
something that drives it for the last uh
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
50 years it's been it's been sand and
 
03:41:45.870 --> 03:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
gravel and Propane
 
03:41:49.630 --> 03:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
um and that's because the cost of
 
03:41:51.790 --> 03:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
maintaining tracks has always been will
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
always be expensive probably
 
03:41:57.070 --> 03:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
disproportionately so now um so I just
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that before I get into
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to go through this
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
whole thing because it's Alli there for
 
03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
you but I just want to tell you the
 
03:42:05.429 --> 03:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
first slide tells what we are for those
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
that aren't familiar with us we're a 42
 
03:42:09.550 --> 03:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
mile Short Line railroad we run from
 
03:42:13.630 --> 03:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford up to oopy um strictly
 
03:42:17.110 --> 03:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
strictly uh um Freight the second slide
 
03:42:19.309 --> 03:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
talks about the largest commodity is
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
concrete sand second is propane propane
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
comes in to the facility in Rochester
 
03:42:26.670 --> 03:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
where it's distributed goes into the
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
storage facility and it's distributed by
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
trucks all over the region Eastern
 
03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
Propane sec I think the second largest
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh propane company in New Hampshire um
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
they're very supportive uh their vice
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
president sent a letter of support and
 
03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
and gives his reasonings why and let you
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
read that for yourself of the concrete
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
say about approximately 38 40% of it
 
03:42:48.429 --> 03:42:48.439 align:start position:0%
goes to Rochester not all the way to
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
Boston just to Rochester for the for the
 
03:42:52.229 --> 03:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
concrete plants in that region and the
 
03:42:53.790 --> 03:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
other and the rest goes to Boston the
 
03:42:55.870 --> 03:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
propane comes in this year because of
 
03:42:57.670 --> 03:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
the cold I think they're going to do
 
03:43:01.070 --> 03:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
over well over 800 cars um it's so
 
03:43:04.110 --> 03:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
important because by save by saving
 
03:43:08.590 --> 03:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
money uh for for the import of propane
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's pass the LA to Consumers the
 
03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
cost goes up if they do it by truck not
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
only is it is it cost less cost
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
effective and not efficient
 
03:43:19.229 --> 03:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
environmentally in every other way um it
 
03:43:22.030 --> 03:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
would drive the price of of of fuel of
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
propane up um the transloading facility
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
is is pictured on page
 
03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:30.269 align:start position:0%
is is pictured on page
four

03:43:30.269 --> 03:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
um the freight railroad takes a lot of
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
truck traffic off the road uh 40,000
 
03:43:40.269 --> 03:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
roundt trips of heavy trailer or tanker
 
03:43:41.870 --> 03:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
trucks come off the road every year
 
03:43:43.950 --> 03:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
because of of the freight that's hauled
 
03:43:46.070 --> 03:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire North Coast
 
03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh taking 1.7 million heavy truck trips
 
03:43:53.469 --> 03:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
off highways over the last 37 years is
 
03:43:55.630 --> 03:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
pretty incredible that has dramatically
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
increased fuel efficiency discre discre
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
decreases carbon emissions greatly
 
03:44:03.710 --> 03:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
improves highway safety which from your
 
03:44:05.469 --> 03:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
Vantage Point significantly reduces wear
 
03:44:08.189 --> 03:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
and tear on highways Municipal roads and
 
03:44:10.750 --> 03:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
it saves on maintenance
 
03:44:14.590 --> 03:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
costs so uh slide six just kind of goes
 
03:44:17.309 --> 03:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
over the scope of of the maintenance and
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
repairs the numbers are there 247,000
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
ties uh and it shows the cost and the
 
03:44:27.630 --> 03:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
next slide too addresses you know what's
 
03:44:31.510 --> 03:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
going on as far as the um amount of
 
03:44:33.790 --> 03:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs to be addressed and
 
03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
we've been fortunate to
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
have the state of New Hampshire be
 
03:44:40.630 --> 03:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
supportive of great railroad throughout
 
03:44:42.429 --> 03:44:42.439 align:start position:0%
the years New Hampshire and North Coast
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't exist wasn't for the funding uh
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
contributions that's made Through The
 
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
Years by the state and the federal
 
03:44:50.790 --> 03:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
government private businesses have given
 
03:44:52.670 --> 03:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
money including the Eastern Propane and
 
03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
the municipalities they they they
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
participated um a lot in the various
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
years so uh slide eight is just the
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
history of the state of state grants um
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
going back to
 
03:45:09.790 --> 03:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
2017 the probably the 10 years prior to
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
that 12 years prior prior to that the
 
03:45:14.349 --> 03:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
only state funds other than State
 
03:45:16.750 --> 03:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
administered Crossing grants it's a
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
federal program it was probably $150,000
 
03:45:22.389 --> 03:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
for the state put into a multi-million
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
dollar tiger
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
Grant the ninth slide ninth slide talks
 
03:45:30.269 --> 03:45:30.279 align:start position:0%
about um current Chrissy Grant we have
 
03:45:33.070 --> 03:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
which is dressing rails ties Ballance
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
replacement a Crossing upgrade but more
 
03:45:37.590 --> 03:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
importantly in Rochester there's the
 
03:45:39.189 --> 03:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
Haven Hill Bridge which has been struck
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
so many times and there's pictures of it
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
in some of the documents it just keeps
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
getting hit by by trucks it comes in
 
03:45:46.429 --> 03:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
groups and then it doesn't happen for
 
03:45:50.590 --> 03:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
for years and it does um it is a it is a
 
03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
real problem it was built in the 1800s
 
03:45:54.189 --> 03:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
and it's not high enough we're going to
 
03:45:55.590 --> 03:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
raise that this year as part of that
 
03:45:57.830 --> 03:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
Grant but there's 32 other Bridges and
 
03:46:00.510 --> 03:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
scores of stone and granite culverts uh
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
in fact what we're asking for this year
 
03:46:04.750 --> 03:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
is is is one of the really amazing
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
architectural features historical
 
03:46:08.110 --> 03:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
features on the rail it's this Arch
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
Bridge and you can see pictures of it in
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
the upcoming slides that Arch Bridge was
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
replaced a 200 foot long uh Timber span
 
03:46:18.189 --> 03:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
back in the 1800s and they built this
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
thing it's basically a Roman Roman Arch
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
and it uh it's held up very well but
 
03:46:26.429 --> 03:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
it's it needs to be repointed the
 
03:46:28.110 --> 03:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
problem is because it is in this
 
03:46:33.429 --> 03:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
precarious Place o over 200 feet stretch
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
um Great Brook is called the Milton
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
Milton and because of that uh it has to
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
go down steep slopes and it's very
 
03:46:42.910 --> 03:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
expensive to get to it immobilize so
 
03:46:44.550 --> 03:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
that is part of this year's tiger Grant
 
03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:45.590 align:start position:0%
that is part of this year's tiger Grant
request

03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:46:48.389 --> 03:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
which I show you how and our request
 
03:46:51.630 --> 03:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
today is for respectfully asked for
 
03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
$450,000 in state funds to match
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
$450,000 in in match money to address
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
these four items ver is that Stone Arch
 
03:47:03.309 --> 03:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
Bridge which a total estimat about
 
03:47:03.319 --> 03:47:05.630 align:start position:0%
Bridge which a total estimat about
438,000

03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
438,000
 
03:47:08.309 --> 03:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
then there's a covert replacement which
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
you can see the picture of which is
 
03:47:10.439 --> 03:47:11.309 align:start position:0%
you can see the picture of which is
pretty

03:47:11.309 --> 03:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
much which is pretty much collapsed
 
03:47:16.910 --> 03:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
Mainline switch there's a diagram of how
 
03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
complicated that is and how big that is
 
03:47:21.550 --> 03:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a Crossing placement
 
03:47:23.429 --> 03:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
in Wakefield it's one of the longest
 
03:47:26.189 --> 03:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
Crossings and it's because it I'm sorry
 
03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's Wayfield Street in Rochester it's
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
one of the longest Crossings and it
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
diagonally crosses uh Wakefield Street
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
and it's you can't see it on top but the
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
whole subsurface all the old ties are
 
03:47:37.790 --> 03:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
rotting out underneath it that's not
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
only just a that's that could shut down
 
03:47:43.229 --> 03:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
the rail line but it could also um cause
 
03:47:45.710 --> 03:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
problems with the motoring power public
 
03:47:47.309 --> 03:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
and I think as
 
03:47:49.830 --> 03:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
um Bob LEF says in his letter of
 
03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
endorsement for us today which we
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate he says that and he
 
03:47:55.630 --> 03:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
rightfully so he says a railroad is like
 
03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
a a a chain it's only as strong as its
 
03:48:00.510 --> 03:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
weakest link if a bridge goes out
 
03:48:03.149 --> 03:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
Crossing goes out there's no railroad
 
03:48:06.030 --> 03:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
nothing can go back and forth so there's
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
some pictures to show it what we are
 
03:48:10.950 --> 03:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
asking for and with that I would uh sum
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
up and uh and finish and answer any
 
03:48:15.710 --> 03:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
03:48:22.750 --> 03:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.790 --> 03:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
kazinski yeah your mic's
 
03:48:25.800 --> 03:48:27.469 align:start position:0%
kazinski yeah your mic's
off

03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
so at lunch I was just looking at a
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
couple of figures and I see that Freight
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
rail is actually the most profitable
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
business in the United States
 
03:48:42.510 --> 03:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 50% profit so the owner of
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
this track this private rail is Boston
 
03:48:47.950 --> 03:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
sand and gravel
 
03:48:50.469 --> 03:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
right correct they own they own New
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire North Coast railroad right
 
03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
so what's their revenue for a year
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
anyway I I can't tell you that but I can
 
03:49:00.750 --> 03:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
tell you unequivocally that they don't
 
03:49:02.830 --> 03:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
make 50% profit that they barely make
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
profit if they make profit on that
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
railroad every year that I can that I
 
03:49:10.750 --> 03:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
know and and that's because of the
 
03:49:14.590 --> 03:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
extreme cost of of the infrastructure uh
 
03:49:17.349 --> 03:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
it I mean we could always do more but we
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
don't we do as much as we can do to keep
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
the railroad operating uh they are they
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
also own usby agregates which is their
 
03:49:26.950 --> 03:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
big biggest customer so as a result you
 
03:49:29.550 --> 03:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
know asby agregates gets to make some
 
03:49:32.030 --> 03:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
money businesses have to make money no
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
business in America continues to operate
 
03:49:35.710 --> 03:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
unless it makes some kind of money or at
 
03:49:38.590 --> 03:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
least breaks even enough to to to cause
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
another company to make money uh I'm not
 
03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
privy or not able to give you exact
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
figures but
 
03:49:48.429 --> 03:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
I I I would dispute strongly that all
 
03:49:50.149 --> 03:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
railroads make 50 great railroads make
 
03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
50% they all struggle to make profits
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
and I I can say without a doubt that New
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:04.349 --> 03:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
profit I guess well I don't want to get
 
03:50:06.830 --> 03:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
into the debate here but yeah we're not
 
03:50:08.429 --> 03:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have a debate on this
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
but so thank you questions will be
 
03:50:12.910 --> 03:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
answered asked and answered no
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
debate representative
 
03:50:17.469 --> 03:50:17.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a quick question
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out the
 
03:50:21.269 --> 03:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
propane where does so the you move the
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
propane from where to where and where
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
where does that propane come from is it
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
coming down from
 
03:50:28.429 --> 03:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
Maine lot of comes from selker New York
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
there's a big there's a big natural gas
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
head there or a propane head there that
 
03:50:36.269 --> 03:50:36.279 align:start position:0%
they they bring it in um and then it's
 
03:50:38.830 --> 03:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
redistributed throughout the Northeast
 
03:50:40.710 --> 03:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
from cerk a lot of it comes from cerk I
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
know that because I see the slips so it
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
comes on the main line CSX hauls it to
 
03:50:48.030 --> 03:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford where it's switched on to
 
03:50:51.149 --> 03:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
the to our line and we bring it up
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
actually it's a little more comp it
 
03:50:54.349 --> 03:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
actually goes all the way to Portland
 
03:50:56.149 --> 03:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah because of down Easter and the and
 
03:50:58.870 --> 03:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
the uh conflict of schedules it goes all
 
03:51:00.670 --> 03:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
the way to Portland to their yard and
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
then when they have a chance they run
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
special trains down to Rollinsford to
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
switch to North Coast North Coast
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
accommodates them immediately and brings
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.630 --> 03:51:15.640 align:start position:0%

much progress tackling deferred

maintenance but we still have more to do
 
03:54:39.790 --> 03:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
we must also acknowledge the millions of

to upgrade our extensive infrastructure

at an 11% cut of our general fund

03:56:56.750 --> 03:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
to be fully transparent with you about
 
03:56:58.630 --> 03:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
where we believe the state's Investments
 
03:57:01.309 --> 03:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
are most urgent we are seeking to
 
03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
address fundamental needs to establish
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
and maintain our facilities up to a
 
03:57:07.750 --> 03:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
standard worthy of our visitors with the
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
hope of maximizing Revenue opportunities
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
throughout our great state safety and
 
03:57:14.590 --> 03:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
quality of experience requires proper
 
03:57:16.950 --> 03:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
care and upkeep and we appreciate your
 
03:57:19.950 --> 03:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful consideration of our
 
03:57:22.349 --> 03:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
priorities I know you have a lot to go
 
03:57:24.510 --> 03:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
through today so I thought we would
 
03:57:26.830 --> 03:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
start with what we feel are our most
 
03:57:29.710 --> 03:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
critical needs um and I invited our
 
03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
director of state parks to address the
 
03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
aerial Tramway at
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
Canon I think we should start with the
 
03:57:38.070 --> 03:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
aerial Trailway at Canon that would be
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
great that would be great so I'm going
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
to ask um Brian Wilson to walk you
 
03:57:45.510 --> 03:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
through how we got to where we are today
 
03:57:47.790 --> 03:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
with the Tramway situation and where we
 
03:57:49.149 --> 03:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
think we need to
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
go thank you commissioner again my name
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
is Brian Wilson I'm the director of the
 
03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
division of Parks and Recreation oversee
 
03:57:57.070 --> 03:57:57.080 align:start position:0%

sites uh the Canon Mountain Tramway uh
 
03:58:09.030 --> 03:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
2.0 is the current Tramway that we have
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
in place which has been operating for 46
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
years now about six years ago uh we were
 
03:58:19.229 --> 03:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh put on notice from the uh uh
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that uh it was approaching
 
03:58:24.030 --> 03:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
its end of life and certain components
 
03:58:26.269 --> 03:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
of uh the tram system were not going to
 
03:58:28.469 --> 03:58:28.479 align:start position:0%
be able to be remade should they uh have
 
03:58:31.030 --> 03:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
a failure at some point in time at that
 
03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
time the department um started putting
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
into their capital budget requests uh
 
03:58:37.990 --> 03:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
funding uh based on estimates provided
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
at that time now that's over six years
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
ago and clearly the uh cost estimates um
 
03:58:45.630 --> 03:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
have uh ES ated over that time for all
 
03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
the factors that everything that you
 
03:58:49.149 --> 03:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
guys are uh taking before you through
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%

03:58:52.030 --> 03:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
03:58:55.950 --> 03:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
um it in uh in the last BM Governor
 
03:58:59.670 --> 03:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
sonunu had uh put in $18 million uh for
 
03:59:03.309 --> 03:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
the aerial Tramway um after there was a
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
request for 25 million from the agency
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh at that time uh the $25 million
 
03:59:11.670 --> 03:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
request at the time was uh based off of
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
the best estimates that we had at the
 
03:59:16.910 --> 03:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
time and knowing that we had some but
 
03:59:19.229 --> 03:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
not a lot of available resources within
 
03:59:21.550 --> 03:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
the division of parks through some uh
 
03:59:23.790 --> 03:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
Grand oportunities as well as excess
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
operating Revenue that we were uh
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
willing to put towards uh the project to
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
see it through we went through a very
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
complex and um lengthy bidding process
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
for the aerial Tramway um and we
 
03:59:42.510 --> 03:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
received one bid result um that was $33
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
million um at that that time we were
 
03:59:46.990 --> 03:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
essentially forced to reject the bid um
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
with18 million in hand uh and the cost
 
03:59:52.510 --> 03:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
of the project for 33 million it's
 
03:59:54.189 --> 03:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
important to note that within that bid
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
there was other work that was uh uh part
 
03:59:59.229 --> 03:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
of the specifications which was uh
 
04:00:01.750 --> 04:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
restoration and a uh painting
 
04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
application to the steel infrastructure
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
at the uh base and Summit lodges as well
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
as the three towers that are between the
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
base and the summit that support the
 
04:00:14.670 --> 04:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
Tramway system um what we also found
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
through this bidding process was the uh
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
one of the two uh prospective biders
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
opted to not bid on the project uh but
 
04:00:25.469 --> 04:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
instead provided us a in-depth memo um
 
04:00:27.870 --> 04:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
pointing out areas that they thought
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
that our bid specific bid specifications
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
fell short um of describing current
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
conditions for them to be able to make
 
04:00:40.229 --> 04:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh Structural Engineering decisions um
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with the division
 
04:00:43.429 --> 04:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
of Public Works on this project they
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
administr it and so from that point we
 
04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
have been sharpening our pencils and
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
moving towards a structural engineering
 
04:00:53.710 --> 04:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
assessment uh which is going to be going
 
04:00:55.710 --> 04:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
out to bid uh within the next couple of
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
weeks Public Works and uh Parks have
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
been working on that for almost a year
 
04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
to try to win down to really uh get down
 
04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
to the information that we thought was
 
04:01:07.469 --> 04:01:07.479 align:start position:0%
uh critical to getting uh more more bids
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
but hopefully more thorough bids and and
 
04:01:13.229 --> 04:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
potentially uh has the opportunity of um
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
a cleaner bid to come in at at a at a
 
04:01:15.720 --> 04:01:16.830 align:start position:0%
a cleaner bid to come in at at a at a
reduced

04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
04:01:21.110 --> 04:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
cost um within uh Governor aot's budget
 
04:01:22.750 --> 04:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
um within the capital budget she has
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
appropriated $20 million for this
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
project also within the general fund
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
operating budget for the state um she
 
04:01:34.990 --> 04:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
has proposed um re uh having the $18
 
04:01:36.269 --> 04:01:36.279 align:start position:0%
million that have already been
 
04:01:38.149 --> 04:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated by Governor sonunu laps
 
04:01:42.469 --> 04:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
back so that means um we are $2 million
 
04:01:44.229 --> 04:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
closer to seeing this Pro project
 
04:01:47.149 --> 04:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
completed uh than we were two years ago
 
04:01:49.469 --> 04:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
um but we also know that it it is likely
 
04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
to be a $30 million project no matter
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
what so we're we're at a juncture here
 
04:01:59.149 --> 04:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh at at this stage um short of further
 
04:01:59.159 --> 04:02:00.309 align:start position:0%
uh at at this stage um short of further
structural

04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
structural
 
04:02:03.790 --> 04:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
assessment um with um a considerable Gap
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
in in in the funding to get us all the
 
04:02:08.110 --> 04:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
way enough for Public Works to be able
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
to go bid this project again uh they
 
04:02:12.189 --> 04:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
need to be we need to be able to show
 
04:02:14.229 --> 04:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
them that the funding is available based
 
04:02:17.309 --> 04:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
on the last best estimate um so we're
 
04:02:20.469 --> 04:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
we're short of that so um even with the
 
04:02:22.269 --> 04:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
20 million that's in the capital budget
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
we're there's not very much that we're
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do with that we
 
04:02:27.910 --> 04:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
can't build a half of a aerial Tramway
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh so we're trying to Value engineer
 
04:02:31.030 --> 04:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
this project to the best extent that we
 
04:02:34.110 --> 04:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
can um but it it it is really uh kind of
 
04:02:35.710 --> 04:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
an All or Nothing
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
project um why we're at a critical point
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
here in this vium and the decisions that
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
this committee and the legislature needs
 
04:02:47.309 --> 04:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
to to make uh at this time is six years
 
04:02:49.229 --> 04:02:49.239 align:start position:0%
ago we were put on notice from the
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer um we are rapidly losing
 
04:02:55.229 --> 04:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
ground relative to our our time to be
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
able to operate the existing Tramway um
 
04:03:00.309 --> 04:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
this will be the first time in the
 
04:03:03.389 --> 04:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
history of Canon Mountain that we would
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
be looking at the potential of
 
04:03:08.110 --> 04:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
decommissioning ayt um especially of the
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
size and scale as the aerial Tramway and
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
what it brings into Franconia Notch and
 
04:03:15.950 --> 04:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps you know just as importantly
 
04:03:18.269 --> 04:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
as our op operating Revenue that is
 
04:03:20.670 --> 04:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
derived from the operation of the tram
 
04:03:22.149 --> 04:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
particularly in the summer and fall
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
Seasons generates over a million dollars
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
annually that help support the ski
 
04:03:29.950 --> 04:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
area's operation so what will happen
 
04:03:32.349 --> 04:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
when the tram goes offline if we get to
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
a point where it goes offline is we will
 
04:03:37.750 --> 04:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
see immediate impacts to uh the way that
 
04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain uh operating budget is
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
structured um when we will not be able
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
to offer the same types of services uh
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we offer now um we had hoped that
 
04:03:52.149 --> 04:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't get to a point where we were
 
04:03:53.469 --> 04:03:53.479 align:start position:0%
um going
 
04:03:56.670 --> 04:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
offline um but that we would be under a
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
the planning and construction phase to
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
help coincide with that um so with each
 
04:04:06.510 --> 04:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
passing opportunity to fund this project
 
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
um our our window of opportunity gets a
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
little bit shorter on that not to say
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
that a tra could have be done at some
 
04:04:14.030 --> 04:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
point well into the future as well to
 
04:04:16.149 --> 04:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
but what will certainly happen is when
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
it does go offline we will start to see
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
immediate impacts both within the park
 
04:04:23.469 --> 04:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of operating and visitation uh
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
and again as the commissioner said
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
earlier as the state park system is
 
04:04:30.309 --> 04:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
entirely self-funded we are very ring on
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure that we have in the
 
04:04:34.269 --> 04:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
Parks uh to be able to uh receive the
 
04:04:36.750 --> 04:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
visitors the visitors that we get um
 
04:04:39.990 --> 04:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
Canon mountain is a Statewide attraction
 
04:04:42.269 --> 04:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
it is it is known you know for
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
Generations now uh there are people from
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
all over the world that are coming to
 
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
visit um our our White Mountains and
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're often going to try to
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
get to the top of Mount Washington or to
 
04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
get to the top of another over 4,000
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
footer which is Canon Mountain so this
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
is a very big uh project for us um and
 
04:05:02.950 --> 04:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
specific to that but I just wanted to
 
04:05:05.469 --> 04:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
kind of lay out a little the background
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
of where we are
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
today I'm sure we're going to have
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
questions I'm going to ask the first one
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
out of the 20 out of the 20 million
 
04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
which you admit is is not going to fund
 
04:05:14.640 --> 04:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
which you admit is is not going to fund
this

04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
completely and I'm I'm hoping I already
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this have you looked
 
04:05:23.550 --> 04:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
into into breaking it down to where the
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know we do a lot of projects that
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
are going to take five six seven years
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
have have you looked into breaking it
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
down into any smaller chunks in other
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
words could we get you five million that
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
would would get a design would get a a a
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
full operational dollar cost that that
 
04:05:44.910 --> 04:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
we could count on
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so um I think the my answer would be
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is All or
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
Nothing All or Nothing project but I
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
think that there there are some
 
04:05:56.910 --> 04:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
strategic ways that it could either be
 
04:06:01.149 --> 04:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
um carried over uh to bium for instance
 
04:06:03.790 --> 04:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
um that that that's a possibility there
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
um there is also some um I I I remain
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
confident that there are some other
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
creative ways that we can close the gap
 
04:06:16.110 --> 04:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
on that for instance um we have the um
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
what we utilize very heavily uh to
 
04:06:21.149 --> 04:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
upkeep the infrastructure Canon mountain
 
04:06:23.229 --> 04:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
is a Canon Mountain Capital Improvement
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
fund which is the proceeds that we get
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
from the the the lease at sunap Mountain
 
04:06:30.429 --> 04:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
on average that's going to be around
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
$700,000 a year that we getting that is
 
04:06:34.269 --> 04:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
immediately going right back into
 
04:06:36.149 --> 04:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements but the idea
 
04:06:39.229 --> 04:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
is that we have a bonding um line of
 
04:06:42.910 --> 04:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
credit up to $6 million uh to be able to
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
access and itiz for ongoing Capital
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
Improvements within the park a model
 
04:06:51.630 --> 04:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
like that where uh even a portion of
 
04:06:53.710 --> 04:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
revenue generated from the operation of
 
04:06:55.870 --> 04:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
the tram or from the park is going to
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
help pay down that debt service is an
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
option I think um we are using a similar
 
04:07:03.429 --> 04:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
model at the Sea Coast for the U seaw
 
04:07:06.149 --> 04:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
wall on Ocean Boulevard that is State
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
Park infrastructure that was millions of
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
dollars to build a seaw wall our parking
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
revenue is supporting the the the pay
 
04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
pay of those Bond payments what needs to
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
happen is a conversation of collective
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
Minds that want to see this project get
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
done um I I think that there's some
 
04:07:25.630 --> 04:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
other measures through federal grants
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
that we have opportunities to apply to
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
um leveraging resources within the park
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
fund and and perhaps offsetting uh from
 
04:07:35.510 --> 04:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
some of the revenue generation at the
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
park I think can close the gap so I
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
think there's a there's there's a little
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
bit of a platter of options um there
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
just needs to be a real concerted to
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
work towards what is the right path
 
04:07:47.469 --> 04:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
forward thank you very much for that
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
answer representative
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just want to
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear on this I've heard a
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
number of numbers over the last couple
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
weeks on what the what has been funded
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
for this project on your page two on
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements it it indicates a
 
04:08:08.429 --> 04:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
line end with $15 million I'm correct
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
right and then we were told that the
 
04:08:13.469 --> 04:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
prior appropriation was for $18 million
 
04:08:16.269 --> 04:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
and you're a now asking for 20 million
 
04:08:18.429 --> 04:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
and before I forget I think we had also
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
spoken in one of the previous meetings
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
about reuse to repair of the existing
 
04:08:26.790 --> 04:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
Towers to make sure that we could um
 
04:08:28.710 --> 04:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
complete this project so like to make
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
sure that we're we're doing that but I'm
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
also trying to figure out what number
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're actually working with what number
 
04:08:36.670 --> 04:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
the governor has said and what number
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
you guys are using right now because I
 
04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
got three numbers in my head yep great
 
04:08:43.790 --> 04:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
question so um the the $1 15 million
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
that you see in our request was to be in
 
04:08:48.910 --> 04:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
addition to the $18 million that a year
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
ago when we made this request we had in
 
04:08:53.229 --> 04:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
hand so that combined was going to bring
 
04:08:55.550 --> 04:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
us to the $33 million which was the cost
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
of the one bid that we got so that is
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
the 15 is a little less than half of
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
what we had um already available to us
 
04:09:06.389 --> 04:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
to get to the full project completion
 
04:09:11.550 --> 04:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
the um the 20 number is um I I I don't
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
know what um if that's arbitrary or
 
04:09:16.750 --> 04:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
where that came from uh within the
 
04:09:20.469 --> 04:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
governor's budget um but that is what
 
04:09:23.550 --> 04:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
she she put in as a placeholder uh to to
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know start get us most of
 
04:09:28.030 --> 04:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
the way there um but I I'll use the word
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
arbitrary in a sense because that's not
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
tied to any specific thing that we asked
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
for um and um sorry there was one other
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
missing number there the the so the
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
assurances that the concrete is viable
 
04:09:44.830 --> 04:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
in the future should help reduce the
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
cost right but we can't prove that until
 
04:09:49.229 --> 04:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
we go through this assessment that we're
 
04:09:52.269 --> 04:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
working with DPW currently so there's a
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a time frame overlap
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
with the 18 million that was allocated
 
04:10:01.229 --> 04:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
to us it's being taken away from us but
 
04:10:03.630 --> 04:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
before June we've already been working
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
on this bid to assure to get an
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
engineers's assessment and assurance
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
that the concrete towers are sturdy
 
04:10:12.750 --> 04:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
enough for the future so we'd like to
 
04:10:15.070 --> 04:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
proceed with that we're working with DPW
 
04:10:18.109 --> 04:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
to move forward with that so that'll
 
04:10:19.990 --> 04:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
take a little bit out of the 18 million
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
before it goes back although I think
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's achieved some interest so it should
 
04:10:26.349 --> 04:10:26.359 align:start position:0%
wash out um that's going back to the
 
04:10:29.429 --> 04:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
general fund and then Governor aot
 
04:10:31.109 --> 04:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
realizing that's going back to the
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
general fund put in the 20 million that
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today and we're
 
04:10:38.149 --> 04:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
explaining to you that that's not going
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
to be enough as is does that help it
 
04:10:44.109 --> 04:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
does and and you actually clarified when
 
04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
you added that 15 to the 18 about the 33
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
million total had I had heard you say
 
04:10:50.429 --> 04:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
that but with the three numbers I just
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure what it is so along
 
04:10:56.189 --> 04:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
with that then when what how much money
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
do you need to get to where we can feel
 
04:11:01.389 --> 04:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable with with what you need to
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
complete the project and when would that
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh be
 
04:11:09.070 --> 04:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
forthcoming well um so the the the
 
04:11:10.830 --> 04:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
structural engineering assessment that
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
the commissioner was just speaking to is
 
04:11:13.950 --> 04:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
going to be starting to to to happen
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
this this spring and summer uh so
 
04:11:18.429 --> 04:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
through that by probably by late summer
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
we will have more data available to us
 
04:11:22.750 --> 04:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
to that we can then reincorporate that
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
into our bid specifications for the
 
04:11:27.189 --> 04:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
larger project but I I think it's safe
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
to say that this is going to be a $30
 
04:11:32.070 --> 04:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
million project I think if it if it ends
 
04:11:35.550 --> 04:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
up being 35 I think some of the internal
 
04:11:37.950 --> 04:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
solutions that through our own agency
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
income and federal grants that we can we
 
04:11:41.790 --> 04:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
can probably come up with a with a five
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
million within our own agency um if
 
04:11:46.349 --> 04:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to be what it takes to to
 
04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
get this project over the goal line uh
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
the 20 that we have now is is is is
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
short um so I would say 30 million is
 
04:11:56.149 --> 04:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
really the number that we're we're
 
04:11:58.950 --> 04:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
hoping to get to um and again my the
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
other opport other ways to potentially
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
if it's not through Capital
 
04:12:03.990 --> 04:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation then perhaps there's other
 
04:12:06.109 --> 04:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
means to do that quick followup Mr
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
chairman followup so with this new work
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we're doing now with looking at the
 
04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
towers and the information you got from
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
that second bidder do you think we're
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get more than one
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
bidder on this project now yes that that
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
was really the whole goal in part of
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
this exercise as well too to have some
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
competition within within the bids yes
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
alone thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
particular taking my question so on the
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
revenue side have you considered raising
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
rates to be a part of this process of
 
04:12:40.830 --> 04:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
solving the problem and if so what what
 
04:12:41.950 --> 04:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
are you what are you talking about in
 
04:12:45.550 --> 04:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
terms of of bottom line figures yes
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
great question so yes we have considered
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
that um as as I think most folks know so
 
04:12:52.990 --> 04:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
the way that the park system is operated
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
is operationally we're self-funded so
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
all the revenue that we generate goes
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
back into the operation and there's
 
04:13:01.950 --> 04:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
certain levels of Maintenance and and
 
04:13:03.550 --> 04:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
upkeep that are that are part of the
 
04:13:05.109 --> 04:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain operation that happened
 
04:13:07.269 --> 04:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
through their operating dollars but the
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
capital side of things whether it's for
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
new bathroom buildings new parking lots
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
new ski lifts is separate from our
 
04:13:19.469 --> 04:13:19.479 align:start position:0%
operating budget so there is not um
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
really a
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism where we're um taking Revenue
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
um that from our operating budget and
 
04:13:28.750 --> 04:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
putting it towards capital budget
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
however the like the seaw wall at
 
04:13:31.870 --> 04:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
Hampton that I just mentioned is an
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
example where there is there was a
 
04:13:36.510 --> 04:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism created to do that if we were
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
for example to increase the rider uh
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
cost by another couple of dollars or
 
04:13:44.109 --> 04:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
another $5 dollar per person to ride
 
04:13:47.469 --> 04:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
that is a an opportunity to U absorb
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
some of the costs that can go back into
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
this and again if you look at you know
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
the 40-year lifespan of of this project
 
04:13:57.189 --> 04:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
if it's generating just itself a million
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
and a half dollars a year um this this
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
this well it's a large investment
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
upfront um we should be you know if it's
 
04:14:07.070 --> 04:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
something that we want to sustain which
 
04:14:08.550 --> 04:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
I would hope that everybody would think
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
that if it's something that's been part
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's Legacy for close to a
 
04:14:13.950 --> 04:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
100 years now that we would like to see
 
04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
the next version of that uh for our
 
04:14:19.109 --> 04:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
children for our grandchildren that it
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
um that we we plan a little further uh
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
ahead of you know predicting those costs
 
04:14:26.189 --> 04:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
our new management structure is doing a
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
lot of work relative to um our Capital
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh needs at ATA at Frank conin and Canon
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
mountain and and forecasting that out I
 
04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of faith in what the the
 
04:14:38.750 --> 04:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
the future holds for us to get out in
 
04:14:40.630 --> 04:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
front of those things but ultimately all
 
04:14:42.510 --> 04:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
of our requests come back through here
 
04:14:45.149 --> 04:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
to to the legislature so we need your
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
support for there but I think to answer
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
your question yes there there's some
 
04:14:51.109 --> 04:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
options for us to offset the cost of
 
04:14:53.950 --> 04:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
this project or to get it uh um payback
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
more in some formula through increasing
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of uh
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
visitation I think we're going to close
 
04:15:03.309 --> 04:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
the uh door on the Canon Mountain
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions for right now I think they've
 
04:15:04.960 --> 04:15:07.189 align:start position:0%
questions for right now I think they've
all

04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:09.790 --> 04:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
been we're we're all just P facing a
 
04:15:12.309 --> 04:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
pitiful shortfall at this point in time
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
so let's move on um to your other items
 
04:15:20.189 --> 04:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
04:15:23.309 --> 04:15:23.319 align:start position:0%
um why don't we keep you here Brian sure
 
04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
um and we can talk through uh the park
 
04:15:29.389 --> 04:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
priorities and uh as you can see I the
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
reason I included the list of 11 items
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
is just to to give you a sense of how we
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
the agency organized our priorities it's
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
a little different than how the governor
 
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
um uh organized her Capital priorities
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
um but but I thought you'd be interested
 
04:15:47.950 --> 04:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
in in hearing why um we want to maintain
 
04:15:50.109 --> 04:15:50.119 align:start position:0%
something like a roofing and repairs
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
fund which is something that we've
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
worked out with this um uh this
 
04:15:56.469 --> 04:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee over the years so that we're
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
Nimble and we can react to um all the
 
04:16:02.349 --> 04:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
fun things that happen at a state park
 
04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
um with storms and toilets and uh culs
 
04:16:08.830 --> 04:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll let Brian speak to the
 
04:16:11.830 --> 04:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
additional priorities behind the Tramway
 
04:16:13.710 --> 04:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
that are important from the Parks Parks
 
04:16:15.790 --> 04:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
perspective and then we can talk about
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
forest and lands sure um well I will
 
04:16:22.030 --> 04:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
start with the two projects that were uh
 
04:16:24.030 --> 04:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
put in in the governor's uh Capital
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
requests uh which were um on bog State
 
04:16:30.750 --> 04:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
Park uh for some Marina and facility
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
improvements um there was uh 600 and uh
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry
 
04:16:39.309 --> 04:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
400 looking at the wrong what our
 
04:16:46.109 --> 04:16:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
I believe it was like 450 um 475 five
 
04:16:53.189 --> 04:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
475 475 thank you like price is right
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
here for a second um 475 uh for um uh
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
Marina improvements if you're uh not
 
04:17:01.269 --> 04:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with AOG State Park we have a
 
04:17:03.750 --> 04:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
campground and a waterfront uh state
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
park facility uh that has a a small
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
modest Marina on the waterfront where we
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
provide uh both public boat access but
 
04:17:15.389 --> 04:17:15.399 align:start position:0%
we also uh operate a a uh uh a boat taxi
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
service to remote campsites that we have
 
04:17:20.349 --> 04:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
uh located all throughout the lake uh
 
04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
and and on some islands on the the
 
04:17:23.950 --> 04:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
middle of Lake it's absolutely
 
04:17:27.389 --> 04:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
spectacular experience uh up in the umag
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
wilderness um and the other project that
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
it was included in the governor's budget
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
um was $1.5 Million for uh Road repairs
 
04:17:38.429 --> 04:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
to the Connecticut head uh Connecticut
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
Lakes Headwaters property uh last bium
 
04:17:44.910 --> 04:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
we also received 1.5 $5 million um with
 
04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
that uh so far uh at the end of the 2024
 
04:17:51.309 --> 04:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
construction season uh we have
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
resurfaced um about 25 miles of of road
 
04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
with a gravel top what we were you doing
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
was um accessing gravel uh from the
 
04:18:03.389 --> 04:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
property owner uh on site it was being
 
04:18:06.149 --> 04:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
processed on site and trucked throughout
 
04:18:09.189 --> 04:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh we have over 260 miles of Roads uh
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the Connecticut Lakes
 
04:18:13.229 --> 04:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
Headwaters property that dncr owns and
 
04:18:16.229 --> 04:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
manages for um Rec primarily for
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
recreational and public access it also
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
serves a function for uh logging jobs uh
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
that occur on that and we work closely
 
04:18:25.070 --> 04:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
with the property owner on
 
04:18:26.590 --> 04:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
prioritization of where Road
 
04:18:30.550 --> 04:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
improvements need to take place um in uh
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
this past year we've seen uh a number of
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh very significant rainstorms and
 
04:18:38.349 --> 04:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
flooding events that occurred uh really
 
04:18:39.990 --> 04:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but on the property
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
that uh uh continue to uh erode can
 
04:18:44.590 --> 04:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
compromise certain areas of the road and
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
our team is working through um upsizing
 
04:18:49.870 --> 04:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
culverts um working through engineering
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
and permitting processes there's
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
actually a few wash outs that are so
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
large that we won't we likely be going
 
04:18:57.389 --> 04:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
to put in in a bridge instead of having
 
04:19:00.309 --> 04:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
a culbert in uh to uh kind of upscale
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
our re level of resiliency on the
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
property um so those are the two
 
04:19:06.670 --> 04:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
projects that are included in the budget
 
04:19:08.910 --> 04:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
what I will point out is those were our
 
04:19:12.269 --> 04:19:12.279 align:start position:0%
two lowest priorities within our agency
 
04:19:12.279 --> 04:19:13.349 align:start position:0%
two lowest priorities within our agency
request

04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to speak to any of the
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
other projects in between but the one
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
that I really think is important uh to
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
he today is the roofing and repairs fund
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh account that the commissioner
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh usually on a biannual basis
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're usually getting a million
 
04:19:31.550 --> 04:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
or2 million do uh that is a for
 
04:19:34.030 --> 04:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide both the division of forest
 
04:19:35.950 --> 04:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
lands and the division of parks
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so that is for uh our our
 
04:19:41.149 --> 04:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
constant kind of roofing uh and general
 
04:19:42.670 --> 04:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
repairs we could be painting build
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
buildings of a large scale at a you know
 
04:19:47.309 --> 04:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
at a contractor level um they could be
 
04:19:49.990 --> 04:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
for large SE SE septic failures we've
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
had trees falling and breaking roofs uh
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
and other things like that it's usually
 
04:19:57.389 --> 04:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
mostly for emergent uh circumstances to
 
04:20:00.109 --> 04:20:00.119 align:start position:0%
keep those facilities open and running
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh septic system failures and and things
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
of that nature uh this past year we used
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
a significant portion of that to restore
 
04:20:10.510 --> 04:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
Northampton State beach after a storm uh
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
last January basically wiped out half
 
04:20:15.149 --> 04:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
the entire parking lot um we did get
 
04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement through FEMA for that but
 
04:20:19.229 --> 04:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
there was no funds available within the
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
agency to actually respond and repair
 
04:20:23.389 --> 04:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
for that other than our Roofing and
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
repairs account so that's where uh the
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentions us our ability to
 
04:20:30.910 --> 04:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
be nimble that that is a a really key uh
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
project for us the last thing I'll do is
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
just also point out um on here we had a
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
request for um roads and parking lots
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
for $4
 
04:20:42.269 --> 04:20:42.279 align:start position:0%
million um while the Connecticut Lakes
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
property is is extremely important es
 
04:20:47.109 --> 04:20:47.119 align:start position:0%
especially for the North country and um
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
we were able to do a lot last by ANM
 
04:20:51.189 --> 04:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
with the appropriation that we received
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
um it it shouldn't go unnoticed that uh
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of our Park visitors are
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
coming to a lot of our parks that are
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
paved and have uh hardtop parking lots
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
and other infrastructure with storm
 
04:21:06.429 --> 04:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
water uh needs and other things um all
 
04:21:09.389 --> 04:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
of which are in varying degrees of Decay
 
04:21:11.950 --> 04:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
um and so if I as director I'm looking
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
at priorities iing you know where is the
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
biggest need I first think about where
 
04:21:18.189 --> 04:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
is the biggest amount of visitation and
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
constituents coming um and what are the
 
04:21:23.070 --> 04:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
conditions at those facilities um and
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
have to you know prioritize in in in
 
04:21:27.630 --> 04:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
that sense so um with
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much for your
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
presentation and if you don't mind I
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
think and I want to float this out for
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
the uh committee here when we do our
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
work session on our on this particular
 
04:21:43.109 --> 04:21:43.119 align:start position:0%
Department would you mind coming back um
 
04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can discuss your priorities a
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
little bit further than what's in the
 
04:21:49.630 --> 04:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
04:21:52.189 --> 04:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
already yes we can absolutely do that
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to thank you um before I
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
close out our agency can we speak um
 
04:22:00.109 --> 04:22:00.119 align:start position:0%
briefly about an ongoing project at our
 
04:22:01.950 --> 04:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
state Nursery Brian you you are
 
04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
dismissed and I'll call Patrick Hackley
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
up certainly um so the state Nursery H
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
have you any of you been it's in bosin
 
04:22:11.149 --> 04:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a historic site in and of
 
04:22:14.670 --> 04:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
itself it's um I'll let Patrick get into
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
the weeds no pun intended Patrick um but
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a revenue generator for
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
us and it is I believe the oldest
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
continuously operating
 
04:22:27.149 --> 04:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
Nursery in in the Northeast in the
 
04:22:29.229 --> 04:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
Northeast one of the last state
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
nurseries in the in the region um so my
 
04:22:33.790 --> 04:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
name is Patrick Hackley I'm the director
 
04:22:36.990 --> 04:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
for the division of forest and lands um
 
04:22:39.149 --> 04:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
yeah the the state Nursery in bosin was
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh constructed in
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
1910 and I don't know how old the cooler
 
04:22:45.189 --> 04:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
room is but I can tell you that it's
 
04:22:46.590 --> 04:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
lined with
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
cork so we've been using that cooler
 
04:22:52.990 --> 04:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
room to sustain a a $250 to $300,000
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
business for the state this generates
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue that pays for two full-time
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
staff um uh a Forester and a maintenance
 
04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
jack of all trades individual who who
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
does everything from the sprinkler
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
system to helps with the planting and
 
04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
sorting and
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
shipping um it's it's really a wonderful
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
tradition but it's also a profit Center
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
for our division we're only about I
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
would say 28% generally funded um nearly
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
60% of our funds come from generating
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
other income and that includes seedlings
 
04:23:28.510 --> 04:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
at the state Nursery um we have a very
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
we've had some record years 300,000 is
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a record for us last year due to
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
frost so just like farmers were exposed
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
to all elements of these crazy Wild
 
04:23:41.950 --> 04:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
Winters and and hot or dry Summers um we
 
04:23:44.710 --> 04:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
had that a late May Frost if you all
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
recall a couple years ago that nipped a
 
04:23:49.229 --> 04:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
lot of our red oak seedlings um as well
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
as our Balsam fur which is our our most
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
popular uh species to sell uh so our
 
04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
revenues were down last year about 189
 
04:23:58.990 --> 04:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
to n about
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
190,000 um but um or orders we sell out
 
04:24:04.950 --> 04:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
within months of opening our online
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
store um it's been a very um positive
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
trend for us the last few years with h
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
concerns about climate mitigation
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of nonprofits buying
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
seedlings a lot of people getting into
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
Christmas tree growing that's one of our
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
biggest clientele we sell seedlings all
 
04:24:23.229 --> 04:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
over the country but we're one of the
 
04:24:25.229 --> 04:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
biggest providers of wholesale seedlings
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
to U uh Christmas tree Growers including
 
04:24:30.030 --> 04:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
executive counselor wheeler he he buys
 
04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
our seedlings so um so anyway it's it's
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
overdue we've um we we replac the
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
irrigation system last year with arpa
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
funding it's now a state-of-the-art um
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
irrigation system system that the
 
04:24:45.429 --> 04:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
manager can control on his cell phone
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
with with software uh as needed when
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
when uh when the seedlings need uh to be
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
watered so we're we're making these
 
04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
incremental Capital Improvements and
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
this next stage is about a 2.5 million
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
dollar project and we're in the design
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're right in the midst or
 
04:25:04.550 --> 04:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
commencing the design phase right now
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
which should be completed by early
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
summer and then the construction phase
 
04:25:11.870 --> 04:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
should get us into the fall of 20 this
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
this fall actually it may drip into
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
2026 but that's that's no the this
 
04:25:23.429 --> 04:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's arpa funding but what
 
04:25:25.389 --> 04:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
we what we're concerned about is in this
 
04:25:27.870 --> 04:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
next um fiscal year
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
2627 um in the governor's budget um it
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
was zeroed out the the force and lands
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
facilities line up was zeroed out our
 
04:25:38.830 --> 04:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
concern is that that doesn't leave us
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
any contingency should the construction
 
04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
encounter some cost increase or
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
materials so that that's where you know
 
04:25:50.349 --> 04:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
we would ask for your consideration and
 
04:25:52.349 --> 04:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
that we leave something in the in the
 
04:25:54.309 --> 04:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
tank so to speak for the next fiscal
 
04:25:57.670 --> 04:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
year if we need to pull from that um we
 
04:26:00.189 --> 04:26:00.199 align:start position:0%
would get this this Capital Improvement
 
04:26:00.199 --> 04:26:01.269 align:start position:0%
would get this this Capital Improvement
uh

04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
completed but the 2.5 million is already
 
04:26:07.790 --> 04:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
we already have the 2.5 but the
 
04:26:09.389 --> 04:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
preliminary cost estimates from the
 
04:26:13.229 --> 04:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
contractor place works is on the low end
 
04:26:15.870 --> 04:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
2.6 on the high end about
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
2.9 so there's that Delta that we're
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about if we don't have uh
 
04:26:22.750 --> 04:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
anything in that in the following
 
04:26:22.760 --> 04:26:26.510 align:start position:0%
anything in that in the following
capital

04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:29.389 --> 04:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
budget I didn't see anything in the
 
04:26:32.269 --> 04:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
package with that did I did I miss that
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
is is it in here we have a brief
 
04:26:36.510 --> 04:26:36.520 align:start position:0%

we'll talk about our current case
 
04:29:47.710 --> 04:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
management system is about 20 years old
 
04:29:50.389 --> 04:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
at this point and it is becoming
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
obsolete or very soon will be obsolete
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%

04:30:29.590 --> 04:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Justice um I

handle the doj's uh day-to-day
 
04:30:34.269 --> 04:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructural and it needs in t with
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
doit uh we work together on a daily
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
basis we have uh the wonderful Miss
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Bolton um from doit here to also

04:30:48.030 --> 04:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
I've been in this role for almost two
 
04:30:50.590 --> 04:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
years and uh one of my main goals uh
 
04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
since being hired by the doj uh has been
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
to replace our case management system
 
04:30:56.109 --> 04:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
which is the impetus for this cap
 
04:30:58.750 --> 04:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
capital request so um before we go to
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
Brass tax let me first explain what a
 
04:31:02.550 --> 04:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
case management system is if we can go
 
04:31:05.189 --> 04:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
to the next slide um the functions of a
 
04:31:06.750 --> 04:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
case management system are ostensibly
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
that they allow law firms and legal
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
entities to store access and edit files
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
and information related to cases this
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
information uh can be case numbers can
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
be Personnel information outcomes
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
litigation information as well as actual
 
04:31:23.469 --> 04:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
documents uh evidence what have you um
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
case management systems interact with a
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
Microsoft SQL database um this database
 
04:31:30.670 --> 04:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh is currently being hosted by the
 
04:31:33.469 --> 04:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
department of it they have expressed to
 
04:31:36.910 --> 04:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
us that um while they're happy to host
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
the server they would prefer if we uh
 
04:31:41.950 --> 04:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
swapped over to a Cloud Server uh
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
instead just for security reasons um so
 
04:31:48.189 --> 04:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
uh the case management system uh is the
 
04:31:49.750 --> 04:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
main file cabinet and the work
 
04:31:52.149 --> 04:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
environment for doj employees so it's
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
not just a repository that we dump
 
04:31:58.269 --> 04:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
documents into for U for posterity it is
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh the first thing that our attorneys
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
and paralegals open up when they get to
 
04:32:04.429 --> 04:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
work and it's the last thing that they
 
04:32:08.550 --> 04:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
close when they clock out um so the case
 
04:32:11.309 --> 04:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
management system doesn't just include
 
04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh file storage it also includes other
 
04:32:15.630 --> 04:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
features like timekeeping billing and
 
04:32:18.510 --> 04:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
Reporting um the Medicaid fraud control
 
04:32:20.349 --> 04:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
unit grants management unit charitable
 
04:32:22.109 --> 04:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
trusts unit uh Environmental Protection
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau civil Bureau they all make use of
 
04:32:26.429 --> 04:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
uh this these billing and timekeeping
 
04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
fun functionalities to um keep track of
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
how many man hours ostensibly are being
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh spent to support and represent uh
 
04:32:38.429 --> 04:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
state agencies um and the reporting
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
functionality is also very important for
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid fraud control unit and
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
charitable trust units uh to be able to
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
generate reports and to meet federal
 
04:32:50.189 --> 04:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines um so if you turn to the next
 
04:32:52.830 --> 04:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
slide I'm going to talk about the doj's
 
04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
current case management system uh it is
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
called praw um so praw was uh acquired
 
04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
by the doj in 2004 so 21 years ago for
 
04:33:05.189 --> 04:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
$1.2 million adjusting for inflation
 
04:33:07.949 --> 04:33:07.959 align:start position:0%
that's $2 million today um over the last
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
20 years the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
Justice has paid for various upgrades
 
04:33:14.510 --> 04:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
pra so it we're not using the version
 
04:33:17.750 --> 04:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
from 2004 presently we're using the 2020
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
version um and along the way there's
 
04:33:21.629 --> 04:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
been multiple upgrades as well uh just
 
04:33:24.429 --> 04:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
to keep it current um between doit
 
04:33:27.789 --> 04:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
support uh Personnel licenses and server
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
Hardware as well as uh our uh
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
Consultants our contractors that we use
 
04:33:35.590 --> 04:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
for do for um for praw um the doj spends
 
04:33:39.629 --> 04:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
roughly $400,000 a year on prw um we
 
04:33:40.750 --> 04:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
like I said before we do have a
 
04:33:42.910 --> 04:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
contractor for backend under the hood
 
04:33:44.670 --> 04:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
support whenever a structural change
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be made to prw um and they also
 
04:33:49.510 --> 04:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
help with day-to-day support and they
 
04:33:50.789 --> 04:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
help answer questions that we have with
 
04:33:53.429 --> 04:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
PR so if we turn to the next slide I'm
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
going to talk about why we need to
 
04:33:55.561 --> 04:33:56.629 align:start position:0%
going to talk about why we need to
replace

04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
replace
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
PR so uh simply put prola is at the end
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
of its lifespan um it is it used to be
 
04:34:08.349 --> 04:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
uh owned by Thompson Reuters but um the
 
04:34:10.590 --> 04:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
team that works on it has broken off
 
04:34:12.029 --> 04:34:12.039 align:start position:0%
from Thompson Reuters roughly about a
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
year ago and they were um they were
 
04:34:19.470 --> 04:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
purchased by a um by a private Equity
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
Firm um since then all investment into
 
04:34:25.470 --> 04:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
pra's development has ceased they're not
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
putting any more money into prola and
 
04:34:29.709 --> 04:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
they're also not selling praw to any uh
 
04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
to any new customers um they're
 
04:34:34.670 --> 04:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
basically keeping a skeleton crew uh
 
04:34:37.551 --> 04:34:37.561 align:start position:0%
just on maintenance for praw so u in the
 
04:34:40.109 --> 04:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
future there could be updates for praw
 
04:34:42.070 --> 04:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
just for compatibility but but it's not
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
like it's going to be getting any
 
04:34:44.470 --> 04:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
feature updates or anything in the
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
future um so prw lacks a lot of the
 
04:34:50.109 --> 04:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
features that are Baseline for a lot of
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
case modern case management systems at
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
least um and it lacks features like
 
04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.039 align:start position:0%
plain teex searching ecovery tools and
 
04:34:59.670 --> 04:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to share cases with outside
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
Council as well as mobile access which
 
04:35:03.510 --> 04:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be important for victim witness
 
04:35:06.869 --> 04:35:06.879 align:start position:0%
Advocates um and we could potentially
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
lose functionality uh for praw within
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
the year um prolab has add-ins that work
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
with our Microsoft Office Suite um those
 
04:35:19.390 --> 04:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
add-ins because Microsoft is sunsetting
 
04:35:21.310 --> 04:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
um the platform that those add-ins are
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
on uh could break which would slow down
 
04:35:25.590 --> 04:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of the day-to-day work that our
 
04:35:29.310 --> 04:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys and paral leals do um and uh
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to that it also uh we
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
recently found out that praw also
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet uh new federally mandated
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
performance standards for the Medicaid
 
04:35:40.750 --> 04:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
fraud control unit um this these
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
standards basically mean that on the
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
application side at least prola lacks
 
04:35:47.629 --> 04:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
the auditing uh features uh automatic
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
lockout features application Level
 
04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
encryption features and fire F level uh
 
04:35:53.629 --> 04:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
encryption features that the feds would
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
like our Medicaid Brad control unit to
 
04:35:58.590 --> 04:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
have at least on the application side um
 
04:36:03.070 --> 04:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
so um moving on sure yeah and just to
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
add one thing when David says we could
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
lose some functionality within a year
 
04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean of course everything's
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
just going to stop or we're not going to
 
04:36:11.109 --> 04:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
be able to operate it just means that
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's going to start to get less than
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
ideal so it's going to get worse and and
 
04:36:19.869 --> 04:36:19.879 align:start position:0%
worse right um the only catastrophic um
 
04:36:22.590 --> 04:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
thing that could happen is that uh Prolo
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
becomes too old for uh our Microsoft SQL
 
04:36:29.670 --> 04:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
databases um but there could be upgrades
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
for that there could not so uh either
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
way we'd have to pay for those upgrades
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
um so if we can move to the next slide
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
it's just a simple summary uh as to the
 
04:36:41.629 --> 04:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
benefits of replacing prw so uh with
 
04:36:43.869 --> 04:36:43.879 align:start position:0%
these new modernized tools uh our
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys and paralal would achieve uh
 
04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
increased workflow efficiency um newer
 
04:36:50.670 --> 04:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
Case Management Systems typically
 
04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
include built-in workflow management
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
tools such as inapp messaging and
 
04:36:56.510 --> 04:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
automated workflow Solutions um which
 
04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
would help Grease the wheels so to speak
 
04:37:01.990 --> 04:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
for um for our attorney and and paralal
 
04:37:04.109 --> 04:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
workflows um we would also achieve
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
enhanced database security uh a new case
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
management system would be on the
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
government Cloud um so doit would no
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
longer have to worry about maintaining
 
04:37:13.990 --> 04:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
the security of our database not saying
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
that the is bad at that they're great at
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
that but they've expressed to us at
 
04:37:21.150 --> 04:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
least that uh it would be a better
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
outcome if if our data were hosted on
 
04:37:26.310 --> 04:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
the server or on the cloud sorry um and
 
04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
then finally we could potentially cut
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
other software from our budget uh we
 
04:37:32.590 --> 04:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
currently pay for software like everlaw
 
04:37:35.830 --> 04:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
for ecovery and we also pay for a tool
 
04:37:37.709 --> 04:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
called perceptive search which basically
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
lets us conduct a plain Tech search of
 
04:37:42.349 --> 04:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
our database um we could potentially cut
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
those pieces of software from our budget
 
04:37:45.949 --> 04:37:45.959 align:start position:0%
if the new case management tool already
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
has those features which at least in for
 
04:37:51.310 --> 04:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
PL Tech searching we know that most new
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
case management systems have that
 
04:37:56.230 --> 04:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
feature um if we can move to the next
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
and final slide we'll discuss the cost
 
04:38:02.269 --> 04:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
of a new case management system so the
 
04:38:05.470 --> 04:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
doj estimates uh about a $2.2 million
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
figure for a completely new uh
 
04:38:09.551 --> 04:38:09.561 align:start position:0%
cloud-based case management system this
 
04:38:11.470 --> 04:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
includes initial implementation and
 
04:38:13.510 --> 04:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
three years of startup support this
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
would also include a database transfer
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
of over 20 years of case history so all
 
04:38:21.910 --> 04:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
the dozens or hundreds of uh terabytes
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
of case information that we have on our
 
04:38:25.109 --> 04:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
current database would all have to be
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
moved over to the cloud which is no
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
small feat uh the $2.2 million figure uh
 
04:38:32.230 --> 04:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
comes from a contractor estimate which
 
04:38:34.470 --> 04:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
also tracks with what we paid for praw
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
in 2004 as well as what other states
 
04:38:39.670 --> 04:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
such as uh such as Maine Vermont and
 
04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
Oregon um project that they'll have to
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
pay for a new case management system as
 
04:38:44.160 --> 04:38:45.709 align:start position:0%
pay for a new case management system as
well

04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:38:49.709 --> 04:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
um now this figure would include the
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
development and customization of a um of
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
a new solution uh testing of course uh
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
cloud storage training uh maintenance
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
user licenses this should be all
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
inclusive um this is again consistent
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
with what other state AG's offices uh
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
have paid or believe they will pay um
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
and this would also include the first
 
04:39:13.470 --> 04:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
two to three years of Maintenance and
 
04:39:17.551 --> 04:39:17.561 align:start position:0%
data storage as well um now the project
 
04:39:20.269 --> 04:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
length including the RFP process should
 
04:39:23.150 --> 04:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
take about three to five years which
 
04:39:26.310 --> 04:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
also coincides with roughly how long we
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
believe uh prw will last us at least on
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
its current version version um that
 
04:39:33.109 --> 04:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
concludes the
 
04:39:35.830 --> 04:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
presentation representative Jack thank
 
04:39:37.868 --> 04:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for coming
 
04:39:39.628 --> 04:39:39.638 align:start position:0%
uh am I to understand you talk about
 
04:39:41.590 --> 04:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
other states am I to understand that
 
04:39:43.150 --> 04:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
every other state is rolling their own
 
04:39:45.628 --> 04:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
there is nothing off the shelf that uh
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
you can up that you can migrate to
 
04:39:48.990 --> 04:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's actually a really really good
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
question so uh currently there is no
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
Miracle product for a case management
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
system um I mean there are at least in
 
04:39:59.830 --> 04:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
the private world you know there's
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions like legal files that are very
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
popular but when it comes to State AG's
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
offices since our needs are so varied um
 
04:40:11.350 --> 04:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
from state to state um there's no Sol
 
04:40:13.628 --> 04:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
solution that just works off the shelf
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to require customization it's
 
04:40:17.948 --> 04:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
going to require uh time from the vendor
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
to um to to to mold it ostensibly to our
 
04:40:23.310 --> 04:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
needs representative
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:40:28.030 --> 04:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you indicate on
 
04:40:31.628 --> 04:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
your last page of your uh presentation
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
that the 2.2 million figure will include
 
04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
two to three years of Maintenance and
 
04:40:37.110 --> 04:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
data storage does that also
 
04:40:39.708 --> 04:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
include um access to a help desk that
 
04:40:42.430 --> 04:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
would assist you with the software
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
management and any any other things that
 
04:40:46.910 --> 04:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
would yes sir that is correct okay
 
04:40:49.948 --> 04:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair follow up in that
 
04:40:52.030 --> 04:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
regard have you coordinated with the
 
04:40:54.430 --> 04:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology for
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
when that maintenance agreement is up
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to step in and
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
be able to assist you if you had similar
 
04:41:03.390 --> 04:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances occur with the technology
 
04:41:06.110 --> 04:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
moving forward or do you anticipate uh
 
04:41:08.190 --> 04:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
buying a lack of a better word and
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
extended warranty on the product to
 
04:41:12.750 --> 04:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
continue that level of uh maintenance
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
and help us assess that access that you
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
need thank you that's a good question so
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
doit and I have been in lockstep uh on
 
04:41:24.430 --> 04:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
this project uh we both are are I mean
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
Rebecca and I meet every every week to
 
04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
talk about this project for at least an
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
hour um and from what we understand um
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
our current our current version of
 
04:41:39.990 --> 04:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
pra could potentially last us one to two
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
years it really depends on when those
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
Comins break and if there's uh if and if
 
04:41:46.350 --> 04:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
there's no compatibility with a new
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
version of say Microsoft SQL servers um
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
but uh we are looking at potentially
 
04:41:56.350 --> 04:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
upgrading praw to uh the 2024 version
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
just to get us going for uh for three to
 
04:42:01.868 --> 04:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
five years while we work on replacing
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
it okay representative
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
pal thank you Mr chairman thank takeing
 
04:42:10.030 --> 04:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
the question how is this going to affect
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
County attorneys I know our County
 
04:42:15.868 --> 04:42:15.878 align:start position:0%
attorney mentioned their problem I mean
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
and also with CMS so how do you think
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
this will affect County Attorney's
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
Office including like Hillsboro County
 
04:42:25.470 --> 04:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
which is biggest right uh we don't use
 
04:42:27.550 --> 04:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
the the I'm sure you know this but uh we
 
04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
don't use the same system as the County
 
04:42:31.948 --> 04:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
attorneys so I mean us updating our case
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
management system shouldn't directly
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
affect them um but if if the new case
 
04:42:40.110 --> 04:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
management system is robust enough uh it
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
could help Grease the wheel in terms of
 
04:42:44.310 --> 04:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh getting information and getting uh
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
Case Files uh to and from these County
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys and the Department of Justice
 
04:42:52.590 --> 04:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
faster repres representative bogert I
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
pass representative Brown thank you Mr
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
04:42:58.590 --> 04:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
along those same lines we're currently
 
04:43:01.390 --> 04:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
updating our system it system in Carol
 
04:43:03.550 --> 04:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
County as well so has there been in any
 
04:43:05.910 --> 04:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
interaction with the county attorney's
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
office about what would be compatible
 
04:43:10.708 --> 04:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
with the systems that you're planning to
 
04:43:12.150 --> 04:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
move forward forward with because I know
 
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
we're we have to do it because of the
 
04:43:16.510 --> 04:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
cloud and the windows issues that are
 
04:43:18.590 --> 04:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
dying basically in November of this year
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
so has that been ongoing so we make sure
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
that maybe the county attorney's office
 
04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to do something that was
 
04:43:26.750 --> 04:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
more effective and more compatible with
 
04:43:28.390 --> 04:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
you since I my understand is I do work
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
with you on a regular basis right uh
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so um we
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken we haven't coordinated
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
with county attorney's offices yet but
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
they will definitely be a part of the
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
process to ensure that all on the same
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
level I know the county attorney's
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
offices like to use prosecutor by carpel
 
04:43:47.230 --> 04:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
there could be a world where we end up
 
04:43:49.230 --> 04:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
on prosecutor by carpel and that would
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
make things um easier for the doj to
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the county attorney's
 
04:43:56.590 --> 04:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
offices but um obviously it's going to
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
have to go out to bid so I I ideally
 
04:44:02.590 --> 04:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
we're on the same system but it could be
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
another case where we're on two separate
 
04:44:06.190 --> 04:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
systems and hopefully if they use at
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
least the same Baseline document
 
04:44:09.868 --> 04:44:09.878 align:start position:0%
management system such as Salesforce
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
then uh it could help our workflow
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
significantly just so you know they'll
 
04:44:16.750 --> 04:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
probably be contacting you thank you
 
04:44:18.270 --> 04:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
look forward to it and and just to
 
04:44:20.070 --> 04:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
supplement yes apologies Mr chair just
 
04:44:22.510 --> 04:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
to supplement that briefly it's
 
04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
important to to note and remember that
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
what we do is a lot broader than what
 
04:44:27.150 --> 04:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
the county attorney's offices do so we
 
04:44:29.150 --> 04:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
do just a lot of things they don't do so
 
04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's another challenge in having say
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
maybe the exact same system but as much
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
compatibility as we can have we agree
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
the better and and the final question is
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
going to representative Newman yes thank
 
04:44:43.230 --> 04:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
you it's it's a it's a three-parter but
 
04:44:46.510 --> 04:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
I'll roll it into one because I'm clever
 
04:44:49.510 --> 04:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay the um other states and I I'll just
 
04:44:51.190 --> 04:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
get it out and you can answer other
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
states use prola now um that's a
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
question and the doj estimate of 2.2
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
million is that a a hard estimate or is
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
it a to be adjusted maybe depending
 
04:45:13.390 --> 04:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
on the way things go and that is um tied
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
in with new federally mandated
 
04:45:18.590 --> 04:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
performance standards are those also a
 
04:45:22.030 --> 04:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
moving Target right now possibly to deal
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
with as you go along so to answer your
 
04:45:28.350 --> 04:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
first question um so not every other
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
state AG's offices uses PR law uh
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
there's a few Hawaii uses PR law Nevada
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
uses PR law California uses PR law but
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
um from what I understand uh all the
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
state AG's offices are all using mostly
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
different solutions and of them can
 
04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
agree on one that's perfect it molds to
 
04:45:46.670 --> 04:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
to the needs of the AG's office in
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
question um I'm sorry remind me of your
 
04:45:52.350 --> 04:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
second question the doj estimate of 2.2
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
million is that a firm number so it's
 
04:45:58.868 --> 04:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
this is just what sorry this is just
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
what one contractor gave us and again
 
04:46:02.350 --> 04:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's in line with what we paid in
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
2004 it could be more it could be less
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
based on the bids that we get we're
 
04:46:07.990 --> 04:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to put out an RFP so we're going
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
to get hopefully a lot of bids um but
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
but this could there we could be in a
 
04:46:16.708 --> 04:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
world where you know we we get a bid for
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
1.5 million and that would be great and
 
04:46:20.830 --> 04:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
if that met all of our business
 
04:46:22.270 --> 04:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
requirements and that would be perfect
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
but we also don't want to be in a
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
position where we go with a um a
 
04:46:28.868 --> 04:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
solution that's a fraction of that $2.2
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
million figure and it also only meets a
 
04:46:32.670 --> 04:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
fraction of our business requirements as
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
theyr yes from what I understand they're
 
04:46:46.990 --> 04:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
set in concrete they're um on their
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
fed's website um they obviously can
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
change as they did for us but it's it I
 
04:46:56.110 --> 04:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily know the frequency at
 
04:46:59.230 --> 04:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.990 --> 04:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
change gentlemen thank you very much for
 
04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.110 --> 04:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
you and we're getting back on schedule
 
04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
next up and I'm with sorry for the delay
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.440 --> 04:47:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
we

04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:23.708 --> 04:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
welcome to public works thank you uh and
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
and you look by far you look like the uh
 
04:48:29.310 --> 04:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
the happiest people that that we have so
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
far you you only had seven requests you
 
04:48:34.230 --> 04:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
got five of them I mean everybody is is
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
going to be envious of yes yes they're
 
04:48:38.350 --> 04:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
small money but important life changes
 
04:48:40.910 --> 04:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
for our veterans um I'll go ahead and
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
start uh we gave you a powerpoint
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
presentation just a little bit about a
 
04:48:46.470 --> 04:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
history the projects we currently have
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
and the ones that we requested um so in
 
04:48:51.788 --> 04:48:51.798 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Veterans Home in 1890
 
04:48:53.070 --> 04:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
took advantage of some federal
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
assistance with Governor Goodell um and
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
established a board of managers made up
 
04:49:00.430 --> 04:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
of prominent citizens the facility
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
opened its doors the first time for
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
Civil War soldiers unable to care for
 
04:49:09.310 --> 04:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
themselves on December 3rd 1890 so we
 
04:49:11.948 --> 04:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
just celebrated uh 35 years in December
 
04:49:15.628 --> 04:49:15.638 align:start position:0%
from the first day um in the 134 or 35
 
04:49:17.708 --> 04:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
years there's been 11 commod Dons that
 
04:49:19.708 --> 04:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
have held the position I'm in right now
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
so it's a traditional very prideful
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
honorable um position in facility we are
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
unique in that we're ran by the board of
 
04:49:30.670 --> 04:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
managers they oversee our operations the
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
board is made up of 12 members who are
 
04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and confirmed
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
by the executive Council the commanders
 
04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
for the American Legion the Veterans of
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
Foreign uh Wars and disabled American
 
04:49:44.470 --> 04:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
veterans and nine citizens make up our
 
04:49:47.548 --> 04:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
Board of managers two of the 12 members
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
of our Board of managers are actual
 
04:49:51.670 --> 04:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
residents that live with us one male one
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
female so they're representing their
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
voice in our meetings the board has
 
04:49:58.548 --> 04:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
oversight of the veterans benefit fund
 
04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
operations as well as appoints the
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
commant today we are a long-term
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
Intermediate Care Facility so some
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes have ICF uh beds
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
intermittent Care Facility or skilled
 
04:50:16.350 --> 04:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
beds we are only ICF we only take uh
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
people who meet long-term
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
criteria uh we offer uh Medical Services
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
nursing services and only to Veterans uh
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
we have licens for
 
04:50:31.548 --> 04:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
250 beds we are funded by uh the um
 
04:50:33.430 --> 04:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
state for
 
04:50:36.868 --> 04:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
225 and recently I think most medical
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
professionals will tell you the the most
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
difficult part right now is Rec
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retaining of medical
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
staff nurses
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
especially we are we utilize the veteran
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
affairs VA Grant that enables us um to
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
receive a majority of our payments um
 
04:50:57.070 --> 04:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
and we are we are uh surveyed annually
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's usually in April I say that because
 
04:51:00.670 --> 04:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
last year was the first time they had
 
04:51:02.948 --> 04:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
missed the mark and we hit May uh but
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
they go through a survey process and
 
04:51:07.390 --> 04:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
certify us to provide services through
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
through the VA and uh eligible for
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
reimburse that's important because
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we have some of our life
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
safety things here the mission of the
 
04:51:17.548 --> 04:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Veterans Home is to
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
provide the provide the best quality of
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
life for New Hampshire veterans with
 
04:51:23.548 --> 04:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
dignity honor and respect and I feel
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
very confident that our staff do that so
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
yes we are Smiley we are happy we work
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
in a great place so we're very proud of
 
04:51:34.110 --> 04:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
that um infrastructure we're looking at
 
04:51:36.510 --> 04:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
veterans uh health and life safety
 
04:51:38.110 --> 04:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
measures we always look at that they
 
04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
come in and do a survey we also have
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
local survey uh look at our systems to
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
make sure we're meeting all of the life
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
safety Health life safety requirements
 
04:51:50.548 --> 04:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
we also must meet ADA requirements which
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
is one of the budget um capital budget
 
04:51:55.510 --> 04:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
projects that did not get funded uh and
 
04:51:57.628 --> 04:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
we mentioned that as far as redoing one
 
04:52:00.548 --> 04:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
of our units the doors are too narrow uh
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
showers are not meeting ADA requirements
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
we also must meet in uh affection and
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
prevention controls as we saw with the
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh covid outbreak it can be devastating
 
04:52:13.470 --> 04:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
in any kind of longterm care or congrate
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
living and we must meet those VA law
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
requirements in the survey requirements
 
04:52:20.350 --> 04:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
to continue to be able to serve the
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
veterans re get that reimbursement from
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
the VA and stay
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
licensed uh the status of our current
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
projects we had F we have five current
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
projects going on one is the state W
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
sitewide drainage and water life safety
 
04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
Improvement project um in parts of our
 
04:52:40.548 --> 04:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
building when the rain comes or the snow
 
04:52:43.788 --> 04:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
melts it comes in our basement and so we
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
are working on that that is underway to
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
try to divert some of that water and
 
04:52:51.670 --> 04:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we have entry life um life
 
04:52:54.430 --> 04:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
safety improvements we have no canopies
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
or no covers over many of our doorways
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
so again with the ice and the and the
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
snow coming off those roofs it becomes
 
04:53:03.708 --> 04:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
very dangerous and we have to close some
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
of our entrances so this will address
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
that bidding will be posted on March
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
25th 2025
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
medical lift installation you will see
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
that on our um budget request again and
 
04:53:17.788 --> 04:53:17.798 align:start position:0%
we call it phase three this time but
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
phase two uh these are lifts that are in
 
04:53:23.070 --> 04:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh inputed into our ceiling to help us
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
move safely the veterans um that cannot
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
help themselves so uh it is for their
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
life safety but also to prevent injury
 
04:53:35.548 --> 04:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
to our staff to help move uh veterans uh
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
throughout their room area and then we
 
04:53:40.190 --> 04:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
have the Veterans Home Building Edition
 
04:53:42.548 --> 04:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
which was originally called the Leo Life
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
Enhancement dementia unit Edition um uh
 
04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
years ago they were planning to build a
 
04:53:51.270 --> 04:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
third floor and uh the government uh the
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
VA approved the project with the state
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
so the VA pays 65% the state has to pay
 
04:54:00.830 --> 04:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
35 um we have had that money encumbered
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh in 2022 we finally got the go from
 
04:54:06.190 --> 04:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
the VA to go ahead and move forward with
 
04:54:09.628 --> 04:54:09.638 align:start position:0%
that project and um we went we developed
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
a a site it could not be on the third
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
floor there were no no longer was that
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
enough money to actually support a third
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
floor addition and I believe the quality
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
of life of a third floor addition would
 
04:54:23.230 --> 04:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
not be the same as a ground floor so we
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
identified area on our facility campus
 
04:54:28.190 --> 04:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
that we could actually um connect our
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
buildings and uh build a first floor
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
with enclosed Courtyards and that those
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
will be 20 beds with 20 private
 
04:54:39.628 --> 04:54:39.638 align:start position:0%
bathrooms I think our veterans deserve
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
not to live with two people in one room
 
04:54:43.628 --> 04:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
two in another and all four of them
 
04:54:45.750 --> 04:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
using a bathroom we also know that that
 
04:54:48.670 --> 04:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
infection prevention um is such a bad
 
04:54:50.590 --> 04:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
practice it will spread any kind of
 
04:54:53.310 --> 04:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
illness whether it's a covid or a flu or
 
04:54:56.190 --> 04:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
any of those other uh illnesses so that
 
04:54:58.350 --> 04:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
project is underway we went out to bid
 
04:55:01.708 --> 04:55:01.718 align:start position:0%
the first time and we got one bid but we
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
were only 30% design and most people
 
04:55:05.708 --> 04:55:05.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to see more design so they could
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
make a a educated decision about a bid
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
so we actually complet completed a 100%
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
design we went out to bid last month or
 
04:55:16.230 --> 04:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
we opened bids last month and we had
 
04:55:19.628 --> 04:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
five um biders and uh it looks really
 
04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
good I think we're going to definitely
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
meet the Target and move forward with
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
that we have been reassured as of
 
04:55:27.510 --> 04:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday I just wanted to update just
 
04:55:30.470 --> 04:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
in case um the VA it is called a
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
construction Grant so I have verified
 
04:55:35.310 --> 04:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
with the VA that that is not at risk uh
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
with the current um cuts that are being
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
made to the um to the federal government
 
04:55:41.948 --> 04:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
so that that money is still there and
 
04:55:44.590 --> 04:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
has been reassured to us and then the
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
last project that's uh ongoing is the
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
parking lot repair and expansion is 80%
 
04:55:53.948 --> 04:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
done we hope to have it done by July 1
 
04:55:56.548 --> 04:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
but our luck has not been so great so we
 
04:55:58.990 --> 04:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
have asked to bring that forward again
 
04:56:01.230 --> 04:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
we uh have just some striping to do in
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
the parking lot and we also have uh a
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of um Courtyard work so uh
 
04:56:10.628 --> 04:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to that
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I was a miss too I'm sorry I just
 
04:56:15.708 --> 04:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to introduce by my side here is
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
Brian Baker he's our chief of operations
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
and he has the most years experience
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
sitting at this table within the VA uh
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
within the New Hampshire veterans home
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
he's been there for 20 plus years so uh
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
he will be able to answer any detailed
 
04:56:31.628 --> 04:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
questions um for our Governor's funded
 
04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
projects this year we have on here this
 
04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
list uh replace three Air Handlers the
 
04:56:40.470 --> 04:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
diesel tank replacement replace seven
 
04:56:43.510 --> 04:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
veteran tubs um and and purchase a
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
bariatric stretcher trolley replace 50
 
04:56:51.270 --> 04:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
beds and 20 medical lifts phase three so
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
on page nine we think the best thing to
 
04:56:55.390 --> 04:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
do is show you photos and show you
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
what's happening up there the air
 
04:57:00.270 --> 04:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
handlers units serve uh three resident
 
04:57:02.590 --> 04:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods with over a 100 Veterans
 
04:57:05.230 --> 04:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
living in them they're now 30 years old
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
with deteriorating parts and due to
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
their age the units are Obsolete and
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
can't be rep reped in attempt last
 
04:57:15.190 --> 04:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
summer during the hot time we got uh we
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
did have a welder come in and make some
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
repairs and try to limp it along um but
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
they only lasted about a month because
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's welded and it's just moving
 
04:57:26.910 --> 04:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
constantly so due to last lack of
 
04:57:28.628 --> 04:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
Integrity in the metal Parts when these
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
units start to shake they violently
 
04:57:32.548 --> 04:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
cause cracks and breaks and you'll see
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
some of those in the photos that we've
 
04:57:38.910 --> 04:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
given you here um on page N9 and 10 so
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
we definitely need to address those when
 
04:57:44.708 --> 04:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
those um no longer work we will lose
 
04:57:47.548 --> 04:57:47.558 align:start position:0%
heating and air conditioning um and that
 
04:57:49.470 --> 04:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
would be devastating to our population
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
at this
 
04:57:54.430 --> 04:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
point the second um priority that was
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
granted by the governor um is and for
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
your consideration is the underground
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
diesel tank replacement and I know we
 
04:58:03.430 --> 04:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
heard some questions about that we have
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
about a 12,000 gallon diesel tank um
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
buried on our property and it's the
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
distance of the fuel that it it goes is
 
04:58:15.868 --> 04:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
about 100 plus feet how how long does it
 
04:58:19.230 --> 04:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
the distance it's about 300t 300 ft it
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
has to travel it used to um have the
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
fuel for all of our generation
 
04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
generators but we went to and what and
 
04:58:28.150 --> 04:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
boilers but we went to natural gas so
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
there's one small generator that still
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
lives off this um Berry diesel tank and
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh we need to empty out the diesel
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
because diesel has a life and we're
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
getting to the ended that life
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
expectancy and then we have to remove
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
the tank and put a new tank closer to
 
04:58:49.230 --> 04:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
the line and um be able to uh generate
 
04:58:52.750 --> 04:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
that uh generator so uh we're asking for
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
a money $60,000 again to take that tank
 
04:58:58.990 --> 04:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
out of the ground replace it um a
 
04:59:00.590 --> 04:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
different location and replace it with a
 
04:59:02.548 --> 04:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
much smaller tank which we will able to
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
use that money that that um diesel in a
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
much quicker way because we use it for
 
04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
testing hopefully we don't really have
 
04:59:12.270 --> 04:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
have to use
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
it uh replace seven uh seven tubs we
 
04:59:18.270 --> 04:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
have tub rooms and these are this is an
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
example of a tub that is used uh they're
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
critical to provide care for our
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
veterans they're critical and what's
 
04:59:27.390 --> 04:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
been happening is they've all aged out
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the company's not making them or
 
04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
supporting them so what we've started to
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
do is on units that we don't have uh
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
residents we are actually pirating off
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
those parts and rep putting putting them
 
04:59:40.868 --> 04:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
on the other tubs to to try to limp them
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
along um it we're in dire need of of
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
replacing the tubs um obviously that's a
 
04:59:49.868 --> 04:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
a quality of life that can't be avoided
 
04:59:52.150 --> 04:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to B the veterans and
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
then we are wanted to purchase one
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
bariatric stretcher trolley which on
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
page 13 shows you a picture of that and
 
05:00:01.030 --> 05:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
it will allow us to be the residents
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
that um that need the bariatric care in
 
05:00:06.670 --> 05:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
a much safer way these tubs even the
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
bariatric ones are often not big enough
 
05:00:12.830 --> 05:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
for uh a true bariatric resident so we
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.830 --> 05:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
well replace 50 resident beds um these
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
are the actual beds often what we think
 
05:00:25.628 --> 05:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
of like a hospital bed um our beds are
 
05:00:28.030 --> 05:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
so old that they have a knee Locking
 
05:00:30.230 --> 05:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
System where you actually use your knee
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
to push the lock on um instead of a foot
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
break and so what's happening is people
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
are using their knees to lock this and
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of iny that happens um
 
05:00:44.190 --> 05:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
some have to it's so hard to do it
 
05:00:45.990 --> 05:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're actually using their bodies to
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
try their hands to try to lock them we
 
05:00:51.070 --> 05:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
need to replace these uh and again this
 
05:00:53.310 --> 05:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
will be the similar approach I would
 
05:00:55.948 --> 05:00:55.958 align:start position:0%
have is to do that in phases so we can
 
05:00:58.150 --> 05:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
phase out the most
 
05:01:00.910 --> 05:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh the the worst beds I guess I would
 
05:01:03.390 --> 05:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
say um and put the need where they need
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
and then make sure we're never asking
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
for too much we'll do phasing it all in
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
um the goal is to replace them each uh
 
05:01:13.390 --> 05:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
each bium uh the VA requires us to
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
annually test our beds and ensure that
 
05:01:17.788 --> 05:01:17.798 align:start position:0%
they're in good working order and we've
 
05:01:19.948 --> 05:01:19.958 align:start position:0%
had to take some out just because of age
 
05:01:22.750 --> 05:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
the wires are not good the plugs are not
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
good they're just not healthy so we
 
05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
definitely need uh the bed
 
05:01:30.190 --> 05:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
Replacements we are also asking for
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
phase three of these medical lifts and
 
05:01:33.750 --> 05:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is an example of that
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
lift right now when somebody is coming
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
into our facility if a veteran is going
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
to be emitted and has um a need to be
 
05:01:42.990 --> 05:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
lifted uh they can't they need a
 
05:01:46.190 --> 05:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
two-person lift um we have to place them
 
05:01:48.190 --> 05:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
within our facility according to where
 
05:01:50.110 --> 05:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
we have lifts not where the best
 
05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
programming may be for them but we have
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
to look at where do we have lifts that
 
05:01:56.910 --> 05:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
we can actually move them safely or we
 
05:02:00.270 --> 05:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
have to use portable lifts which are um
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
inherently not the best way to do that
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
you can have a lot of uh you know
 
05:02:06.350 --> 05:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
accidents with a portable lift so this
 
05:02:09.150 --> 05:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
is phase two uh phase three uh right now
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
we have 38 rooms would lifts and we have
 
05:02:14.750 --> 05:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
four bathrooms but we would like to
 
05:02:16.548 --> 05:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
increase that number and not have to
 
05:02:18.590 --> 05:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
make a room decision based on where
 
05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:27.150 --> 05:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
veteran so uh slide 16 is again just the
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at um we hope that
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
the water drainage uh life safety will
 
05:02:35.030 --> 05:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
be done by the Summer
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
2005 we're hoping the entry will
 
05:02:40.350 --> 05:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
actually be done before uh June 30 but
 
05:02:42.110 --> 05:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
we just don't know that so we're
 
05:02:45.030 --> 05:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
actually leaving that on for summer 2025
 
05:02:46.708 --> 05:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
we're asking to bring all projects
 
05:02:50.110 --> 05:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
forward uh the the addition is well
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
underway we're hoping that uh we'll be
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
breaking ground this summer with a year
 
05:02:57.070 --> 05:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
and a half um they say a year but my
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
experience with any kind of construction
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
is at six months so we're realistically
 
05:03:03.430 --> 05:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
thinking a year and a half and then the
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
parking lot upgrades um we're we're so
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
close to being done we're hoping that
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
will be done as well as this summer um
 
05:03:12.750 --> 05:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
so we're have a tradition of providing
 
05:03:15.030 --> 05:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
the best care uh to the veterans of the
 
05:03:16.590 --> 05:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire we're really
 
05:03:19.270 --> 05:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
proud of that um and with your support
 
05:03:22.110 --> 05:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
we hope to continue um representative
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
Jack for uh thank you if I understood
 
05:03:25.230 --> 05:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
you correctly we're not bringing forward
 
05:03:27.310 --> 05:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
the medical Phase 2 because that's
 
05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
complete it's complete sir uh do we know
 
05:03:30.990 --> 05:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
if there's any balance left in that
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
account I believe it was uh under $200
 
05:03:40.788 --> 05:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
okay we are Yankees representative Boyd
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman comment on thank
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you are the
 
05:03:47.390 --> 05:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
third agency that is before us that is
 
05:03:49.070 --> 05:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
looking to replace an underground diesel
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
tank so I get to ask my question for the
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
third time okay and we did hear it so
 
05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay so if you've heard the question can
 
05:03:57.750 --> 05:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
you answer the qu actually for the for
 
05:03:59.868 --> 05:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
the for the people watching at home is
 
05:04:02.110 --> 05:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
it possible for the tank to be either
 
05:04:04.548 --> 05:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
filled with cement or sand and then cap
 
05:04:06.830 --> 05:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
to avoid removing the tank so I did I
 
05:04:09.310 --> 05:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
made the call to the EPA to to ask that
 
05:04:10.628 --> 05:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
very question question and they inform
 
05:04:12.788 --> 05:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
me that the new guidelines they don't
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
allow it so it has to be removed so the
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
old way of doing it was we'd scrub it
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
with a detergent fill it with concrete
 
05:04:21.390 --> 05:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
they do not allow that anymore unless
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
there is a extenuating circumstance
 
05:04:25.948 --> 05:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
where you cannot get to it but ours is
 
05:04:29.350 --> 05:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
kind of open so we really don't fit that
 
05:04:32.470 --> 05:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
mold okay ask and answer thank you well
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
I have a little followup on it because I
 
05:04:36.190 --> 05:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
having been on this committee for so
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
long and seeing some of these things
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again this isn't
 
05:04:41.350 --> 05:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
the first time we've talked about this
 
05:04:43.590 --> 05:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
tank is it it is not didn't didn't we
 
05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
move it once before did it did it get
 
05:04:47.548 --> 05:04:47.558 align:start position:0%
scrubbed from your project list we moved
 
05:04:49.150 --> 05:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
it because we were looking at trying to
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
upgrade our generator to natural gas
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
because we have natural gas so we moved
 
05:04:55.708 --> 05:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
this once before so you could put more
 
05:04:57.310 --> 05:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
generators in so now we're going to
 
05:04:59.150 --> 05:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
remove it because you got rid of
 
05:05:01.390 --> 05:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
generators well no so we weren't able to
 
05:05:03.430 --> 05:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
so we the supplier would not allow us to
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
add more um units to the natural gas
 
05:05:08.430 --> 05:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
supply so now we're back to sticking
 
05:05:10.510 --> 05:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
with diesel
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.470 --> 05:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
um what phase are we on we're on phase
 
05:05:22.990 --> 05:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
three for your medical lift
 
05:05:24.670 --> 05:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
installations how many more
 
05:05:26.910 --> 05:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
phases um well with the addition that
 
05:05:28.030 --> 05:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to be building there's going
 
05:05:29.948 --> 05:05:29.958 align:start position:0%
to be 20 lifts we put that in that
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
addition we're not we ask for that right
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
away so with that 20 and the 42 we
 
05:05:37.990 --> 05:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
already have and if you gave us 20 more
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
we'd be probably looking at on honestly
 
05:05:41.470 --> 05:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
if I'm being truthful I'd probably back
 
05:05:43.470 --> 05:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
one more time to ask for another phase
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
of it because we want the majority of
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
the beds to be covered and we have 250
 
05:05:49.470 --> 05:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
beds you're to be you're to be commended
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
you guys always come in here in little
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
increments and stuff that's why I I keep
 
05:05:54.350 --> 05:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the same stuff every two
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
years going okay and I believe I was
 
05:05:58.270 --> 05:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
asked last year are you going to come
 
05:06:00.270 --> 05:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
back every year every two years and I
 
05:06:02.230 --> 05:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
said yes I would for a while there's
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
small I mean our overall ask is very
 
05:06:07.628 --> 05:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
small but they're big projects to us in
 
05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
our smaller budget representa bone thank
 
05:06:13.310 --> 05:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you I've been
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
to your facility some years ago as a
 
05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire Patriot God
 
05:06:20.350 --> 05:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
excellent and you do a great job and I
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
just want to come in thank you so much
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representa boy I'm I'm sorry
 
05:06:28.708 --> 05:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
represent bogur thank you Mr chairman
 
05:06:31.430 --> 05:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um this
 
05:06:34.270 --> 05:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
is actually a followup to the Chairman's
 
05:06:37.708 --> 05:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
question uh the 20 that you want to do
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
in phase three those are
 
05:06:40.480 --> 05:06:42.510 align:start position:0%
in phase three those are
for

05:06:42.510 --> 05:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:06:46.670 --> 05:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
existing areas and as the second part of
 
05:06:49.230 --> 05:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
that question in your new section that
 
05:06:49.240 --> 05:06:50.190 align:start position:0%
that question in your new section that
you're

05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:06:53.548 --> 05:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
building if you need medical lifts that
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
was put into the cost of the new
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
building so that should be not included
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
in this 20 yes sir so the uh 20 that
 
05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about would go into
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
existing rooms in um what we call our
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
downstairs uh neighborhood there's 100
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
there so we have no lifts down there
 
05:07:13.430 --> 05:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're using portable lifts so we would
 
05:07:16.470 --> 05:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
be putting those 20 down there the new
 
05:07:19.628 --> 05:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
addition which we have not named yet um
 
05:07:21.708 --> 05:07:21.718 align:start position:0%
but that will have 20 beds and one of
 
05:07:23.390 --> 05:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
the things that we put in right away is
 
05:07:25.990 --> 05:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we needed 20 lifts in every room
 
05:07:28.110 --> 05:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
nine of those rooms will actually be
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
bariatric lifts they will be able to
 
05:07:34.110 --> 05:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
sustain um up to 1,000 pounds so we are
 
05:07:35.830 --> 05:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
really like looking into the future
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
saying not only do we need the standard
 
05:07:39.628 --> 05:07:39.638 align:start position:0%
lifts we need some bariatric rooms The
 
05:07:39.638 --> 05:07:40.830 align:start position:0%
lifts we need some bariatric rooms The
Wider

05:07:40.830 --> 05:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
Wider
 
05:07:45.390 --> 05:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
doors and just one followup uh and those
 
05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
were included in the cost of the already
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
yes that that's part of the project I
 
05:07:53.948 --> 05:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
will not be coming to ask for beds in uh
 
05:07:55.708 --> 05:07:55.718 align:start position:0%
lifts in the
 
05:07:58.030 --> 05:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
area any further
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.230 --> 05:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
chair and and thanks for responding to
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
my question there was one item or one of
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
the items uh that are not being covered
 
05:08:15.910 --> 05:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
now that you have listed had to do with
 
05:08:20.670 --> 05:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
the South uh Ada and safety upgrades and
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
reading the uh you know what they are um
 
05:08:26.590 --> 05:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
you really need them to sound like some
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
of them were safety things that you
 
05:08:31.390 --> 05:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
should have yes so we we basically the
 
05:08:33.670 --> 05:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
that that neighborhood uh our group of
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods we've actually moved
 
05:08:37.390 --> 05:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
residents off that neighborhood it's not
 
05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
safe for them to be on their floors
 
05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
tiles popping up uh there some rooms the
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
doors are wider than others uh if you
 
05:08:47.708 --> 05:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
looked at Armor or closet space they're
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
broken it's the it's in really really
 
05:08:54.788 --> 05:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
bad repair um and so we have moved
 
05:08:56.910 --> 05:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
everybody off those units and we're not
 
05:08:59.910 --> 05:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
using them and it is a big ticket item I
 
05:09:03.390 --> 05:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
think it was 1.5 million um we put it on
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
there with the fingers crossed hoping it
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
would get through um but it I would be
 
05:09:10.868 --> 05:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
happy to share uh photos with you I can
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
even send them to you if for your next
 
05:09:15.470 --> 05:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
meeting if you'd like but that area we
 
05:09:18.628 --> 05:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
cannot use that whole area um if we had
 
05:09:20.830 --> 05:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
to use that it I think that we would
 
05:09:23.110 --> 05:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
have problems with our VA survey and our
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
life safety
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
surveys okay thank you thank you thank
 
05:09:31.230 --> 05:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr just just as a followup to that
 
05:09:34.030 --> 05:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
um I said listened to so many of these
 
05:09:36.270 --> 05:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
requests over the years what was the
 
05:09:39.510 --> 05:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
status you had you had part of your
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
addition a new addition put on and then
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago there was all the
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
electrical cable problems or something
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
like that am I remembering that
 
05:09:49.990 --> 05:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
correctly we had to go in and rewire
 
05:09:52.030 --> 05:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
things was that ever we haven't had an
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
addition since uh 20 years right 203
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
2003 was our last Edition so we had then
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
there was repairs to that one was there
 
05:10:03.628 --> 05:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
repairs to that so we yeah we've done
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
I've been there since 2001 we've done
 
05:10:08.548 --> 05:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
several repairs to uh the roof firewalls
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh electricals been upgraded we we've
 
05:10:14.070 --> 05:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
done a lot I I always asked because back
 
05:10:15.868 --> 05:10:15.878 align:start position:0%
then I was still working i' had retired
 
05:10:18.548 --> 05:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
and work work part-time and help build
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
all your Cabinetry and all your woodwork
 
05:10:22.510 --> 05:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
when they remodel that thing so I've
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
always tried to follow up on oh what was
 
05:10:26.548 --> 05:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
that who who was doing all that shoty
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
work in there wasn't me I was only an
 
05:10:29.400 --> 05:10:31.190 align:start position:0%
work in there wasn't me I was only an
apprentice

05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
apprentice
 
05:10:34.510 --> 05:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Boyd thank you Mr
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
chairman very quickly H how many beds
 
05:10:38.670 --> 05:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
right now are at the home how many vets
 
05:10:40.270 --> 05:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
are occupying those beds and how many
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
vacancies and what are there
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
possibilities with some of the work that
 
05:10:47.708 --> 05:10:47.718 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that will be adding
 
05:10:50.110 --> 05:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
more beds to the facility yes so as I
 
05:10:52.510 --> 05:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
said we are uh budgeted for
 
05:10:55.868 --> 05:10:55.878 align:start position:0%
225 um so I have to match the amount of
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
vacancies that I have with nursing
 
05:11:00.030 --> 05:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
positions specifically with how many
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
veterans I can bring in um so we we have
 
05:11:07.868 --> 05:11:07.878 align:start position:0%
aund right now we have 135 veterans 125
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
men and 10 women we have planned uh a
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
few more admissions are already planned
 
05:11:16.510 --> 05:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
and we have about 40 veterans that are
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the process of being uh applying for
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
our services so we know we could get
 
05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
there we could easily fill 175 beds if I
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
had the staff to do that so it's a
 
05:11:30.110 --> 05:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
balancing that I have to do with making
 
05:11:32.110 --> 05:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
sure the quality of care is there we're
 
05:11:34.750 --> 05:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
meeting their needs and right now I have
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
a a nursing vacancy rate of
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
37% with an LNA vacancy licensed nursing
 
05:11:43.030 --> 05:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
assistant of
 
05:11:46.868 --> 05:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
44% and so with those vacancies uh it
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult to go all the way up
 
05:11:51.868 --> 05:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
and we know that we are um not meeting
 
05:11:53.670 --> 05:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
the needs of all the community veterans
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
that could come in which is the hard
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
thing that we balance so when we have
 
05:11:59.230 --> 05:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
Admissions and we look at who's coming
 
05:12:01.548 --> 05:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
in the door next we are always waiting
 
05:12:04.510 --> 05:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
that with a risk so we never do it in a
 
05:12:06.628 --> 05:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
deli style where someone's in line and
 
05:12:08.788 --> 05:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
they're number one or two or three we
 
05:12:10.510 --> 05:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
look at the weight list that's currently
 
05:12:13.230 --> 05:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
there and say who is at home at most
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
risk or where are they that has the most
 
05:12:18.270 --> 05:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
risk and we admit from that from that
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
perspective right now we are in the
 
05:12:23.350 --> 05:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
process of next week um moving some beds
 
05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
around to use utilize our staff in the
 
05:12:28.670 --> 05:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
best way and our plan is to go to 150
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
residents with our current Staffing that
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
we have we feel that we could safely do
 
05:12:34.510 --> 05:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
that with the reorganization of how
 
05:12:36.670 --> 05:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
we're uh housing the different
 
05:12:40.110 --> 05:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods um so our goal is 15 today
 
05:12:42.310 --> 05:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
with that sensus or with that uh vacancy
 
05:12:44.510 --> 05:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
rate but our bigger goal is to hit that
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
225 we need to make sure uh we can get
 
05:12:48.990 --> 05:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
all of those veterans in and I think
 
05:12:52.150 --> 05:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
that 175 is easy I think that the easier
 
05:12:54.030 --> 05:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
part would be to get the additional we
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
have to know we have to let all the
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
veterans in the community know that you
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
can come to us quickly because right now
 
05:13:01.070 --> 05:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
they don't feel like they can come to us
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
quickly if there's a need and then
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
someone's hospitalized they often go to
 
05:13:06.430 --> 05:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
another facility and then come back to
 
05:13:08.590 --> 05:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
us from another facility we'd like to be
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
that quick turnaround you need us we're
 
05:13:12.548 --> 05:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
there we're going to able to serve you
 
05:13:13.708 --> 05:13:13.718 align:start position:0%
but you underline the point that the
 
05:13:15.910 --> 05:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
continuity of care pce is absolutely
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
necessary in order for for the veterans
 
05:13:19.868 --> 05:13:19.878 align:start position:0%
to get the the quality of kid that they
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
need and deserve y absolutely thank you
 
05:13:23.470 --> 05:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
comedon thank you thank you final
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
question representative Brown thank you
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so do you currently use
 
05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
agency Staffing like most of the other
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
counties and you still can't get enough
 
05:13:32.788 --> 05:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
Staffing we are using agency staff you
 
05:13:35.510 --> 05:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
can get more but it costs a lot of money
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
so you have to weigh that is it worth as
 
05:13:41.110 --> 05:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
tax dollars and the state taxpayer money
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
to increase by one or two veterans um
 
05:13:47.230 --> 05:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
and then how reliable is that because
 
05:13:49.590 --> 05:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
they often go to another contract they
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
stay for 13 weeks um and if I sta if I
 
05:13:55.628 --> 05:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
bring in uh the veterans and I don't
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
have the staff to provide the care so
 
05:13:59.670 --> 05:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
again we're always looking at that
 
05:14:02.030 --> 05:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
really we use most of our Staffing
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
temporary staffing contract is Staffing
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
on second shift hardest shift to fill uh
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
because some people are just shift night
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
owls and most people like to work days
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
so it's that second shift that we have
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
the most difficulty and that's where we
 
05:14:17.150 --> 05:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
use the contracts thank you very much
 
05:14:18.750 --> 05:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for your
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
you I'm
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
did some of those some of those some of
 
05:14:35.270 --> 05:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
those facades when you first walk in are
 
05:14:37.830 --> 05:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
one piece it to it took like 12 of us to

I'm going to pinch hint for for Plymouth
state

05:16:39.788 --> 05:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:16:43.390 --> 05:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
so um we'll walk you through some slides
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
I think um cret also has the electronic
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
version um but also obviously we have
 
05:16:52.030 --> 05:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
hard copies for you this
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
afternoon so um in accordance with
 
05:16:56.670 --> 05:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
statute University system submitted a
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
six-year capital budget as has been the
 
05:17:03.628 --> 05:17:03.638 align:start position:0%
case in the past three bium the the
 
05:17:06.310 --> 05:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
legislature adopted a three banian
 
05:17:08.030 --> 05:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
budget for the University system so
 
05:17:13.708 --> 05:17:13.718 align:start position:0%
there were 21 2021 22 23 24 25 if I have
 
05:17:16.270 --> 05:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
that right um we requested that of the
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
governor she decided not to put that in
 
05:17:22.430 --> 05:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
in her budget the 3 by enum request um
 
05:17:25.310 --> 05:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
however we are very um appreciative the
 
05:17:27.310 --> 05:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
governor did include the entire 20
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
million that we requested for fiscal
 
05:17:32.910 --> 05:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
years 26 and 27 and we'll walk you
 
05:17:34.750 --> 05:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
through that um this
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon the um and these $20 million
 
05:17:42.548 --> 05:17:42.558 align:start position:0%
has significant impact obviously on our
 
05:17:44.190 --> 05:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
entire capital budget and I'll talk a
 
05:17:47.270 --> 05:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
little bit about that in a minute so um
 
05:17:50.190 --> 05:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
if you go to slide
 
05:17:52.868 --> 05:17:52.878 align:start position:0%
three you'll see that
 
05:17:55.868 --> 05:17:55.878 align:start position:0%
um there are projects in this capital
 
05:17:57.948 --> 05:17:57.958 align:start position:0%
budget request that are
 
05:18:00.510 --> 05:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
continuations of current capital
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
projects that are that are ongoing
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
primarily hide Hall at
 
05:18:07.948 --> 05:18:07.958 align:start position:0%
Plymouth um we have requested in fiscal
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
Year's 26 27 4 million for Plymouth 4
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
million for Kean and 12 million for
 
05:18:17.110 --> 05:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
UNH but we're seeking to revise that
 
05:18:20.030 --> 05:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
allocation of request because in the
 
05:18:23.750 --> 05:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
last bium the language was so flexible
 
05:18:26.548 --> 05:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
enough that we accelerated Hyde Hall at
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
Plymouth because of its impact and
 
05:18:31.110 --> 05:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
because of its cost so in this current
 
05:18:33.470 --> 05:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
bium there were more State dollars put
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
toward hide than was originally
 
05:18:35.760 --> 05:18:40.310 align:start position:0%
toward hide than was originally
anticipated

05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:42.990 --> 05:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
so on slide four I just want to take a a
 
05:18:45.628 --> 05:18:45.638 align:start position:0%
moment to tell talk a little bit more
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
about the entire Capital program across
 
05:18:49.350 --> 05:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
the university
 
05:18:52.708 --> 05:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
system University system spends about 65
 
05:18:58.030 --> 05:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
to70 million per year on our Capital
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
program um we have 9.2 million grow
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
square feet across all our campuses we
 
05:19:05.948 --> 05:19:05.958 align:start position:0%
have you know basically three little
 
05:19:08.830 --> 05:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
towns or cities that we're running um
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
428 buildings that doesn't include steam
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
lines that we have roads we maintain
 
05:19:17.390 --> 05:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
water facilities energy generation so we
 
05:19:20.310 --> 05:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
have quite a significant Capital
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
operation if you will across Plymouth
 
05:19:24.670 --> 05:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
State Keane State and the University of
 
05:19:24.680 --> 05:19:26.030 align:start position:0%
State Keane State and the University of
New

05:19:26.030 --> 05:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:19:29.470 --> 05:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you'll see in that pie
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
chart and this this comes from our
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
audited financial statements and this is
 
05:19:36.830 --> 05:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
5 years worth of total Capital spend
 
05:19:39.510 --> 05:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
about half of the capital spend that the
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
university system incurs comes from what
 
05:19:44.990 --> 05:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
we call education and general funds so
 
05:19:47.590 --> 05:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
that would be tuition Revenue possibly
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
research revenue we do issue debt we can
 
05:19:54.670 --> 05:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
only issue debt for
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
self-supporting facilities so by that I
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
mean dorms dining Halls student unions
 
05:20:06.350 --> 05:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
Rec calls any academic space we do not
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
have the authority to issue debt for in
 
05:20:12.190 --> 05:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
in statute and so the state has been an
 
05:20:16.110 --> 05:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
incredible partner in helping with that
 
05:20:19.948 --> 05:20:19.958 align:start position:0%
academic space right to for educational
 
05:20:23.868 --> 05:20:23.878 align:start position:0%
purposes Workforce all of that um
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
auxiliary as I mentioned the auxiliary
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
funds are room and board so those fees
 
05:20:32.030 --> 05:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
help fund those facilities and the
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
capital Appropriations again have been
 
05:20:37.270 --> 05:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
15% a meaningful percentage of our
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
overall Capital program over the last
 
05:20:40.000 --> 05:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
overall Capital program over the last
five

05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.110 --> 05:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
years on uh Slide
 
05:20:48.590 --> 05:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
Five again I mentioned the the
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
partnership the university system has
 
05:20:53.230 --> 05:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
enjoyed has been really impactful I
 
05:20:56.190 --> 05:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um we'd like to move
 
05:20:58.750 --> 05:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
some of the allocation between Plymouth
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
and Keane that was in the request that
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
we did a year ago I should mention I
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
probably should have led with this um
 
05:21:08.670 --> 05:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment is declining we have
 
05:21:11.230 --> 05:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
significant headwinds it's a fact in
 
05:21:13.230 --> 05:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
higher ed especially in New England but
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
in many parts of the country so we are
 
05:21:19.030 --> 05:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
undergoing pretty significant plans on
 
05:21:21.230 --> 05:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
evaluating the footprint what does the
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
footprint need to look like a decade
 
05:21:26.590 --> 05:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
from now we've been selling space we've
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
demolished um dorms at Keen we H are
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
exiting least space we so we are in the
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
process of evaluating the facil how
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
we're sharing space we have um the River
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
Valley Community College is occupying
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
space at Keen State College the system
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
my system office University system
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
office is moving to the nhti campus in a
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
few months so we're really trying to
 
05:21:54.548 --> 05:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
think about space in the future we won't
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
need all this space and how will the
 
05:22:00.910 --> 05:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
space look like that we will have and so
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
when we put this capital budget together
 
05:22:04.030 --> 05:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
a year
 
05:22:07.310 --> 05:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
ago the the totals doesn't change but
 
05:22:10.948 --> 05:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
we'd like to allocate more to Kean less
 
05:22:12.948 --> 05:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
to Plymouth because we spent more on
 
05:22:16.670 --> 05:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
Plymouth in this bium to accelerate that
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
hide Hall project because of the impact
 
05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
frankly it's going to have on the Lakes
 
05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
Region and the North
 
05:22:26.670 --> 05:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
Country so what I'd like to do now Adam
 
05:22:27.990 --> 05:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
and Natalie are going to walk through
 
05:22:30.590 --> 05:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
some of the details of the projects that
 
05:22:33.190 --> 05:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
um at UNH and keen and I'll talk about
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
the hide Hall project unless there are
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions before they get into any any
 
05:22:37.440 --> 05:22:39.030 align:start position:0%
questions before they get into any any
other

05:22:39.030 --> 05:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:22:39.040 --> 05:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
other
um

05:22:40.390 --> 05:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:42.750 --> 05:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
material I just have one question so you
 
05:22:44.910 --> 05:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
were talking you've got four million
 
05:22:48.868 --> 05:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
each for uh hiy Hall and four for Keem
 
05:22:51.470 --> 05:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
State Elliot Center so out of that 8
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
million you just want to reallocate that
 
05:22:55.470 --> 05:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
back and forth correct do do you have
 
05:22:57.750 --> 05:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
any numbers in mind yes if you go if
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
you're on on um slide three yeah if you
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
go to the column The Columns just to the
 
05:23:08.670 --> 05:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
um right of the governor's recommended
 
05:23:11.708 --> 05:23:11.718 align:start position:0%
and I've included usnh at revised oh
 
05:23:15.270 --> 05:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay so it'd be a million at hide and
 
05:23:16.628 --> 05:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
actually and Natalie's going to talk
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
about this in a minute we're not even
 
05:23:21.628 --> 05:23:21.638 align:start position:0%
going to do Elliott we're going to put
 
05:23:23.788 --> 05:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
Elliot aside even though there's
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
significant um deferred maintenance we
 
05:23:28.470 --> 05:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
think those dollars could be better
 
05:23:31.708 --> 05:23:31.718 align:start position:0%
spent at Morrison Redfern and Ketty and
 
05:23:34.350 --> 05:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
there's M again a little more material
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
in in the deck so that's where we'd like
 
05:23:40.830 --> 05:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay um move
 
05:23:48.628 --> 05:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
to okay thank you proceed okay there you
 
05:23:51.030 --> 05:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
go good afternoon chairman Mills and
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um it's my uh
 
05:23:54.430 --> 05:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here with you today to
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
tell you a little bit about our Morse
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
Hall renovation uh Morse Hall is home to
 
05:24:02.990 --> 05:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
the Institute of the um study of Earth
 
05:24:06.150 --> 05:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
oceans and space commonly known as EOS
 
05:24:08.590 --> 05:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
we love our acronyms and that's one gets
 
05:24:11.470 --> 05:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
thrown around a lot so Morse Hall was
 
05:24:14.270 --> 05:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
constructed in 1986 it's named after
 
05:24:17.070 --> 05:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
Richard A Morse class of 1951 and a
 
05:24:19.788 --> 05:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
long-standing member of the um usnh
 
05:24:20.830 --> 05:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
05:24:22.990 --> 05:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
Trustees it's really a Cornerstone
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
building on the UNH campus kind of quite
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
literally sits on a on a corner street
 
05:24:30.830 --> 05:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
um it's a significant building in four
 
05:24:33.590 --> 05:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
stories 130,000 Square ft of overall
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
space if you haven't been there one of
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
the uh notable things about Morse Hall
 
05:24:40.628 --> 05:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
is the atrium that runs right through
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
the core of the building has skylights
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
that let Natural Light Flow down through
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
and and um certainly a unique space on
 
05:24:52.030 --> 05:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
campus so Morse Hall is primarily a
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
research and teaching lab building along
 
05:24:58.590 --> 05:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
with faculty support support
 
05:25:01.548 --> 05:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
space and in uh researching to prepare
 
05:25:03.390 --> 05:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
today I found that the teaching mission
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
of EOS um resonated with me and I wanted
 
05:25:09.390 --> 05:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
to tell you read that that to you so the
 
05:25:11.150 --> 05:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
the mission of EOS is to educate
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
outstanding students capable of
 
05:25:16.030 --> 05:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
advancing our understanding of the earth
 
05:25:18.548 --> 05:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
and its setting in the universe I just
 
05:25:21.430 --> 05:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
thought that was kind of a nice uh nice
 
05:25:23.990 --> 05:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
statement um so
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
the our project at Morse Hall consists
 
05:25:29.788 --> 05:25:29.798 align:start position:0%
primarily of a of a building wide HVAC
 
05:25:32.510 --> 05:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
replacement project as I mentioned the
 
05:25:35.030 --> 05:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
building was constructed in 1986 and all
 
05:25:37.190 --> 05:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
the mechanical systems are original to
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
the building ofth than you know minor ad
 
05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
hoc uh modifications and repairs over
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
the years so it's a complete replacement
 
05:25:46.190 --> 05:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
of the air
 
05:25:49.830 --> 05:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
systems um includes modernizing the Fume
 
05:25:51.670 --> 05:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
hoods which are necessary for safety but
 
05:25:54.150 --> 05:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
also to manage energy use as you can see
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
on a little infographic we included mors
 
05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
Hall has 19 Fume hoods and each one of
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
those hoods uh consumes annually about
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
the same amount of energy as a as a
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
typical home so they consume a lot of
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
energy but are are required for research
 
05:26:14.150 --> 05:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
and for safety of our our faculty and
 
05:26:17.230 --> 05:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
staff um as part of the project not only
 
05:26:18.910 --> 05:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
are we replacing Mechanicals but we're
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
also uh making repairs and improvements
 
05:26:23.670 --> 05:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
to the thermal envelope uh including
 
05:26:25.948 --> 05:26:25.958 align:start position:0%
sealing up the windows and reducing the
 
05:26:34.750 --> 05:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.788 --> 05:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
space um so as I mentioned the the
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
systems are closing in on 40 years old
 
05:26:42.510 --> 05:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
the the picture that we included you
 
05:26:44.270 --> 05:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
know shows that they're not in great
 
05:26:46.190 --> 05:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
shape but almost doesn't do it justice
 
05:26:48.548 --> 05:26:48.558 align:start position:0%
really we're at the end of useful life
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
so one of the things about EOS and the
 
05:26:53.030 --> 05:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
type of research that they do is that it
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
requires really um tight tolerances for
 
05:26:57.628 --> 05:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
space temperature and humidity in the
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
space and the mechanical systems really
 
05:27:03.030 --> 05:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know are past past being usable for
 
05:27:05.110 --> 05:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
even maintaining basic you know Heating
 
05:27:07.270 --> 05:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
and Cooling comfort and just not up to
 
05:27:08.990 --> 05:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
the task for for maintaining the
 
05:27:10.830 --> 05:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
humidity and temperature tolerances that
 
05:27:12.750 --> 05:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
we need in mors Hall which are a
 
05:27:14.590 --> 05:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
requirement of the grants that the
 
05:27:18.310 --> 05:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
researchers there um
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
procure um and then as I mentioned the
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh infiltration just exacerbates that
 
05:27:24.830 --> 05:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
because when we have leakage coming
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
through the windows it makes it that
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
much harder to manage the the humidity
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
temperature so moving on to the funding
 
05:27:38.590 --> 05:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
picture um we're projecting uh uh
 
05:27:41.868 --> 05:27:41.878 align:start position:0%
overall project cost of 22.5 to $24.9
 
05:27:44.510 --> 05:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
million currently uh a little bit of a
 
05:27:47.788 --> 05:27:47.798 align:start position:0%
range as we continue to wrap up uh the
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh construction uh documents
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and we are projecting funding that
 
05:27:58.190 --> 05:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
with 1.5 to $3.9 million in usnh gifts
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
and funds and then have two uh State
 
05:28:03.548 --> 05:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
funding requests one for the current
 
05:28:06.350 --> 05:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
banm and one projected for uh the
 
05:28:06.360 --> 05:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
banm and one projected for uh the
subsequent

05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I talked a lot about EOS because they
 
05:28:13.548 --> 05:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
are the main occupant of the Morse hall
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
building um really notable on the UNH
 
05:28:18.390 --> 05:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
campus in that they're currently
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for 40 to 50% of the overall
 
05:28:23.230 --> 05:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
research dollars coming into the
 
05:28:25.548 --> 05:28:25.558 align:start position:0%
university that's an annual average of
 
05:28:28.230 --> 05:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
about $60 million but in recent years
 
05:28:29.910 --> 05:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
through some really significant grants
 
05:28:32.670 --> 05:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's gone as high as a $100 million in
 
05:28:32.680 --> 05:28:34.150 align:start position:0%
that's gone as high as a $100 million in
FY

05:28:34.150 --> 05:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
FY
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
23 nearly every member of the research
 
05:28:40.830 --> 05:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
faculty in mors Hall is funded through
 
05:28:44.390 --> 05:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
grants and they secure over 100 grants
 
05:28:48.510 --> 05:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:51.708 --> 05:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
basis with
 
05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
that any I'll move into Plymouth unless
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
anyone has questions I'm sorry we do
 
05:28:58.510 --> 05:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
have questions representative
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:29:02.788 --> 05:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question I appreciate it and I
 
05:29:04.750 --> 05:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
apologize I I missed your
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
name your name my name is Kathy
 
05:29:11.070 --> 05:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
preventure thank you oh geez I apologize
 
05:29:13.750 --> 05:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
my neighbor no no need to apologize I
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
apologize I apologize m m Miss
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
preventure alluded to the fact that
 
05:29:21.390 --> 05:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining abilities facilities
 
05:29:23.670 --> 05:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
have the ability to bond themselves I
 
05:29:28.270 --> 05:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
also know that UNH has been um alumni
 
05:29:29.470 --> 05:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
have been very grateful with their
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
donations to the university so like my
 
05:29:34.628 --> 05:29:34.638 align:start position:0%
question is is what's to prevent the
 
05:29:36.990 --> 05:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
University from using some of their
 
05:29:38.470 --> 05:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
endowment money or using using some of
 
05:29:41.548 --> 05:29:41.558 align:start position:0%
their bonding money to uh to subsidize a
 
05:29:44.590 --> 05:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
project as as uh as intensive as
 
05:29:44.600 --> 05:29:46.150 align:start position:0%
project as as uh as intensive as
repairing

05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
repairing
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
morsa so thank you for the question
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative um the university has
 
05:29:54.150 --> 05:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
used actually bonding money and gift
 
05:29:58.270 --> 05:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
money on other recent projects so um
 
05:29:58.280 --> 05:29:59.350 align:start position:0%
money on other recent projects so um
hetel

05:29:59.350 --> 05:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
hetel
 
05:30:02.230 --> 05:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
Hall uh we issued debt for that that's a
 
05:30:04.830 --> 05:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
residence hall that had been shuttered
 
05:30:07.788 --> 05:30:07.798 align:start position:0%
and um we recently changed requirements
 
05:30:09.670 --> 05:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
of freshmen and sophomores live on
 
05:30:11.788 --> 05:30:11.798 align:start position:0%
campus so hetel Hall which is right in
 
05:30:14.830 --> 05:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
the heart of Campus we blonded for that
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
we've also recently received um generous
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
gifts the Hamill Honors College that was
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
funded by um generous ster so that those
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
dollars are there um I I don't believe
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
that Morse would um I don't think we
 
05:30:37.150 --> 05:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
could bond for that because we don't
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
charge a fee see we the our our bonds
 
05:30:43.830 --> 05:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
are backed by the fee Revenue that we
 
05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
charge for a dorm or a dining hall and
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
we don't charge a fee for the use of the
 
05:30:52.230 --> 05:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
academic space we don't we don't issue
 
05:30:54.430 --> 05:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
General obligation bonds like the state
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
does backed by the full faith and credit
 
05:30:58.990 --> 05:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the University system if that makes
 
05:31:01.350 --> 05:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
sense we issue bonds that are only
 
05:31:03.390 --> 05:31:03.400 align:start position:0%
backed by the revenue stream that comes
 
05:31:08.430 --> 05:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
from the fee on those buildings um
 
05:31:11.708 --> 05:31:11.718 align:start position:0%
representative if if we had a generous
 
05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
donor that would fund this project by
 
05:31:21.190 --> 05:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
um no I know I just I appreciate you
 
05:31:26.590 --> 05:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
answering my question um thank you do we
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
want to keep asking questions now or do
 
05:31:29.110 --> 05:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
we want to let them finish their
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
questions individually okay better thank
 
05:31:37.990 --> 05:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
you all right representative Boger yeah
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:31:43.070 --> 05:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my question is on
 
05:31:48.190 --> 05:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
page 10 of your uh you said 40 or 50 40
 
05:31:52.030 --> 05:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
to 50% of all research revenue uh is
 
05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
generated by this one building and grant
 
05:31:58.990 --> 05:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
funding uh equals $100
 
05:32:01.708 --> 05:32:01.718 align:start position:0%
million uh how much of that 100 million
 
05:32:01.718 --> 05:32:03.030 align:start position:0%
million uh how much of that 100 million
is

05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
private grants versus public grants
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:32:11.548 --> 05:32:11.558 align:start position:0%
representative the vast majority of our
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
grants are federal grants I think it's
 
05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
about 75% of our grants are federal
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
grants most are not private follow up
 
05:32:21.430 --> 05:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
please follow
 
05:32:26.510 --> 05:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
up with that being said in uh
 
05:32:30.070 --> 05:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh and in looking at this Revenue
 
05:32:32.590 --> 05:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
Source uh for the building do we
 
05:32:37.230 --> 05:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate that being uh remaining in a
 
05:32:37.240 --> 05:32:38.708 align:start position:0%
anticipate that being uh remaining in a
positive

05:32:38.708 --> 05:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:32:43.470 --> 05:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
manner in the near future
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
in thank you for the question
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of uncertainty
 
05:32:50.990 --> 05:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a lot of uncertainty
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
right now um UNH is one of only I think
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
14 institutions in our country that are
 
05:33:01.670 --> 05:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
land sea and space
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
grants um for for for a university of
 
05:33:08.430 --> 05:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
its size it's
 
05:33:10.750 --> 05:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
actually quite a little Powerhouse in in
 
05:33:13.948 --> 05:33:13.958 align:start position:0%
research it's an R1 which is a the top
 
05:33:16.750 --> 05:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
research classification that said there
 
05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
is real uncertainty about federal grants
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
what is going to flow um and we are
 
05:33:23.628 --> 05:33:23.638 align:start position:0%
monitoring that
 
05:33:27.670 --> 05:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
closely as of the 28th of February we
 
05:33:30.510 --> 05:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
had received notification from the
 
05:33:32.670 --> 05:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
Social Security Administration that
 
05:33:34.350 --> 05:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
there were three grants totaling
 
05:33:36.430 --> 05:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
$700,000 where there would be there was
 
05:33:38.430 --> 05:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
a stop work order so that funding is
 
05:33:42.948 --> 05:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
going to cease um again we
 
05:33:46.390 --> 05:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
are if the grant dollars don't
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
flow there will
 
05:33:50.830 --> 05:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
be a number of people that will be laid
 
05:33:52.510 --> 05:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
off I don't I just there's a lot of
 
05:33:54.670 --> 05:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
uncertainty I don't think that it's
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
going to we don't anticipate that it's
 
05:33:59.150 --> 05:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
going to completely dry up to
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
zero and again this
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
space space maybe that this
 
05:34:09.190 --> 05:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
building is more than half of all the
 
05:34:13.708 --> 05:34:13.718 align:start position:0%
research so I I am we are confident that
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
it will might not continue at the level
 
05:34:18.990 --> 05:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's flowing right now but I remain
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
confident it will continue to to um
 
05:34:25.390 --> 05:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
there will continue to be research
 
05:34:27.548 --> 05:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
done representative
 
05:34:30.030 --> 05:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman so this is
 
05:34:31.390 --> 05:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a two-part question just
 
05:34:33.270 --> 05:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
answered part of it but I want to make
 
05:34:36.150 --> 05:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
sure I'm correct on it so this Morse
 
05:34:38.030 --> 05:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
Building is primarily a re resarch
 
05:34:41.548 --> 05:34:41.558 align:start position:0%
facility it doesn't support degrees oh
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead I was going to say it it it
 
05:34:46.350 --> 05:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
is primarily research but there are
 
05:34:48.430 --> 05:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
there is classroom space and it does
 
05:34:50.548 --> 05:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
support a lot of um there's a lot of
 
05:34:52.990 --> 05:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
student participation in the building um
 
05:34:55.628 --> 05:34:55.638 align:start position:0%
so EOS is multidisciplinary it doesn't
 
05:34:58.190 --> 05:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
belong with any one qual uh one college
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
at the
 
05:35:02.110 --> 05:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
University um but I believe that uh the
 
05:35:04.310 --> 05:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
the latest numbers I heard was was that
 
05:35:07.070 --> 05:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
there are um you know over 300 uh
 
05:35:09.830 --> 05:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
undergraduate students who utilize uh
 
05:35:12.628 --> 05:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
Morse Hall on a on an annual basis so
 
05:35:14.230 --> 05:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
along that same line so what type of
 
05:35:16.750 --> 05:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
degrees does this support just
 
05:35:19.230 --> 05:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
curious sure um
 
05:35:19.240 --> 05:35:21.230 align:start position:0%
curious sure um
so

05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:35:26.310 --> 05:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
um the so there is a lot of uh Masters
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
and PhD research that goes on within the
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
umbrella of um EOS so it is a lot
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
related to Ocean engineering um
 
05:35:38.910 --> 05:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
Aerospace and that type of of um you
 
05:35:41.788 --> 05:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
know seps type degrees but then also
 
05:35:43.830 --> 05:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
does with the multidisciplinary crosses
 
05:35:47.788 --> 05:35:47.798 align:start position:0%
over to um KSA our College of um life
 
05:35:50.430 --> 05:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
sciences and agriculture as well okay so
 
05:35:52.350 --> 05:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
just a kind of F this thank you Mr
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
chairman so you're looking to I'm not
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
used to people asking to change use of
 
05:35:59.670 --> 05:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
money when they already Justified the
 
05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
money for something else so my question
 
05:36:04.110 --> 05:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
is is there a breakdown anywhere as to
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
what the changes are and why these
 
05:36:08.590 --> 05:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
changes are a prior for you now as
 
05:36:11.628 --> 05:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
opposed to what you had asked for
 
05:36:13.990 --> 05:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
previously um absolutely thank you
 
05:36:16.350 --> 05:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative um so none of the changes
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
are for
 
05:36:20.830 --> 05:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
Morse and I am ha I'm happy to follow up
 
05:36:22.830 --> 05:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
on a couple things now from listening
 
05:36:24.990 --> 05:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
give you give you more detail on the
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
Hyde Elliot Morrison because remember we
 
05:36:32.670 --> 05:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
put these together over a year ago um
 
05:36:35.390 --> 05:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
and we in higher red are in a rapidly
 
05:36:38.430 --> 05:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
changing environment um Madam Chancellor
 
05:36:40.150 --> 05:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
why don't why don't we hold off on this
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
question then until we cover those two
 
05:36:44.310 --> 05:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
parts I caught that right away that's
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
why I said let's hold off on some of
 
05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
these questions until they have a chance
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and present why they're
 
05:36:52.510 --> 05:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
doing this thanks Mr chairman I'd like
 
05:36:54.750 --> 05:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
to follow up though I want to come back
 
05:36:56.750 --> 05:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
um to the committee with more
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
information on the degrees and
 
05:37:01.590 --> 05:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
programs being being worked on in Morris
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
because I can tell you another while we
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
say you it's primarily research being
 
05:37:08.910 --> 05:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
done in moris the University of New
 
05:37:11.350 --> 05:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Prides itself on embedding
 
05:37:14.830 --> 05:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
even undergrad students in the research
 
05:37:17.910 --> 05:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
so when research is being conducted it's
 
05:37:20.708 --> 05:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
there are students side by side um in
 
05:37:22.590 --> 05:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
that research space so I'd like to get
 
05:37:24.350 --> 05:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
you some more detail on the programs and
 
05:37:26.750 --> 05:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
the degrees that are being worked on
 
05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay repr of jur thank you Mr chairman
 
05:37:33.030 --> 05:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
for the Mechanicals at uh at Morse Hall
 
05:37:35.070 --> 05:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
are they being fueled by the Steam
 
05:37:37.708 --> 05:37:37.718 align:start position:0%
Plant Morse Hall is connected to our
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
district Energy System so it's actually
 
05:37:41.788 --> 05:37:41.798 align:start position:0%
getting um District heating hot water
 
05:37:44.310 --> 05:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
from the plant rather than steam um but
 
05:37:46.150 --> 05:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
it is connected to the overall campus
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
utility networks it also is connected to
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
our district uh chilled water
 
05:37:52.390 --> 05:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and is served by the new
 
05:37:54.030 --> 05:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
thermal energy storage tank that was
 
05:37:55.628 --> 05:37:55.638 align:start position:0%
just constructed on campus so it's
 
05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
really you know it is uh entirely
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
powered uh and heated and cooled from
 
05:38:04.110 --> 05:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
the University uh District systems okay
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and proceed with the rest
 
05:38:09.230 --> 05:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
your presentation please sure thank you
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
and so um Hyde Hall at
 
05:38:15.470 --> 05:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
Plymouth discussion about that project
 
05:38:18.350 --> 05:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
starts on on slide 12 mentioned earlier
 
05:38:21.030 --> 05:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's the um 81,000 growth square feet
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
the most used academic space on the
 
05:38:26.990 --> 05:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State campus um I want to say
 
05:38:29.910 --> 05:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
six or eight years ago um the the
 
05:38:31.470 --> 05:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
president at Plymouth went to what's
 
05:38:34.110 --> 05:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
called a cluster learning model so all
 
05:38:37.548 --> 05:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
majors now are work on projects with
 
05:38:39.788 --> 05:38:39.798 align:start position:0%
other major so interdisciplinary teams
 
05:38:43.548 --> 05:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
are working and so the the hide Hall is
 
05:38:45.868 --> 05:38:45.878 align:start position:0%
the home of the Innovation and
 
05:38:49.468 --> 05:38:49.478 align:start position:0%
Entrepreneurship cluster and those those
 
05:38:52.910 --> 05:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
um students and faculty work hand inand
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
with businesses governments nonprofits
 
05:38:59.150 --> 05:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
in the lakes and North Country region on
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
projects um trying to innovate and help
 
05:39:02.958 --> 05:39:03.788 align:start position:0%
projects um trying to innovate and help
with

05:39:03.788 --> 05:39:03.798 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:39:05.868 --> 05:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship the
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
um this the condition of hide was
 
05:39:11.948 --> 05:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
frankly it was abysmal
 
05:39:13.990 --> 05:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
before the university system was
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to see um State support
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
on that building that the construction
 
05:39:21.708 --> 05:39:21.718 align:start position:0%
on that building has been ongoing I
 
05:39:25.628 --> 05:39:25.638 align:start position:0%
think for six years um and it's almost
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
finished and we actually accelerated
 
05:39:30.868 --> 05:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
construction on that building because we
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
recognized that it will have real impact
 
05:39:36.510 --> 05:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
on the North Country getting students
 
05:39:38.990 --> 05:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
and and connected with businesses and
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
faculty um and so that's why and and I
 
05:39:46.070 --> 05:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
could talk to Chris about this offline
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the last capital budget the way that
 
05:39:51.948 --> 05:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
was worded it provided the university
 
05:39:55.350 --> 05:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
system flexibility so there was a total
 
05:39:57.230 --> 05:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
appropriated and then there was another
 
05:40:00.830 --> 05:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
section that said hidde Hall UNH
 
05:40:06.390 --> 05:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
Spalding Hall Kean Elliott and it didn't
 
05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
put the dollars specific to the project
 
05:40:11.708 --> 05:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
if that makes any sense and so and it
 
05:40:14.910 --> 05:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
gives um and in the in hb25 the same
 
05:40:16.270 --> 05:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
thing it gives our board some
 
05:40:18.030 --> 05:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility on these projects will be
 
05:40:20.590 --> 05:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
done accordance with Board of Trustees
 
05:40:24.390 --> 05:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
policies and so we accelerated that High
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
um project and slow down any work on
 
05:40:32.830 --> 05:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
Elliot at Keen because we continue to
 
05:40:32.840 --> 05:40:34.350 align:start position:0%
Elliot at Keen because we continue to
re-evaluate

05:40:34.350 --> 05:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate
 
05:40:36.708 --> 05:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
um where where we have to put the
 
05:40:39.230 --> 05:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
limited dollar that we have for Capital
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
so you'll see on slide
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
13 we're seeking a million dollars for
 
05:40:48.990 --> 05:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
hide in the upcoming bium 2627 to finish
 
05:40:50.708 --> 05:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
the project
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
off and Natalie will talk about the
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
shift from Elliott to Morrison and
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
frankly most of it at Keen is um life
 
05:41:05.548 --> 05:41:05.558 align:start position:0%
safety deferred maintenance on on
 
05:41:08.270 --> 05:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
buildings that have a lot use on the
 
05:41:10.150 --> 05:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
campus and again we have so many dollars
 
05:41:13.310 --> 05:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
to spend and so we're trying to Pivot as
 
05:41:16.990 --> 05:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
we continue to analyze our footprint and
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
um where we need to to put our dollars
 
05:41:21.468 --> 05:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
as you know the future looks different
 
05:41:35.788 --> 05:41:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:38.868 --> 05:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
today there we go so good afternoon uh
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
chairman Mills and representatives thank
 
05:41:42.150 --> 05:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
you for allowing us to speak this
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon I want to First address the
 
05:41:48.548 --> 05:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
change that we have going on and the way
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
the system has looked at priority
 
05:41:53.708 --> 05:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
projects both on a campus and within our
 
05:41:55.868 --> 05:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
campuses across the system and
 
05:41:57.750 --> 05:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
accelerating hide because it does make
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
sense to finish the project started as
 
05:42:03.070 --> 05:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
we continue to evaluate the rest of our
 
05:42:06.510 --> 05:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
projects on different campuses so for
 
05:42:08.910 --> 05:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
Keen state we've gone through a very
 
05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
very robust review of every space on
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
campus we've gone through a utilization
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
study we've gone through a master
 
05:42:16.750 --> 05:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
planning process and we've gone through
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
a strategic planning process and through
 
05:42:21.270 --> 05:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
that we want to make sure that we're
 
05:42:24.230 --> 05:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
leveraging our assets um appropriately
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
leveraging our funding that we're
 
05:42:28.310 --> 05:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
getting from the state and as we move
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
through that um process we realize it it
 
05:42:34.910 --> 05:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
Elliott was first presented in 2021 but
 
05:42:37.868 --> 05:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
since then as the campus has changed as
 
05:42:40.190 --> 05:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
higher ed has changed and we realized
 
05:42:42.270 --> 05:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
how much it would cost for a building
 
05:42:45.070 --> 05:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
Elliott is 92,000 Square
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
ft we still believe it's a priority
 
05:42:49.270 --> 05:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
project but we weren't able to
 
05:42:51.230 --> 05:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
effectively leverage the funding that we
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
would get from the state to make the um
 
05:42:57.468 --> 05:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate Renovations and improvements
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
and deferred maintenance um changes that
 
05:43:02.910 --> 05:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
we needed with that funding so we looked
 
05:43:05.670 --> 05:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
at other high priority projects and
 
05:43:07.150 --> 05:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
those are the ones were Shifting the
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
funding too and deferring what we need
 
05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
to do on Elliott it's a massive project
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we felt like we would better utilize
 
05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
and leverage the funds from the state
 
05:43:20.230 --> 05:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
the funds that we had from our education
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
and general funds to be able to complete
 
05:43:25.628 --> 05:43:25.638 align:start position:0%
projects that most impact our students
 
05:43:27.430 --> 05:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
and those using our
 
05:43:31.510 --> 05:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
campus so I'll start with that um and
 
05:43:33.390 --> 05:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly take questions afterwards
 
05:43:34.910 --> 05:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
as I get through the
 
05:43:37.590 --> 05:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
presentation red for an art center is
 
05:43:37.600 --> 05:43:38.948 align:start position:0%
presentation red for an art center is
slide

05:43:38.948 --> 05:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
slide
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
16 it's an 81,000 squ ft building that
 
05:43:46.110 --> 05:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
was originally constructed in 1981 it
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
has three section main sections to it it
 
05:43:52.830 --> 05:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
has a main theater of 600 seats alumni
 
05:43:54.310 --> 05:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
Recital Hall of
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
370 and putam arts lecture hall of 100
 
05:43:59.788 --> 05:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
so you can understand the flexibility it
 
05:44:02.590 --> 05:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
is the most equipped venue in the madn
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
region our corner of the state there um
 
05:44:08.110 --> 05:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
this does provide
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
um both uh uh it's a home for our
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
theater and dance Department our music
 
05:44:16.708 --> 05:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
department our all Steinway program that
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
um we recently commit completed and it's
 
05:44:22.510 --> 05:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
academic and community so bringing those
 
05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
two together as we are a big part of the
 
05:44:26.788 --> 05:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
of the madok region and the Keen
 
05:44:30.030 --> 05:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
Community but first and foremost is
 
05:44:31.948 --> 05:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
supporting those students um getting
 
05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
degrees in those areas as well as other
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
students taking classes and
 
05:44:38.590 --> 05:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
participating in those programs
 
05:44:41.270 --> 05:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
um we've committed our own funds at the
 
05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
same time that we're requesting funds
 
05:44:46.310 --> 05:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
from the state um recently we've done
 
05:44:47.948 --> 05:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
all of the life safety deferred
 
05:44:50.110 --> 05:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance of over $5 million to
 
05:44:52.510 --> 05:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
upgrade that building envelope signage
 
05:44:55.390 --> 05:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
improvements um fire systems and so
 
05:44:58.230 --> 05:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
forth um you can see the list of items
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
that we've we've already done so we're
 
05:45:02.670 --> 05:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
asking for respectfully asking for
 
05:45:04.990 --> 05:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
another million dollars to continue
 
05:45:07.110 --> 05:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
investing in it this year we're
 
05:45:09.788 --> 05:45:09.798 align:start position:0%
investing out of our own funds
 
05:45:12.788 --> 05:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
$800,000 um to comp to replace the
 
05:45:15.990 --> 05:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
failed HVAC unit um and what we're
 
05:45:19.750 --> 05:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
asking for are um and we've continued to
 
05:45:21.788 --> 05:45:21.798 align:start position:0%
do some roofing repair we need another
 
05:45:23.948 --> 05:45:23.958 align:start position:0%
700,000 for roofing that needs
 
05:45:26.910 --> 05:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
replacement and 300,000 for replacement
 
05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
of those failed original wood windows
 
05:45:32.030 --> 05:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
which would give us better Energy
 
05:45:34.390 --> 05:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
Efficiency but also failing Windows
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
where we have a failed HV AC system are
 
05:45:41.708 --> 05:45:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:44.230 --> 05:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
us that's a million dooll investment if
 
05:45:46.868 --> 05:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
we look at slide
 
05:45:49.468 --> 05:45:49.478 align:start position:0%
17 I'll move on to Morrison Hall which
 
05:45:52.468 --> 05:45:52.478 align:start position:0%
is our primary investment Morrison Hall
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
is one of our primary if not the primary
 
05:45:56.830 --> 05:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
academic building two floors of
 
05:45:59.868 --> 05:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
classrooms some faculty office and the
 
05:46:01.430 --> 05:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
majors that we're talking about are
 
05:46:04.110 --> 05:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
history modern languages psychology
 
05:46:06.430 --> 05:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
journalism um and other arts and
 
05:46:08.548 --> 05:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
humanities those are just the majors
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
because keeping in mind that students
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
that aren't Majors that are in our stem
 
05:46:14.910 --> 05:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
programs still take those liberal arts
 
05:46:17.628 --> 05:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
classes so really touches just about
 
05:46:20.350 --> 05:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
every student on campus uses that
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
building it was named after Henry
 
05:46:26.390 --> 05:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
Morrison and he was a key figure in the
 
05:46:29.310 --> 05:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
founding of keen normal school back in
 
05:46:33.270 --> 05:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
1909 um the building was constructed in
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
1961 we've done what we can to focus on
 
05:46:38.990 --> 05:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
key deferred maintenance over the years
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
but certainly nothing substantive has
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
been done which is why you know we've
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
done um some updates LED fixtures take
 
05:46:49.190 --> 05:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of some energy efficiencies uh
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
section of the roof new fire panel that
 
05:46:53.190 --> 05:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
was required for Life Safety but right
 
05:46:55.190 --> 05:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
now A fullscale renovation is needed for
 
05:46:57.910 --> 05:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
our students current and future to be
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
able to use this space so um we're
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
asking for $5
 
05:47:06.430 --> 05:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
million this is life safety Ada and
 
05:47:07.868 --> 05:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
critical deferred
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
maintenance our bathrooms are not ADA
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
Compliant they are completely outdated
 
05:47:17.430 --> 05:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a central HVAC system
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
which provides challenges in in the
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
learning environment for our students um
 
05:47:25.910 --> 05:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
an entrance Portico is deteriorating to
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
the point where it's not safe and will
 
05:47:31.868 --> 05:47:31.878 align:start position:0%
continue to be even more unsafe unless
 
05:47:34.830 --> 05:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
we address that as well as Tower the
 
05:47:36.628 --> 05:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
stairs and the hallway tile flooring
 
05:47:40.030 --> 05:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
that's popping up so
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
um all of that with deferred maintenance
 
05:47:46.110 --> 05:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
being eliminated as part of the
 
05:47:49.548 --> 05:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
renovation um totals $5
 
05:47:54.070 --> 05:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
million our last space that we
 
05:47:58.270 --> 05:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
would respectfully request funding
 
05:48:01.230 --> 05:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
for is for our Ketty house it's a stick
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
frame building a wood frame excuse me uh
 
05:48:07.948 --> 05:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
we've done some minor r to that and
 
05:48:10.628 --> 05:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
right now it primarily um our campus
 
05:48:14.230 --> 05:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
safety uh office uses most of the space
 
05:48:16.030 --> 05:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
we also have a second floor where we
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
have some office space for faculty in
 
05:48:23.350 --> 05:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
our nursing and dietetic um Majors um
 
05:48:25.350 --> 05:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
this is uh critical life safety
 
05:48:27.270 --> 05:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
requirements and deferred maintenance
 
05:48:30.590 --> 05:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
related to the slate roof and windows
 
05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
we've just recently had a life safety
 
05:48:35.350 --> 05:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
review by our State Fire Marshall and
 
05:48:37.590 --> 05:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
this is in direct response to those
 
05:48:40.150 --> 05:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
items that were noted as um clear
 
05:48:42.190 --> 05:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
improvements that needed to be made for
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
it to be used as we um as we use it
 
05:48:49.830 --> 05:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
today um all of the exterior windows
 
05:48:52.070 --> 05:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
need replacement framing sheet rock
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
slate roof and sprinkler work utility
 
05:48:57.548 --> 05:48:57.558 align:start position:0%
relocation and sheetrock
 
05:48:59.750 --> 05:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
replacement those are the um
 
05:49:01.510 --> 05:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
improvements that would go towards the
 
05:49:01.520 --> 05:49:03.868 align:start position:0%
improvements that would go towards the
$1

05:49:03.868 --> 05:49:03.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:06.830 --> 05:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
million I believe that uh wraps up the
 
05:49:08.510 --> 05:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
presentation for Keen State I'd welcome
 
05:49:11.190 --> 05:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative Brown
 
05:49:19.270 --> 05:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
has your previous question been suitably
 
05:49:23.350 --> 05:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
answered how it goes how how they go
 
05:49:26.350 --> 05:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
around representative
 
05:49:29.670 --> 05:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
your testimony I appreciate it my niece
 
05:49:35.310 --> 05:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
just graduated from there
 
05:49:38.590 --> 05:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you appreciate it she um she's
 
05:49:41.910 --> 05:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
a very happy owl I will say that very
 
05:49:44.468 --> 05:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
happy absolutely is she working in New
 
05:49:49.070 --> 05:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh my niece is currently back
 
05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
home in Danvers Massachusetts with my
 
05:49:53.990 --> 05:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
sister and brother-in-law and she is
 
05:49:56.708 --> 05:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
working two jobs but predominantly she
 
05:49:59.270 --> 05:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
is back working for the town of Danvers
 
05:50:02.788 --> 05:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh her Focus was on psychology and a
 
05:50:04.390 --> 05:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
specific minor that I'm drawing a blank
 
05:50:06.430 --> 05:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
on but she's working in there after
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
after Care Program kids get out of
 
05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
school they go there um until their
 
05:50:13.230 --> 05:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
parents get out of work and pick them up
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
so she's trying to figure out what the
 
05:50:17.390 --> 05:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
what the next steps are going to be so
 
05:50:19.430 --> 05:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh I I appreciate the interest but she
 
05:50:22.230 --> 05:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
had an amazing four years and um she's
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
got a guy friend and several good
 
05:50:28.350 --> 05:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
girlfriends and um she she she bemon
 
05:50:30.628 --> 05:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
missing chak cuder night every Thursday
 
05:50:34.070 --> 05:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
so so I think that's a good thing so uh
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions um you alluded
 
05:50:38.708 --> 05:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
to in your testimony that you're
 
05:50:41.310 --> 05:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
pivoting from Elliot to go to Redfern
 
05:50:44.270 --> 05:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
and and Cy what remains to be done at
 
05:50:46.190 --> 05:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
Elliot and what's the what's the price
 
05:50:47.350 --> 05:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
tag on
 
05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
that Elliot would be about a $20 million
 
05:50:53.030 --> 05:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
price tag if you'll recall the history
 
05:50:54.670 --> 05:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
behind Elliott and and I should have
 
05:50:57.070 --> 05:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
started out with that Elliott the main
 
05:50:59.150 --> 05:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
historical building was the old Elliott
 
05:51:02.230 --> 05:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
hospital for Keen um if anybody can we
 
05:51:03.868 --> 05:51:03.878 align:start position:0%
actually have people on campus that were
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
born at Elliott hospital so it's an so
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
we do have um Elliot the main section is
 
05:51:12.030 --> 05:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
the historical mansion and then there
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
have been add-ons they have added on and
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
added on and added on the space is um
 
05:51:23.030 --> 05:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
not conducive to all of the student
 
05:51:26.948 --> 05:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
services that we have in there um the
 
05:51:29.070 --> 05:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
the same reasons we originally asked for
 
05:51:31.868 --> 05:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
it still stand with the Departments that
 
05:51:34.750 --> 05:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
are in Elliott the admissions student
 
05:51:37.468 --> 05:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
advisory services financial aid student
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
accounts um our Counseling Center all of
 
05:51:44.310 --> 05:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
that is still in Elliott it's just that
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
the money we have available to us in our
 
05:51:50.190 --> 05:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
unrestricted funds are not sufficient
 
05:51:53.070 --> 05:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
along with the state funding to make the
 
05:51:55.270 --> 05:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
kind of impact we would need right now
 
05:51:57.230 --> 05:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
we're just asking for a couple more
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
years before we can come back with
 
05:52:03.030 --> 05:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully more funding that we have
 
05:52:05.070 --> 05:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
available along with State funding to be
 
05:52:07.910 --> 05:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
able to do that but with the amount of
 
05:52:10.030 --> 05:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
funding that we're asking for we think
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
there will be a bigger impact on our
 
05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
students in our campus by um pivoting to
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
what we've seen from our utilization and
 
05:52:19.310 --> 05:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
master planning pivoting to what we can
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
actually complete with that funding with
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
Morrison kedy um uh and uh Redfern
 
05:52:29.708 --> 05:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
follow follow up thank you thank you for
 
05:52:31.910 --> 05:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
the question I appreciate the followup
 
05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh pivoting to the $800,000 investment
 
05:52:38.150 --> 05:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:52:40.750 --> 05:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
HVAC yes I'm I'm happy that you have
 
05:52:43.430 --> 05:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
skin in the game I just my question is
 
05:52:45.430 --> 05:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
um what what revenues are you pulling
 
05:52:49.070 --> 05:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
from to to to pay for that unit is it a
 
05:52:53.510 --> 05:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
combination of of gift um no that one is
 
05:52:56.788 --> 05:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
out of our um unrestricted funds or e e
 
05:52:59.468 --> 05:52:59.478 align:start position:0%
education in general coming from normal
 
05:53:02.390 --> 05:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
tuition and other Revenue Kathy did
 
05:53:04.670 --> 05:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
you I don't know if this is helpful at
 
05:53:07.390 --> 05:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
all when I when I mentioned the capital
 
05:53:09.990 --> 05:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
budget annually of the University system
 
05:53:13.310 --> 05:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
the way our capital budget is built is
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
we target one times depreciation right
 
05:53:21.310 --> 05:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
so we have G uh financial statements on
 
05:53:23.708 --> 05:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
based on generally accepted accounting
 
05:53:26.510 --> 05:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
principles and depreciation is an
 
05:53:30.548 --> 05:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
expense a non-cash expense but the whole
 
05:53:32.750 --> 05:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
theory behind depreciation is you're
 
05:53:36.230 --> 05:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to plow it back into your Capital
 
05:53:38.910 --> 05:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
so so we target one times depreciation
 
05:53:40.948 --> 05:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
so when you ask about the
 
05:53:44.030 --> 05:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
800,000 that would be funded from Keen
 
05:53:46.310 --> 05:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
one time depreciation when it's putting
 
05:53:48.430 --> 05:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
its capital budget together that's
 
05:53:49.868 --> 05:53:49.878 align:start position:0%
approved each year by our Board of
 
05:53:52.030 --> 05:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
Trustees if that's helpful no that makes
 
05:53:53.868 --> 05:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
sense and I get that I get that follow
 
05:53:57.548 --> 05:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:01.708 --> 05:54:01.718 align:start position:0%
you as it relates to Morrison Hall only
 
05:54:05.070 --> 05:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
because I have a as as Miss preventure
 
05:54:07.230 --> 05:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
can relate to to the challenge that we
 
05:54:09.110 --> 05:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
have regarding a school administrative
 
05:54:12.030 --> 05:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
unit in in our community how long has
 
05:54:14.788 --> 05:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
Morrison Hall been non-ada compliant is
 
05:54:19.510 --> 05:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:24.070 --> 05:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
exposure they are non ADA Compliant if
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
we in order for us to do any Renovations
 
05:54:30.270 --> 05:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
or any deferred maintenance work we have
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
to address the Ada needs so when we
 
05:54:35.310 --> 05:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
built the building nothing's changed
 
05:54:37.190 --> 05:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
saying we're out of compliance because
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
we built according to the laws and
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
regulations in place at that time once
 
05:54:44.788 --> 05:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
we start doing any of this type of
 
05:54:47.788 --> 05:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
renovation work and deferred maintenance
 
05:54:49.670 --> 05:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
then we have to adhere to the ADA
 
05:54:52.468 --> 05:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
requirements okay um and it's the it's
 
05:54:54.708 --> 05:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do as we're
 
05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
continuing through addressing the
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
Deferred maintenance and Renovations no
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
I agree with you I agree with you on
 
05:55:00.670 --> 05:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
that and one one last question Mr
 
05:55:02.910 --> 05:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
chairman one last question thank you I
 
05:55:07.270 --> 05:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:17.548 --> 05:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm going to withdraw my
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman thank you we'll
 
05:55:21.510 --> 05:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
we'll see if we come back to you
 
05:55:23.750 --> 05:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative jurus thank you Mr
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
chairman for the for the HVAC
 
05:55:28.590 --> 05:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
improvements have you considered um on
 
05:55:31.190 --> 05:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
these two halls have you considered uh
 
05:55:33.750 --> 05:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
heat pumps at all and and for the
 
05:55:34.788 --> 05:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
roofing have you considered
 
05:55:34.798 --> 05:55:37.150 align:start position:0%
roofing have you considered
photovoltaics

05:55:37.150 --> 05:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
photovoltaics
 
05:55:40.270 --> 05:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry portable heat pumps for the
 
05:55:44.310 --> 05:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh the H system a a steam you have Steam
 
05:55:46.350 --> 05:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
Plant okay that we use throughout our
 
05:55:51.230 --> 05:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
campus um so really the HVAC is just um
 
05:55:54.230 --> 05:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
air circulation and thank you and that
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
sure representative Brown thank you Mr
 
05:55:59.948 --> 05:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
chairman so when you were talking about
 
05:56:02.708 --> 05:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
the Elliott my concern was you're you're
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
putting the money to good use now in the
 
05:56:06.910 --> 05:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
existing buildings I'm s Safi what you
 
05:56:08.510 --> 05:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
were saying that but then as you were
 
05:56:10.990 --> 05:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the LA my concern is just
 
05:56:12.548 --> 05:56:12.558 align:start position:0%
like a lot of the budgets that we're
 
05:56:15.030 --> 05:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
reviewing you're deferring and now
 
05:56:16.990 --> 05:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying when you do the repairs
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's going to be $20 million that's a
 
05:56:20.430 --> 05:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
pretty big chunk of change and then I'm
 
05:56:22.390 --> 05:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that because we're deferring
 
05:56:24.708 --> 05:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
this that this facility uh will
 
05:56:27.390 --> 05:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
deteriorate further as opposed to maybe
 
05:56:29.628 --> 05:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
spending some money more wisely now to
 
05:56:30.990 --> 05:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
take harison listening I just want to
 
05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's addressed in your
 
05:56:35.868 --> 05:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
future plans thank you C certainly if I
 
05:56:38.510 --> 05:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
may answer um and thank you for that
 
05:56:41.270 --> 05:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
question because we continue and we have
 
05:56:43.390 --> 05:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
a very good track record of making sure
 
05:56:45.310 --> 05:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
that we take care of those critical
 
05:56:47.430 --> 05:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance needs although they
 
05:56:52.430 --> 05:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
may be peac meal so we do have some um
 
05:56:54.670 --> 05:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
Elliot improvements and deferred
 
05:56:56.910 --> 05:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance being done it's just that we
 
05:56:59.070 --> 05:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the funding to do everything
 
05:57:02.310 --> 05:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
at once within the banum so we won't
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
spend 20 million on it now but that
 
05:57:05.868 --> 05:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
price change has only changed because of
 
05:57:08.868 --> 05:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
cost increases not because of additional
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance or the the
 
05:57:13.590 --> 05:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
significant portion of what's that price
 
05:57:16.150 --> 05:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
tag is not the price increases or
 
05:57:17.548 --> 05:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
additional deferred maintenance each
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
year it's just about the same because we
 
05:57:21.070 --> 05:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
continue to try and keep up with it
 
05:57:23.390 --> 05:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
peace meal and that goes throughout
 
05:57:25.750 --> 05:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
campus thank you representative Jack do
 
05:57:26.708 --> 05:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
you have do you have anything
 
05:57:26.718 --> 05:57:28.110 align:start position:0%
you have do you have anything
representative

05:57:28.110 --> 05:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:32.350 --> 05:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
Jack the the prior six-year plan is now
 
05:57:34.110 --> 05:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
fully executed there's nothing there's
 
05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
no funds going in between these
 
05:57:39.910 --> 05:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
BS that's correct representative thank
 
05:57:42.110 --> 05:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
you for your question the the six-year
 
05:57:45.190 --> 05:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
banial plan is spent we have some
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
probably some small things to spend left
 
05:57:48.830 --> 05:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
well from now until the end of the year
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
on Hyde um it does remind me though um
 
05:57:56.628 --> 05:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
the Spalding Life Sciences Center at the
 
05:58:00.548 --> 05:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire $95 million
 
05:58:03.390 --> 05:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
project really brings the
 
05:58:06.270 --> 05:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
university um into a different place
 
05:58:08.830 --> 05:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
with life sciences and New Hampshire
 
05:58:10.948 --> 05:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
Life Sciences has been identified by the
 
05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
B business and economic Affairs
 
05:58:15.670 --> 05:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
Department as one of the fastest growing
 
05:58:19.150 --> 05:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
areas so really I think big impact for
 
05:58:22.430 --> 05:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
our state and our Workforce um because
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
the state that was a $95 million project
 
05:58:29.670 --> 05:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
the state partnered for $35 million over
 
05:58:32.270 --> 05:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
the past six years so significant amount
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the university invested 60 million
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
there will be a grand opening in June I
 
05:58:39.628 --> 05:58:39.638 align:start position:0%
I would love to send the committee if
 
05:58:41.548 --> 05:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
you're interested and available if you
 
05:58:44.548 --> 05:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
have any interest in in seeing um a
 
05:58:46.430 --> 05:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
project that the state really had huge
 
05:58:48.390 --> 05:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
impact on that I think will drive
 
05:58:50.468 --> 05:58:50.478 align:start position:0%
Workforce we we'd be happy to come to a
 
05:58:53.750 --> 05:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
$35 million party terrific well I'm not
 
05:58:56.750 --> 05:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
saying the part's going to be it'll 35
 
05:58:58.230 --> 05:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
million there'll be a party if we show
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
up and and Hyde Hall at Plymouth the
 
05:59:02.468 --> 05:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
same thing I think that will also
 
05:59:03.910 --> 05:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
there'll be a grand opening there and
 
05:59:06.788 --> 05:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
that the state has invested significant
 
05:59:09.150 --> 05:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
along with the university to to Really
 
05:59:11.548 --> 05:59:11.558 align:start position:0%
Drive some impact for our future so the
 
05:59:13.590 --> 05:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
last question for them is from
 
05:59:17.150 --> 05:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Newman yes um Chancellor
 
05:59:19.510 --> 05:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
you had said at the beginning that
 
05:59:22.868 --> 05:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
enrollment was down at UNH is enrollment
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
down also at Kean and at Plymouth so so
 
05:59:29.310 --> 05:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
enrollment is declining frankly
 
05:59:31.590 --> 05:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment is declining at almost all
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
institutions of Higher Learning unless
 
05:59:36.788 --> 05:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
you're you know maybe Harvard uh because
 
05:59:38.468 --> 05:59:38.478 align:start position:0%
of the demographic headwinds in New
 
05:59:40.110 --> 05:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
England there are just
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
fewer high school graduates and you know
 
05:59:44.670 --> 05:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure from the towns that you
 
05:59:48.070 --> 05:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
live in um and so that enrollment
 
05:59:51.030 --> 05:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
decline puts a lot of competitive
 
05:59:53.830 --> 05:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
pressure on institutions of higher ed in
 
05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
New England there's like one on every
 
05:59:59.310 --> 05:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
street corner here in New England and so
 
06:00:01.868 --> 06:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
again that it's it's going to continue
 
06:00:03.868 --> 06:00:03.878 align:start position:0%
and we're planning for it and it's it's
 
06:00:07.910 --> 06:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
painful we have to reimagine
 
06:00:12.548 --> 06:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
what we're going to look like and um so
 
06:00:15.190 --> 06:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
enrollment has been declining across the
 
06:00:18.150 --> 06:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
university system some campuses have a
 
06:00:20.670 --> 06:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
you know bigger like UNH was flat this
 
06:00:24.670 --> 06:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
year Plymouth was down this year so but
 
06:00:26.910 --> 06:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
overall if you look over the past five
 
06:00:30.030 --> 06:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
years enrollments declined about 11%
 
06:00:33.468 --> 06:00:33.478 align:start position:0%
undergrad um non-res and res actually
 
06:00:36.910 --> 06:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
tidbit and then I'll let you go um this
 
06:00:40.230 --> 06:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
fall was the first time since
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
2013 we had more New Hampshire students
 
06:00:50.110 --> 06:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
entering us as um as freshmen and um I
 
06:00:52.830 --> 06:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
contribute that in part we've we've the
 
06:00:55.270 --> 06:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
university system has received
 
06:00:57.590 --> 06:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
increasing operating support from the
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
state we've held tuition flat New
 
06:01:01.628 --> 06:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tuition flat for the past six
 
06:01:04.468 --> 06:01:04.478 align:start position:0%
years and and I think that had an impact
 
06:01:06.350 --> 06:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
on and we know our new New Hampshire
 
06:01:07.990 --> 06:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
students are more likely to stay and
 
06:01:11.830 --> 06:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
work here so we we we have to all drive
 
06:01:13.868 --> 06:01:13.878 align:start position:0%
to to keep more of our New Hampshire
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
students here in the state so Chancellor
 
06:01:18.590 --> 06:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
06:01:20.390 --> 06:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you thank you very

last page of your deck so if you have a
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
question that comes up later by all
 
06:01:30.350 --> 06:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
means we're we're always happy to to get
 
06:01:33.510 --> 06:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
answers to your questions thanks so much
 
06:01:42.110 --> 06:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:42.120 --> 06:01:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:01:43.350 --> 06:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:50.190 --> 06:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
more well I mean if you have to go you
 
06:01:53.190 --> 06:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
go then go by just let me know ahead of
 
06:02:19.350 --> 06:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:22.430 --> 06:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:25.270 --> 06:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon welcome to Public Works
 
06:03:28.110 --> 06:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
PE development Port Authority um and
 
06:03:29.910 --> 06:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
we'll do it in your order because I
 
06:03:31.948 --> 06:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
think we can get rid of the first couple
 
06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
of pages rather quick you started with
 
06:03:37.510 --> 06:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
lapse extensions yes and for the record
 
06:03:38.670 --> 06:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
I'm Paul Breen I'm the executive
 
06:03:41.070 --> 06:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
director of Peace Development Authority
 
06:03:42.830 --> 06:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh airport sponsor of Portsmith
 
06:03:44.670 --> 06:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
International Airport Sky Haven airport
 
06:03:46.468 --> 06:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
in Rochester and also have
 
06:03:48.628 --> 06:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
administrative oversight of the P of
 
06:03:51.510 --> 06:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
division of ports and harbors um yes to
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
to be brief uh we do have one lapse item
 
06:03:57.190 --> 06:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
essentially that is a project uh
 
06:03:59.230 --> 06:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
associated with the Turnin Basin
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
dredging of the piscatqua bay um some of
 
06:04:04.030 --> 06:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
you may recall that we dredged that so
 
06:04:06.190 --> 06:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
that large ships could could turn there
 
06:04:08.990 --> 06:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
is one Boulder remaining um Army Corps
 
06:04:12.468 --> 06:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
of Engineers uh they hope to address it
 
06:04:14.230 --> 06:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh potentially through another project
 
06:04:15.948 --> 06:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
at at at division of Porton harbors
 
06:04:17.468 --> 06:04:17.478 align:start position:0%
where they can mobilize the specific
 
06:04:19.390 --> 06:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
equipment needed for that large Boulder
 
06:04:21.350 --> 06:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
removal um so that's the only lapse for
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
you uh we do have three projects that
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
are closing out uh the main paay
 
06:04:26.548 --> 06:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation that's the major
 
06:04:28.150 --> 06:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
restoration over the Market Street deep
 
06:04:30.670 --> 06:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
water birth um we're basically on our
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
button list uh punch list items for that
 
06:04:34.750 --> 06:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
project and we hope to have that
 
06:04:37.310 --> 06:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
completed by one essentially the last
 
06:04:41.830 --> 06:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
part is applying epoxy um uh sail coat
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
on on the decking um the second one is
 
06:04:47.110 --> 06:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
the commercial Portsmouth commercial
 
06:04:51.150 --> 06:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
fish pair uh decking and bracing project
 
06:04:53.468 --> 06:04:53.478 align:start position:0%
this was to restore the wooden Paar that
 
06:04:58.190 --> 06:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
offloads the commercial um uh catch the
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
commercial fish catch and allows the the
 
06:05:02.350 --> 06:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
fishermen to get to their vessels um and
 
06:05:04.750 --> 06:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
we we believe that should be buttoned up
 
06:05:06.350 --> 06:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh early this spring
 
06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
and um very small amount to be paid out
 
06:05:26.130 --> 06:05:26.140 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:26.140 --> 06:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:05:34.500 --> 06:05:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:34.510 --> 06:05:35.948 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:05:35.948 --> 06:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
ready and operational by uh the end of
 
06:05:39.868 --> 06:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
the spring we're trying to meet the
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
needs of the commercial fishing fleet
 
06:05:43.628 --> 06:05:43.638 align:start position:0%
and and get putting a good turn on
 
06:05:46.350 --> 06:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
restoring that building to operation um
 
06:05:49.230 --> 06:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
but essentially we have uh
 
06:05:49.240 --> 06:05:51.070 align:start position:0%
but essentially we have uh
$776,000

06:05:51.070 --> 06:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
$776,000
 
06:05:53.548 --> 06:05:53.558 align:start position:0%
outstanding and uh division of Porton
 
06:05:54.468 --> 06:05:54.478 align:start position:0%
Harbors has
 
06:05:57.468 --> 06:05:57.478 align:start position:0%
$225,000 internally outstanding on that
 
06:05:58.990 --> 06:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
um and as I explained we do have the one
 
06:06:01.468 --> 06:06:01.478 align:start position:0%
lapse item for the boulder
 
06:06:04.510 --> 06:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
removal and finally uh we have three
 
06:06:06.110 --> 06:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
projects before you put in Porton
 
06:06:08.910 --> 06:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
Harbors um the first one wait second
 
06:06:08.920 --> 06:06:10.030 align:start position:0%
Harbors um the first one wait second
sorry

06:06:10.030 --> 06:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:06:12.070 --> 06:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative representative Jack are
 
06:06:14.270 --> 06:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
you good with all the laps extensions
 
06:06:16.070 --> 06:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
then proceed please thank you thank you
 
06:06:18.910 --> 06:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I apologize uh Market Street
 
06:06:21.548 --> 06:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
Marine Terminal main Warf dredging uh 1
 
06:06:24.510 --> 06:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
point just over $1.4 million essentially
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
this request is is to uh dredge along
 
06:06:31.070 --> 06:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
the the Deep birth terminal uh just to
 
06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
give you an idea we currently have
 
06:06:36.110 --> 06:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
sediment and debris uh along the war
 
06:06:37.990 --> 06:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
and this would ultimately allow a
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
contractor to come in and remove that
 
06:06:42.510 --> 06:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
and allow uh larger draft vessels to
 
06:06:45.350 --> 06:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
utilize the port to to to give you an
 
06:06:47.948 --> 06:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
idea currently if we have a a a road
 
06:06:51.030 --> 06:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
salt shipment coming in from from uh
 
06:06:54.030 --> 06:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
Chile uh they may have to stop at a port
 
06:06:56.628 --> 06:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
in New York or or Chelsea Massachusetts
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
to actually offload tonnage um so that
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
they can get their draft a little bit a
 
06:07:03.270 --> 06:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
little bit uh higher because of the the
 
06:07:04.830 --> 06:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
sediment and debris that's along our
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
Warf um so this would Bode very well
 
06:07:09.430 --> 06:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
with the business that we're trying to
 
06:07:12.788 --> 06:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
win with the new new re reinstated uh
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
main Warf and this would just allow us
 
06:07:17.788 --> 06:07:17.798 align:start position:0%
to get uh deeper deeper sh birth ships
 
06:07:21.350 --> 06:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
and more warpage to be offloaded at the
 
06:07:23.590 --> 06:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
facility the second item is the Ry
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
Harbor and hampon harbor rip wrap repair
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
um we've had we're we're what we call at
 
06:07:32.430 --> 06:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
the uh tip of the spear for uh sea level
 
06:07:34.948 --> 06:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
rising um and Ry Harbor and hon Harbor
 
06:07:36.910 --> 06:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
are two facilities that are seeing uh
 
06:07:39.670 --> 06:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
that most directly in 2018 we have
 
06:07:42.310 --> 06:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
significant storm storage that caused a
 
06:07:44.430 --> 06:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of damage at Ry and
 
06:07:49.350 --> 06:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hampton um that was uh we saw additional
 
06:07:52.468 --> 06:07:52.478 align:start position:0%
king tide Storm surges in
 
06:07:55.670 --> 06:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
2023 uh two events that primarily uh
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
created a substantial amount of damage
 
06:08:01.910 --> 06:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
um from the 2018 storm FEMA did come and
 
06:08:04.110 --> 06:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
give us an assessment and gave us uh
 
06:08:06.270 --> 06:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
design plans to actually strengthened
 
06:08:09.750 --> 06:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
the rip wrap um revetment at Ry Harbor
 
06:08:13.910 --> 06:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
and and gave us um ideas and initiatives
 
06:08:16.030 --> 06:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
how to strengthen Hampton Harbor um that
 
06:08:18.030 --> 06:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
valuation in today's number is now at
 
06:08:21.190 --> 06:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
$765,000 um but that would be to
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
directly improve the revetment and rip
 
06:08:26.708 --> 06:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
wrap uh basically the seaw wall at the
 
06:08:30.030 --> 06:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
harbor and and allow us to um support
 
06:08:33.110 --> 06:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining our infrastructure uh as a
 
06:08:36.590 --> 06:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
sustainable initiative uh long term
 
06:08:39.948 --> 06:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
and then finally um this one continues
 
06:08:42.030 --> 06:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
to become more of a priority but we we
 
06:08:43.510 --> 06:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
do think the other two projects are more
 
06:08:45.628 --> 06:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
significant at this time but our Market
 
06:08:48.030 --> 06:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
Street Marine Terminal Warehouse uh also
 
06:08:50.628 --> 06:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
houses the the offices for division and
 
06:08:52.390 --> 06:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
ports and harbors and to give you a
 
06:08:53.590 --> 06:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
little history lesson many of you
 
06:08:56.230 --> 06:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
probably aware but the the the warehouse
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
there it's about a 177,000 foot
 
06:09:01.310 --> 06:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
Warehouse um it was built in the 1970s
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the idea was that New Hampshire
 
06:09:06.350 --> 06:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
liquor sales the liquor would come in uh
 
06:09:10.510 --> 06:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
via vessel and be stored on site um that
 
06:09:13.670 --> 06:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
practice hasn't been in place in decades
 
06:09:15.628 --> 06:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
uh The Liquor Commission has a logistics
 
06:09:17.390 --> 06:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
company that that handles it very
 
06:09:19.708 --> 06:09:19.718 align:start position:0%
efficiently um and there is no liquor
 
06:09:21.670 --> 06:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
stored at the warehouse we have used the
 
06:09:24.230 --> 06:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
warehouse for different OD ad hoc type
 
06:09:26.510 --> 06:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
movements but it's really underutilized
 
06:09:30.150 --> 06:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
and it's in it's in poor uh uh state of
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
state of repair um essentially we
 
06:09:34.910 --> 06:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
actually have a moratorium right now
 
06:09:37.868 --> 06:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
that um if we have a a snow load of of
 
06:09:41.310 --> 06:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
over 10 Ines in in a wind of 30 miles an
 
06:09:42.868 --> 06:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
hour we actually have to have our
 
06:09:45.030 --> 06:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
employees work remotely um out of the
 
06:09:47.750 --> 06:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
building um this last uh this past
 
06:09:50.110 --> 06:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
winter we did have the the snow load uh
 
06:09:52.110 --> 06:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
fortunately before um this week's high
 
06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
winds we we did get a snow melt so we
 
06:09:56.708 --> 06:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have to have Personnel um not
 
06:09:59.150 --> 06:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
work in the office but um we see it as
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
becoming a priority we do believe that
 
06:10:03.750 --> 06:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh the warehouse does not need need to
 
06:10:05.750 --> 06:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
be re replaced the number that we have
 
06:10:08.910 --> 06:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
you that one 1.97 is really a design
 
06:10:11.590 --> 06:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
build for um a professional office
 
06:10:13.070 --> 06:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
building that supports division in ports
 
06:10:15.070 --> 06:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
and harbers and some of the entities the
 
06:10:16.750 --> 06:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that work out of the 55
 
06:10:19.868 --> 06:10:19.878 align:start position:0%
Market Street Terminal in in in
 
06:10:21.990 --> 06:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth are there any questions on
 
06:10:23.910 --> 06:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
the projects
 
06:10:27.070 --> 06:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative Brown thank you
 
06:10:31.510 --> 06:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so um on your guess third
 
06:10:34.150 --> 06:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
page pment to commercial fishing perer
 
06:10:35.788 --> 06:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
building replacement
 
06:10:37.868 --> 06:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
I was reading that this is uh for lapse
 
06:10:40.468 --> 06:10:40.478 align:start position:0%
extensions but in the dialogue there it
 
06:10:41.830 --> 06:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
says that the building sits on
 
06:10:43.868 --> 06:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.9 Acres above water
 
06:10:46.750 --> 06:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
location is currently over 50% shutdown
 
06:10:48.310 --> 06:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
due to the presence of black mold
 
06:10:50.708 --> 06:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
identified in recent condition survey
 
06:10:52.430 --> 06:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
the wooden structure has deterior is at
 
06:10:54.310 --> 06:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
the end of its useful existence and is
 
06:10:56.590 --> 06:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
need of replacement so is there an
 
06:10:58.910 --> 06:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
upcoming project for this should I miss
 
06:11:00.390 --> 06:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry representative Brown that
 
06:11:01.750 --> 06:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
that actually building has through the
 
06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
oper funding project that was about $1
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
million division of ports Harbor self
 
06:11:07.990 --> 06:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
funded about 225,000 on that that
 
06:11:10.670 --> 06:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
building has been demolished um and we
 
06:11:12.190 --> 06:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
are starting to work on the foundation
 
06:11:13.990 --> 06:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
and utility work and we hope to have
 
06:11:16.590 --> 06:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
that building fully operational by June
 
06:11:19.310 --> 06:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
1 of this year okay so so we don't have
 
06:11:20.830 --> 06:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
to worry about that I'm sorry the black
 
06:11:22.628 --> 06:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
mold is gone thank you very much I
 
06:11:27.070 --> 06:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:30.468 --> 06:11:30.478 align:start position:0%
Edgar oh thank you Mr chair I had a
 
06:11:33.070 --> 06:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
couple questions uh one of them I'm
 
06:11:35.070 --> 06:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
trying to see if I can get a page number
 
06:11:36.948 --> 06:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
on but
 
06:11:41.350 --> 06:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh this one here anyway I we got do with
 
06:11:43.510 --> 06:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
some of the Dron showing uh we'll call
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
it the main pair dredging diagram main
 
06:11:48.830 --> 06:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah maintenance dredge plan
 
06:11:52.510 --> 06:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
is is a engineering draw in there um
 
06:11:54.510 --> 06:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
that shows some along the you know along
 
06:11:57.510 --> 06:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
the pier itself then there's a uh
 
06:11:59.548 --> 06:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
another one later on it's got all the
 
06:12:02.430 --> 06:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
red on it and I'm trying to again page
 
06:12:04.708 --> 06:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
number I don't have one but it shows a
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
lot more dring um is this request to do
 
06:12:12.270 --> 06:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
all the in all that's in red I'm under
 
06:12:13.788 --> 06:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
the impression that this request is to
 
06:12:16.750 --> 06:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
do along the warf the red is actually
 
06:12:18.948 --> 06:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
part of uh what Federal Highway
 
06:12:21.628 --> 06:12:21.638 align:start position:0%
Department um owes the state of New
 
06:12:24.270 --> 06:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for the for the Sarah Sarah
 
06:12:26.468 --> 06:12:26.478 align:start position:0%
along Bridge replacement yes sir you I
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that follow yeah that's
 
06:12:31.150 --> 06:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
and that's why I was asking so what's
 
06:12:33.270 --> 06:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
the status of that the status of that is
 
06:12:36.708 --> 06:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
it's still factored in uh the Do's uh
 
06:12:39.788 --> 06:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
program and I believe that we just were
 
06:12:42.390 --> 06:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
received that uh a perming a perming
 
06:12:44.230 --> 06:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
application is is starting to be
 
06:12:46.510 --> 06:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
processed that hopefully will kick
 
06:12:48.030 --> 06:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
through the Army Corp of Engineers that
 
06:12:49.070 --> 06:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
will hopefully start to kick that
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
project off
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
but I'm
 
06:12:56.468 --> 06:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
sorry hope we out to bid in
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
May yeah okay that's so that will be
 
06:13:02.150 --> 06:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
done one more please follow up thank you
 
06:13:04.150 --> 06:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay and um the other one is when you
 
06:13:06.468 --> 06:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
start talking about work at at Ry in
 
06:13:09.910 --> 06:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
Hampton Harbor um you look at the
 
06:13:12.990 --> 06:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
narrative the uh just Agency number you
 
06:13:13.000 --> 06:13:16.110 align:start position:0%
narrative the uh just Agency number you
know

06:13:16.110 --> 06:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:19.110 --> 06:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
013 talks about rip wrap here but there
 
06:13:21.750 --> 06:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
also was a problem as it mentions here
 
06:13:25.270 --> 06:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
with the uh ramps going down in is this
 
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
request to also repair the
 
06:13:30.070 --> 06:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
ramps so the division of ports and
 
06:13:31.868 --> 06:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
harbor self-funded the immediate repair
 
06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
of the ramp after the
 
06:13:38.750 --> 06:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
202 for king tide yeah um this this
 
06:13:41.948 --> 06:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
project will strengthen the ramp and
 
06:13:44.350 --> 06:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully preserve the actual boat
 
06:13:47.468 --> 06:13:47.478 align:start position:0%
launching um pad that that allows
 
06:13:49.788 --> 06:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
recreational and Commercial vendors to
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
to launch their vehicles mo more
 
06:13:54.270 --> 06:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
importantly it uh it also strengthens
 
06:13:58.590 --> 06:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
our um infrastructure for our fuel um
 
06:14:01.030 --> 06:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
tanks in infrastructure there as well
 
06:14:04.750 --> 06:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and just just one last one please
 
06:14:07.868 --> 06:14:07.878 align:start position:0%
please the uh so the ramp is is
 
06:14:09.350 --> 06:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
completely acceptable now because it
 
06:14:10.910 --> 06:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
this that ramp's been a problem in
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
Hampton particular for years so with the
 
06:14:15.868 --> 06:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
repairs it's actually fully acceptable
 
06:14:17.830 --> 06:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
now it's represent vard I'm going to
 
06:14:19.670 --> 06:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
defer to Tom Maciel our operations
 
06:14:21.788 --> 06:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
manager who's a bit more familiar with
 
06:14:23.948 --> 06:14:23.958 align:start position:0%
Hampton than I
 
06:14:26.430 --> 06:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
am again it's Tom Macio operations
 
06:14:28.270 --> 06:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
manager division ports and
 
06:14:33.788 --> 06:14:33.798 align:start position:0%
harvers Sir the 2024 storm uh I'm not I
 
06:14:35.708 --> 06:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
haven't read the paperwork in front of
 
06:14:37.590 --> 06:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
you but the repairs done at the boat
 
06:14:40.030 --> 06:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
ramp was in Ry Harbor uh the Hampton
 
06:14:41.990 --> 06:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
Harbor boat ramp was not damaged from
 
06:14:43.948 --> 06:14:43.958 align:start position:0%
the store we do recognize it's in a
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
state of bad repair um but that's not
 
06:14:48.310 --> 06:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
the item that uh director Breen was
 
06:14:48.320 --> 06:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
the item that uh director Breen was
speaking

06:14:49.430 --> 06:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
06:14:52.708 --> 06:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
on I apologize I was thinking of the Rye
 
06:14:56.430 --> 06:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
boat launch um but we we would be
 
06:14:58.670 --> 06:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
Associated $73,000 worth of funds at
 
06:15:00.468 --> 06:15:00.478 align:start position:0%
Hampton through this project to
 
06:15:02.110 --> 06:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
specifically address some of the issues
 
06:15:05.070 --> 06:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
there s one more thank you so is there
 
06:15:07.628 --> 06:15:07.638 align:start position:0%
any plan on actually making the Hampton
 
06:15:10.670 --> 06:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
ramp to be in better shape it's it's
 
06:15:14.110 --> 06:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's pretty rough right well we what we
 
06:15:16.510 --> 06:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
have before you is our Capital project
 
06:15:20.270 --> 06:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh state funded um we do continuously
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
work on our internal funded programs and
 
06:15:25.670 --> 06:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
that is on our our wish
 
06:15:28.510 --> 06:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
list thank
 
06:15:32.590 --> 06:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:34.788 --> 06:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
questions representative cluder thank
 
06:15:34.798 --> 06:15:35.430 align:start position:0%
questions representative cluder thank
you

06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:15:38.788 --> 06:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
and this is about the third page in uh
 
06:15:40.628 --> 06:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
again I got the mar Street marine
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
terminal at the very bottom a reduction
 
06:15:45.910 --> 06:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
in total cost of project isve done in
 
06:15:48.390 --> 06:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
conjunction with functional replacement
 
06:15:51.910 --> 06:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
of barge Dock and it would be reduced
 
06:15:54.430 --> 06:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
according to this information
 
06:15:56.948 --> 06:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
$250,000 a quarter of a million but
 
06:15:59.990 --> 06:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
something about that project is 100%
 
06:16:02.350 --> 06:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
federally funded would there be any
 
06:16:04.270 --> 06:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
state cost if you decide to include it
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
in capital budget but yet and and you
 
06:16:09.708 --> 06:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
know if we did this all at once yeah
 
06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so we're recognizing from our
 
06:16:12.868 --> 06:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
professional Engineering Services in the
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
Army Corp of Engineers that there would
 
06:16:16.708 --> 06:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
be a savings of
 
06:16:19.990 --> 06:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
$250,000 if it coincided with uh the
 
06:16:23.910 --> 06:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
main Warf uh dredge okay follow up I
 
06:16:26.548 --> 06:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
want something about 100% federally
 
06:16:28.788 --> 06:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
funded would there be any money the
 
06:16:31.150 --> 06:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
state would have to put up for this
 
06:16:34.070 --> 06:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
functional replacement of the bar St no

sir there's not there's no State share
 
06:16:37.990 --> 06:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's owed to us from the Federal Highway
 
06:16:39.468 --> 06:16:39.478 align:start position:0%
project it would be
 
06:16:41.548 --> 06:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
allal correct
 
06:16:44.990 --> 06:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
corre Mr Shay would we need any uh more
 
06:16:48.510 --> 06:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:51.190 --> 06:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
that provided to us
 
06:16:53.670 --> 06:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
by I I would just want to talk with them
 
06:16:55.030 --> 06:16:55.040 align:start position:0%

follow up on that and get back to us on
 
06:17:02.070 --> 06:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
Tuesday y representative
 
06:17:05.590 --> 06:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
kazinski thank you um that we house
 
06:17:07.628 --> 06:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
there's a am I correct there's like 20
 
06:17:10.510 --> 06:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
people working in there now uh I would
 
06:17:13.548 --> 06:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
reduce that to about six yeah six full
 
06:17:15.948 --> 06:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and then we do have
 
06:17:19.510 --> 06:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh part-time employees report
 
06:17:22.468 --> 06:17:22.478 align:start position:0%
reporting muster there followup yeah and
 
06:17:24.750 --> 06:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh so you're looking to replace it with
 
06:17:27.430 --> 06:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
the with the uh with an office building
 
06:17:29.830 --> 06:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
correct uh unfortunately the way that it
 
06:17:31.868 --> 06:17:31.878 align:start position:0%
was designed the the original Warehouse
 
06:17:34.430 --> 06:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
was built in the 1970s I believe the
 
06:17:36.430 --> 06:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
office building was was constructed our
 
06:17:39.548 --> 06:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
cinder block in 2005 as part of the into
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
part of the warehouse we're being told
 
06:17:43.750 --> 06:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
by our architectural firms that you
 
06:17:45.868 --> 06:17:45.878 align:start position:0%
cannot take down the warehouse without
 
06:17:47.670 --> 06:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
sacrificing the Integrity of the
 
06:17:49.430 --> 06:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
existing office building so it would be
 
06:17:51.430 --> 06:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
a demolition of the warehouse which is
 
06:17:53.430 --> 06:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
factored into the cost estimate and then
 
06:17:55.548 --> 06:17:55.558 align:start position:0%
a construction of a new specific office
 
06:17:57.390 --> 06:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
building to support division in Porton
 
06:17:59.948 --> 06:17:59.958 align:start position:0%
Harbors so what's that like a two
 
06:18:02.590 --> 06:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
twostory building or something um we we
 
06:18:04.350 --> 06:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
actually have some conceptuals based on
 
06:18:05.670 --> 06:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
on on from other buildings that we've
 
06:18:09.310 --> 06:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
seen But essentially uh about a one
 
06:18:11.868 --> 06:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
about a two-story height building one
 
06:18:14.468 --> 06:18:14.478 align:start position:0%
that is you know about six offices a
 
06:18:17.030 --> 06:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
conference room and file storage and
 
06:18:19.590 --> 06:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
some some Workshop area for the harbor
 
06:18:20.868 --> 06:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
Masters and other people to be able to
 
06:18:25.670 --> 06:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:30.350 --> 06:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
work and a kitchen any further
 
06:18:32.910 --> 06:18:32.920 align:start position:0%

of how that works um I might even stop
 
06:19:48.788 --> 06:19:48.798 align:start position:0%

have the uh public hearing and at 10:30
 
06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to start uh whittling that
 
06:20:02.468 --> 06:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
150 or 60 million that they want down to
 
06:20:05.390 --> 06:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
a reasonable amount
 
06:20:07.510 --> 06:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Shay Mr chair just to follow up on
 
06:20:10.628 --> 06:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
the P's and the um project that repon
 
06:20:12.868 --> 06:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
cluder was asking about so the Market
 
06:20:15.548 --> 06:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
Street U Marine Terminal main Warf
 
06:20:18.270 --> 06:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
dredging has already deducted that
 
06:20:21.150 --> 06:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
$250,000 so you'll see that um if you
 
06:20:22.990 --> 06:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
were to flip there's a page with a
 
06:20:25.948 --> 06:20:25.958 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet on it and there's some ink
 
06:20:28.670 --> 06:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
writing it looks like ink
 
06:20:31.310 --> 06:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
writing I don't have a page
 
06:20:33.390 --> 06:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
number actually on the bottom of it it
 
06:20:36.510 --> 06:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
says page one of one one that says so if
 
06:20:39.468 --> 06:20:39.478 align:start position:0%
you go to page one of one yeah it's from
 
06:20:43.948 --> 06:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
it's from Andover Apple door Marine
 
06:20:46.468 --> 06:20:46.478 align:start position:0%
yes you'll see that the The Authority
 
06:20:48.590 --> 06:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
had already taken the deduction of that
 
06:20:51.070 --> 06:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
$250,000 from the project so there would
 
06:20:53.430 --> 06:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
be no change needed then we no longer
 
06:20:56.430 --> 06:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
need any further
 
06:20:59.548 --> 06:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
verbage so anyway that's where we're at
 
06:21:02.230 --> 06:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
see some of you on Friday the rest of
 
06:21:03.310 --> 06:21:03.320 align:start position:0%

not and we're going to hammer on them so
 
06:21:30.510 --> 06:21:30.520 align:start position:0%

06:21:33.150 --> 06:21:33.160 align:start position:0%

06:21:35.590 --> 06:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
