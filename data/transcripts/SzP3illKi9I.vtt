one issue to bring to the committee's
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
attention which is on page seven of the

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
the rule expired in 2017

however the
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
originating statute rsa 126 9 has a
 
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
civil penalty of 100 per day for
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
non-compliance so the agency can enforce
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
compliance without the rule in place
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%

testimony which i believe is included
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the packet
 
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.389 align:start position:0%
in the packet
i

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
will not um
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
read that chapter and verse
 
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.030 align:start position:0%
read that chapter and verse
in

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
an effort to
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
have one other thing to add which i will
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
do at the end
 
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.389 align:start position:0%
do at the end
um

00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
the rule as it appears before you
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
does not adequately provide the services
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
provided to the recipients of the waiver
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
i spoke only to the service that i
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
myself provide in a different waiver not
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
in this waiver just to be clear i do not
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
provide services in this waiver nor do i
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
have any intention of ever doing so the
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
rule impacts the state's costs for
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
long-term care
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
as well as the state's reliance on a 50
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
funding match the match is jeopardized
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
when services are not provided in
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%

definitions in the rule
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
is that they have another process going

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
simultaneously where they are developing
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
a manual
 
00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:16.069 align:start position:0%
a manual
and

00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:16.949 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
manual will
 
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.189 align:start position:0%
manual will
define

00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
define
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
the services
 
00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.030 align:start position:0%
the services
i

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
do not think the department should be
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
allowed to rely on an alternate process
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
so for example to develop rules because
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
the legislative input and the consumer
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
input is not as robust so i've included
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
in your packet
 
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.829 align:start position:0%
in your packet
the

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
manual the draft manual i should say
 
00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:52.629 align:start position:0%
manual the draft manual i should say
draft

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
which has a very robust definition of
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
service coordination that i could
 
00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.150 align:start position:0%
service coordination that i could
support

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.949 align:start position:0%
support
so

00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to understand why we can't
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
have that in rule and to have it be
 
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
have that in rule and to have it be
approved

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
by this committee
 
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.430 align:start position:0%
by this committee
um

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
you brought this all up at the public
 
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.829 align:start position:0%
you brought this all up at the public
hearing

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
i brought this all up as chair of the
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
medical care advisory committee i
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
participated in the
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
sub committee on this rule
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
these suggestions were made to the
 
00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:34.150 align:start position:0%
these suggestions were made to the
department

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
as i was um working
 
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
as i was um working
on

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.710 align:start position:0%
on
another

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
issue yesterday
 
00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:44.069 align:start position:0%
issue yesterday
um

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
i came across an error in the rule
 
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.430 align:start position:0%
i came across an error in the rule
and

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's in 5
 
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.710 align:start position:0%
it's in 5
24

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.870 align:start position:0%
24
16

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
there is a sentence about whether or not
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
remote services
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
should be provided in hospitals and it
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
cannot it says that they can i believe
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's an error and that would be in
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
letter d
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
in regard to remote services
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
there are currently many many bills
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
pending in both bodies of the
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislature in regard to telehealth
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
there are two bills specifically
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 390 and senate bill 430
 
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.789 align:start position:0%
senate bill 390 and senate bill 430
which

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
grossly paraphrasing here set out
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
guidance for the provision of
 
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.909 align:start position:0%
guidance for the provision of
telehealth

00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.789 align:start position:0%
i think
calling

00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
calling
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
something remote
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
when what it actually is is
 
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.029 align:start position:0%
when what it actually is is
telehealth

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
is is a slippery slope it's what what
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
they're defining as acute and remote
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
services is telehealth it was
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
discussed as telehealth but the word
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
telehealth is missing
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
from the rule so i am very concerned
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
that the other work these bodies are
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
doing on telehealth would not apply to
 
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.230 align:start position:0%
doing on telehealth would not apply to
this

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
problem with the use of the term
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
remote services
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
is that remote services are defined in
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
and there are codes for them
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
in the medicaid coding manual
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
where telehealth is a modality for the
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
delivery of services
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
and that should
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
be a modifier to the service that we're
 
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.789 align:start position:0%
be a modifier to the service that we're
delivering

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
delivering
 
00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:03.669 align:start position:0%
delivering
so

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the the language used in the
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
acute and remote services section
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
is hugely problematic and inconsistent
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for your time i would be
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions okay next
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from mindy hawkins
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
and sarah kutrubas who
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
oppose the rule also
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%

area

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
sure i'm here today to address two
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
concerns with the 524 that is proposed
 
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
concerns with the 524 that is proposed
today

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
um we did i did provide this
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation in writing and received
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
receipt from messino
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
on january 10th and when the final rule
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's before you today came out we did
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
not see changes based on those
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations and i'm here today to
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
speak about two areas
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
the first area is um
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
524.03 which indicates that a functional
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
screen will be required within three
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
days of eligibility to in-home support
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
there are questions in the way the 524
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
is written about what determines the
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility date
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
the response we also received from
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
attorney nimmith as well as what's
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
written in the 52403 indicates that it's
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
when they became eligible for early
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
supports and services or the
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
developmental disability waiver
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
in some cases those individuals might
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
have became eligible five or six years
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
ago before they ask for an in-home
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
supports waiver service
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
and it says that we must also submit
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
the two factors which is a statewide
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
assessment meaning eligibility on that
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
the functional screen is required to
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
determine level of care in the
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
in-home supports waiver that was
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the center by the center of
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
medicaid and medicare services it
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
indicates the functional screen will be
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
completed as part of the prior
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
authorization packet including the
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
service agreement the budget and the
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
functional screen
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
the functional screen when it is
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
submitted for the first time must be
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
signed off by an rn
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
so the concern is is that we're
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
completing a functional screen when we
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
have not done a person-centered plan as
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
required in the in-home supports waiver
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have not done the health risk
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
screening tool assessment which provides
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
formal assessment for us to base the
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
level of care on in which that we're
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
documenting the functional screen
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
if i give a functional screen to a nurse
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
with no
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
service agreement and no assessment how
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
is that nurse to determine and sign off
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
that the functional screen is met it's
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
merely speaking with the family and
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
checking off the boxes and it creates a
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerability the recommendation
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
provided in writing was that we continue
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
to provide the functional screen with
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
the service agreement and the assessed
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
tool at time of application for the
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
in-home supports waiver and that was not
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
supported or documented in the proposed
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
rule in front of you
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
can i just add one thing um just to kind
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
of break it down even further
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.549 align:start position:0%
excuse me
what

00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
what we are recommending or what we're
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
asking for you to recommend is that
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
this all be done in the way that it's
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
done now
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
this in-home support waiver is not
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
offered to every child who is eligible
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
for area agency services these are
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
waivered services for children
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
and it's important to note that there
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
are limited slots and limited
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
um money
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
for these services so if we were to do
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
this at the intake the original intake
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
what our what our concern is is that
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
every family then now understands that
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
they may be eligible for the in-home
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
support waiver
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that we will have to add them then
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
to the registry
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
and put them on a waiting list for those
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
services because those slots are so
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
limited for children so whereas now we
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
are getting to know families we're
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
starting to understand what it is that
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
and only then
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
would we offer potentially this waiver
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
service to them based on their needs
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
instead what we fear will happen is that
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
every family when hearing about
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
the great supports offered in the
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
in-home support waiver they too will
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
want them and then all of a sudden in a
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
year from now i will be sitting in front
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
of a lot of you during the budget and
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
saying we need more money we need more
 
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.590 align:start position:0%
saying we need more money we need more
slots

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
slots
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
because all of these people want this
 
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.630 align:start position:0%
because all of these people want this
service

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
um and so that i just want to put that
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
kind of bug in your ear that this is a
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
potential increase
 
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.909 align:start position:0%
potential increase
in

00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
cost and the individuals have to have
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid to enter this program when they
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
come in through eligibility they may not
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
have medicaid and we're completing a
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
functional screen that allows them to
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
build medicaid for this waiver and so
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
families may also be confused that
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're now eligible but until they
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
obtain medicaid they're truly not
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
eligible and so it should be at that
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
juncture that we put them on the
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
registry based on their assessment
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
though families do know about this
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
service and it's part of our service
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
array when they come into the area
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
agency system
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
the second area that we're looking to
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
ask for your support in today is around
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
some language in the 524
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
0.20 around in-home support service
 
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.950 align:start position:0%
0.20 around in-home support service
agreements

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
there is a section three which indicates
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the service coordinator shall visit
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
the individual and contact the guardian
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
in person or through video call at least
 
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.669 align:start position:0%
in person or through video call at least
quarterly

00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
the in-home supports waiver that is
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the center for medicaid and
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
medicare services requires monthly
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
contact either in person or via phone
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
contact it does require quarterly
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
documentation of satisfaction in a
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
number of areas and it does require on
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
page 130 that the family or participant
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
indicate how many in-person home visits
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
they would like to select with a minimum
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
of two
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
as the minimum standard
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
this uh asks to have us visit quarterly
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
is not reflected in the in-home supports
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
waiver it does not
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
mention the
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
503.110 where this is mentioned where
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
the rest of the waiver indicates that
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
the center of medicaid and medicare
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
services is not looking for us to report
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
on quarterly face-to-face
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
meetings with families they're looking
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
for us to provide them monthly contact
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
quarterly documentation of satisfaction
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
and a minimum of two home visits this
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
would be an additional burden we
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
understand that at times we're asked to
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
do more one of the biggest complaints
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
we're getting from families right now is
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
that with the increased
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
oversight from the center of medicaid
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
and medicare services and at times from
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
our bureau of developmental services is
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
that their service coordination feels
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
more like checking boxes and less like
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
having that expert who really knows
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
their family and is using a
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
person-centered approach to address
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
issues that affect them immediately and
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
that will change their lives which is
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
truly the responsibility of service
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
coordination when we ask for these
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
additional things that are not required
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
by the waiver it takes away our ability
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
to focus on the things the families
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
actually are asking us to help them with
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
and it does not put our medicaid match
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
at risk because center of medicaid and
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
medicare services is not asking for that
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
or looking for that because we did not
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
commit to that in our waiver so we're
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
asking this committee to
 
00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
asking this committee to
keep

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the 524 face-to-face
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
to what is documented clearly in the
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
waiver submitted
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
let's have a motion for an objection to
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
the rule based on the testimony um
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
senator i just have one question what
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
what rule are you referring to can you
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
give me the citation again for that one
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%

senator rager i'm sorry i'm not sure
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
that the testimony given was given on
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
you can interrogate the witnesses and
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
find out what they're
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm having trouble finding
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
exactly what they're talking to
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
um as
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
maybe alison can help clarify i'm not
 
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:00.710 align:start position:0%
maybe alison can help clarify i'm not
sure

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
so i did find that i had a question but
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
i think i figured in a preliminary
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
objection they could fix it but there
 
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
objection they could fix it but there
was

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
in the section they were talking about
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
that does talk about quarterly visits
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
the individual but then it talks
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
section two right above it talks about
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
monthly visits
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so i'm not sure which one applied to
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
the cms and which one didn't
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the ones that were provided on our
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
packet it's on page
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh the comments you're making
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
are they to the final proposal or to the
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
it should say in the header of the rule
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's the final rule the final version
 
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
it's the final rule the final version
well

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was someone directed to us by the
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
department there is if at the very top
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the right hand corner does it say
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request for 222.
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%

00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay so that should be this
 
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.230 align:start position:0%
okay so that should be this
okay

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's under specifically under in-home
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
all right i found it
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay this proposal makes changes to the
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
licensing rules for occupational
 
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
licensing rules for occupational
therapists

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
the board has filed a conditional
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
approval request which you do have
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
linked on your agenda
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
that conditional approval request pretty
 
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.509 align:start position:0%
that conditional approval request pretty
much

00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
resolves all of the concerns
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
there is one issue and um
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's regarding a citation to an allied
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
health rule
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the licensing fee and the
 
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.149 align:start position:0%
regarding the licensing fee and the
comment

00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
occurs in several places but if you look
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
you go to that
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
you will find the first instance of the
 
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.269 align:start position:0%
you will find the first instance of the
comment

00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
and so here
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
what the issue is is that
 
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
that rule at the allied health rule at
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
301.02 doesn't actually contain any
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for occupational
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
therapists it's written as if it's just
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
for licensure and certification of
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
speech language assistance so in
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
conversation with tina kelly from oplc
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
they are aware of this issue and plan to
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
bring this forward to the allied health
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
board at their next meeting so that they
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
can consider some rulemaking to
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
fix that section of the rule and tina is
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
here and can speak more about that issue
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm tina kelly from the
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
certification i'm a program specialist
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
and in ahp 301.02 which addresses the
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
fees for all of the allied health boards
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
the header says schedule fees for
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
licensure and for certification of
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
speech language
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
assistance it was meant to be both the
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
licensees and the speech language
 
00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.789 align:start position:0%
licensees and the speech language
assistance

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
so if you read it all together it makes
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
it sound like it's just for licensure
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
and certification of speech language
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
assistance but it's meant for both and
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at the
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
the table of the um fees it does
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
specifically say licensure and
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
certification so but i'm going to take
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
that back to the board of directors of
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
the allied health professionals they
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
meet on 428 of 2022
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
um and rework that opening sentence and
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.909 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:21.909 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah the deadline is on the 29th of this
 
00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:28.549 align:start position:0%
yeah the deadline is on the 29th of this

00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
the committee would need to ask for a
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%

00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%

the agency
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
first filed an objection response that
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
deleted everything in the section
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
including what was currently in the rule
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
i mean you can see that in the last
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
couple of pages of the linked pdf
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the um amended objection response it
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much puts the rule back to where
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
it was before rule making began
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the rulemaking was to
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
address the implementation of house bill
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
250 from the last session
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
that would um prohibit the transfer of
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
animals over i think the numbers over 49
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
but um we had some back and forth with
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
the agency and this is where they landed
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
just to put it back
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
to where it was and as i said we don't
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
have any additional comments but we
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know if the committee may have
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
good morning center morning committee
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
steve crawford state veterinarian new
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh mr chair
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh just curious when you are going to
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're not sure the law didn't require
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
rule making to implement it created if
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
you um and i brought it here so i could
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
read the language
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
so the legislature changed the
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
definition of pet vendor
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
to mean
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
any entity that transfers 30 or more
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
dogs cats ferrets etc
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
all license
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
and then in 437.3
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
no pet vendor shall transfer animals
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
without a license that's always been the
 
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.349 align:start position:0%
without a license that's always been the
standard

00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
the addition here was that
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it's always been a requirement to
 
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.470 align:start position:0%
and it's always been a requirement to
have

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
proof of zoning before we issue a
 
00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:50.950 align:start position:0%
proof of zoning before we issue a
license

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature in august of last year
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh created a standard that
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
no lice no zoning proof is required
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
until someone reaches 50
 
00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.829 align:start position:0%
until someone reaches 50
animals

00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
so we can still issue a license and we
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
have without zoning approval i think
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
there are three entities thus far that
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
have been licensed without zoning
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
approval no one's reached the 50 yet
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
so we've begun to to do that we just
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to the
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i think the from our discussion with
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
gelco attorneys
 
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.190 align:start position:0%
gelco attorneys
the

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
process for
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
someone who reaches 50 animals without
 
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.589 align:start position:0%
someone who reaches 50 animals without
providing

00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
proof of zoning is already in statute in
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
541 and in our agr 200 rules in terms of
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
how we handle notifications and hearings
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
do i understand you correctly that if
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
someone has a business and they only
 
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.069 align:start position:0%
someone has a business and they only
sell

00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
sell
 
00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:45.829 align:start position:0%
sell
29

00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
29
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
animals during a year
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
they don't need to be licensed so they
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't need zoning approval
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so they're essentially three three
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
levels so 29 animals are less than a
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
year you don't need to be licensed with
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
us regulated by us
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
30 to 49 requires a license without
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
zoning approval 50 and up requires a
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
i sure hope everybody understands that
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're trying to come we're trying to
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
move to approve second
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%

mr chairman yes on the previous item in
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
order to postpone that is going to
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
require a waiver of the committee's
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
deadline so if you had
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
if you uh wished a member to
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
make a motion to postpone and seek a

00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh just want to make the committee aware
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
that starting on may 6 we are going to
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
have another attorney working for us her
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
name is rebecca ricard which currently
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
works at dcyf
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
we have since sending out the letter
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
notifying agencies of expiring rules
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
we are having an uptick in the
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and it looks like
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
at the current rate we'll have at least
 
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.390 align:start position:0%
at the current rate we'll have at least
200

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
200
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
proposals this year
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you senator i think we still have
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
item uh
 
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.030 align:start position:0%
item uh
2021-112

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
the one-off consent
 
00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:00.550 align:start position:0%
the one-off consent
okay

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
um as this was on consent the committee
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
staff have no comments but i believe
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
just come on up if you
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
pulled out the card
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
i also think it's um important that i
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
point out that um one of the people
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
testifying is actually the owner of the
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
daycare that my child goes to
 
00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:35.030 align:start position:0%
daycare that my child goes to
um

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
so just
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
to put that out there um i don't think
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
that there is any conflict but um if
 
00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:42.790 align:start position:0%
that there is any conflict but um if
if

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
we decide otherwise one of the other
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

different ways of doing things and try
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
to be objective of looking at things
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
but in these particular roles and i was
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
just told
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
that it didn't really matter but
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of child care centers are at work
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
right now it's very hard for us to even
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
get out to be able to come up here and
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i've been trying to listen to a whole
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
lot of other people and what they're
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
saying too so bear with me but a big
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
problem that we're having is this whole
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting issue
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
wanting safe people to be working with
 
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.910 align:start position:0%
wanting safe people to be working with
children

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
and we know that they should be
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted and background checked etc
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know where exactly in the role
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
and hopefully melissa can help us out
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
she said it's a different issue but i do
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
need to bring it up because before a
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
person can be working for you they need
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
to be fingerprinted but the wait time is
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
so ridiculous that you end up losing
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
great staff members
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
um there's got to be a way to fix this i
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody has any great
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
ideas but we're open to that
 
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.430 align:start position:0%
ideas but we're open to that
um

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
and and maybe like if you can be
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted in doe you maybe could be
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
also okay for dhhs and
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to fix that but that's
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
a huge problem that one day when i have
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
more time we will look at
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
um specific rules that i'd like to look
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
basically what's get what gets posted on
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
the internet um and who and how it gets
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
so if we we could look at that a little
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
bit closer
 
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
bit closer
um

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
page 26 there's an evacuation plan
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
i personally was on the phone with my
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company for
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
roughly about an hour
 
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.710 align:start position:0%
roughly about an hour
because

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
my program specifically does not um
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
ensure children going off premises
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
and under this specific rule we have to
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
practice an evacuation off-site bomb
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
threats once per year
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
i understand why they might want that
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
but how do you do that when you're the
 
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.870 align:start position:0%
but how do you do that when you're the
owner

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
owner
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i can't bring the children
 
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.230 align:start position:0%
and i can't bring the children
off-premises

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
off-premises
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
so i feel as though that rule needs to
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
be lifted on page 26.
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
again i'm sorry these rules are
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
different than the rule book that we're
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
using now so i'm going back and forth um
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
the informal dispute resolution
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about this
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of times and i don't see
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
anything getting changed there
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's basically their word against our
 
00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.829 align:start position:0%
it's basically their word against our
word

00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:07.030 align:start position:0%
word
until

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's how it goes
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
um and i just don't like things
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
personally put on an internet that may
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
or may not be
 
00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.550 align:start position:0%
or may not be
true

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
on a state website
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
um so the informal dispute resolution
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
and also on page 61 i'd like to see
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
something added
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
in under
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
professional developments
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
i've read a lot of citations that have
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
been on on the state website and all and
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
i feel as though maybe some people need
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
to learn a little bit more what a
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
corrective um
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
discipline approach would be for
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
children of different ages
 
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.589 align:start position:0%
children of different ages
um

00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know and what what you could do with
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
them so maybe add
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
to our pro-solution classes
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
as we have medication and transportation
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
and things like that maybe something
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
about appropriate discipline for young
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
children and make that a mandatory class
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
did you receive notice of the public
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
hearing for these rules i did and
 
00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.630 align:start position:0%
hearing for these rules i did and
unfortunately

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.750 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
um

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
i'm working about 24 7 as i'm sure other
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
people are too and i was unable to make
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
i again these are things that were
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
brought up there but now here they are
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i just don't i can't just say here
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
let's pass them because i'm
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm on the other end but i try to look
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
at things on both sides
 
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.790 align:start position:0%
at things on both sides
so

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening i appreciate
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
and um i am the owner of the tots pot
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i do have
 
00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.069 align:start position:0%
and i do have
um

00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
um your child at our program and he's
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
very lovely so thank you um i'd first
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
like to thank also child care licensing
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
for the work that they have done to
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
improve these licensing rules
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of improvements and
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
they have really heard some of our
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
feedback but not all of it
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
the licensing unit had an audit by the
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
legislative committee you may be aware
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
of that um
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
and in that they found that there was
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
over 1 000
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
approximately a thousand licensing rules
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
and for any program on any given day to
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
know manage and be in compliance
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
with a thousand licensing rules is
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible it sets programs up
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
for failure
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
and worse than that it sets us up for
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
violations and infractions which could
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
lead to fines and potentially program
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
closures so i'd like to just kind of set
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
that as the tone
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of times
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
we hear programs talk about over
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
regulation and certainly
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
rules that may
 
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.190 align:start position:0%
rules that may
overstep

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
overstep
 
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.309 align:start position:0%
overstep
the

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.670 align:start position:0%
the
discretion

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
of the program or the business
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
and so a few of those i wanted to talk
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
about is hec 4002.11
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
there is a rule about children who are
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
ill and sick exclusion from programs
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
that's on page 17
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
and essentially what it
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
indicates is that
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
children shall not be excluded from
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
child care
 
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.710 align:start position:0%
child care
if

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
they do not meet one of the following
 
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.510 align:start position:0%
they do not meet one of the following
requirements

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
and they list them out i think for
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
programs that's really challenging we're
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
still in a pandemic
 
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.630 align:start position:0%
still in a pandemic
and

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
programs are with most of these children
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 20 to 50 hours a week
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
their teachers know them intimately
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the daily interactions and
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
we need to have the right
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
as programs and as private businesses to
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
decide if a child is not well enough to
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
be on our program and send them home so
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
my issue is with the word shall shall
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
means must and you'll hear me say that a
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
few times during my testimony today so i
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
just think it's too restrictive and it
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
removes the discretion of the program
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know i think that's an overstep by
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
the department so i would request that
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
that language is specifically amended
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
to remove shell
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
in addition to that um on 4002.19g
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
also tying in with that on page 29 is
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
about sick children going outside
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
and it's a mandate that if a child is
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
ill or not feeling well or perhaps has
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
an allergy
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the program shall not make them go
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
outside now our teachers must be in
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
ratio so for example with toddlers it
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
might be a one to five or one to six
 
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.549 align:start position:0%
might be a one to five or one to six
ratio

00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
ratio
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
well if you have one child whose parent
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
says they do not want them to go outside
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
it means that the other five children
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
cannot be out or that child needs to be
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
moved to a classroom
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
where perhaps
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're inside at that time period but
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
then that might put the program over
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
ratio so again i feel like programs
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
really need the ability to have the
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
discretion to say to the parent if your
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
child is not well enough
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
then perhaps
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
they either need to stay home or you
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
need to find a program that is a better
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
fit for your child's needs and your
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
family because
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
it just really
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
compromises our ability to care for the
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
entire group rather than looking at the
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
individuality of just one specific child
 
00:49:46.079 --> 00:49:46.950 align:start position:0%
individuality of just one specific child
so

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
again i think that's just an over
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
regulation of our programs
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the rules
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
the manual
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
the rules manual for programs to follow
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
it is scattered
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
it needs to be simplified i know that
 
00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.790 align:start position:0%
it needs to be simplified i know that
licensing

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
the staff have talked about they have
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
certain administrative rules that they
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
have to follow and how they format their
 
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.870 align:start position:0%
have to follow and how they format their
rules

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
but it's not user friendly and so you
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
might be going from
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know that you
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
have to have documentation of
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
immunizations on file and then you skip
 
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.910 align:start position:0%
immunizations on file and then you skip
to

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
something that's completely different
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
and so it's really difficult for
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
programs to stay in compliance with over
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
a thousand rules when they're not neatly
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
grouped together and again i think it
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
incidents where things can easily get
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
missed as legislators none of you
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
probably would be able to remember
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
a thousand laws
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
on every given day
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
and be able to implement those and speak
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
and ensure that your staff know every
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
single one of those rules as well so i
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
think it's an unrealistic
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
expectation and
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of items that i think
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
could be put into best practice um as
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
like an appendix
 
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.190 align:start position:0%
like an appendix
or

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
another way
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
to handle some of these
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
these pieces
 
00:51:14.319 --> 00:51:15.109 align:start position:0%
these pieces
um

00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
a big issue that i also have is 42.03
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
and that's time frames for departmental
 
00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.109 align:start position:0%
and that's time frames for departmental
response

00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
child care licensing
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
i believe they need to be held to
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
similar standards that they subject
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
their licensees to
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
the time frames and the discrepancies
 
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.630 align:start position:0%
the time frames and the discrepancies
between

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that they get to
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
respond and submit things back to
 
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.589 align:start position:0%
respond and submit things back to
programs

00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
is inequitable and unreasonable compared
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
to the many many incidences of time
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
frames in which license programs are
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
one in particular is providing
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
licensed programs and licensees
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
their corrective action plan from the
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
department within 21 days
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
i would make that recommendation there
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
is nowhere that i saw in the licensing
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
rules that they have a set time frame so
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
initially we that we have our monitoring
 
00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:16.230 align:start position:0%
initially we that we have our monitoring
visit

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
visit
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
and then within 21 days the licensors
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
were required to send us our statement
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
of findings in my case in 2021
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
the licensor came in july at the end of
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
july and i didn't get my statement of
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
findings until the end of september
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
that far exceeds the 21 days
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
we need some measure of accountability
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
for the department when they don't meet
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
their own time frames
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to that my particular
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
statement of findings was incorrect
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong rules were cited i requested
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
that they reissue me a correct statement
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
of findings
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
and that did not happen until mid
 
00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:54.950 align:start position:0%
and that did not happen until mid
november

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
november
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
i responded with my corrective action
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
plan which mind you um
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
my licensing visit was july 28th i
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
resolved the issue the 20 sorry the 27th
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
i resolved the issue the 28th i sent
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
them a letter i sent them the truth and
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
said this is proof of my corrective
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
action so i did it the very next day and
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
it was relative to fingerprinting my
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
employee could not get fingerprinted
 
00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.710 align:start position:0%
employee could not get fingerprinted
because

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
everyone was shut down
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
so long made short
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
i submitted my
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan once the
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
statement of findings was corrected
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
i still have not received a res an
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
official response back from the
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
department and this morning to my shock
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
i went on just to double check
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
and i found
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
that my corrective action plan was
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
posted to the internet without my
 
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.309 align:start position:0%
posted to the internet without my
knowledge

00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
and that was done on december 1st
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
the law states in 170e that they're
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
supposed to notify us six days in
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
advance i wasn't notified i still don't
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
have an official copy and this is
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
required to be posted at my center for
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
parents to review
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
and for when the licensor comes
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to be in compliance because
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
the department has not done their job
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
this is not an anomaly i'm not the only
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
program this happens to anecdotally i
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
hear from programs over and over again
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
that the time frames in which the
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
department responds is inadequate
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's taking months and months
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
and sometimes almost up to a year
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
for us to get necessary paperwork back
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
for us to be in compliance
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
so i would ask respectfully that the
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee hold licensing accountable
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
and require that they have a 21 day
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
because that's pretty consistent with
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
42.6 d
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
and with g 21 days is we have 21 days to
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
get our plan in they have 21 days i
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
would ask that they have to have 21 days
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
to get our corrective action plan back
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
because it's not reasonable that we're
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
hanging out to dry and waiting and
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
waiting and waiting
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that it should be
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
the sole onus of the program to
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
repeatedly follow up with and notify
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
cclu that we have not received our
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
paperwork back
 
00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:23.670 align:start position:0%
paperwork back
so

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
um i think that's really important and i
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
think that ties in with what kristen
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
byron talked about having things posted
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
to the internet now granted
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
my corrective action plan was fine and
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
they approved it but they should have
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
notified me i shouldn't have gone on and
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
been surprised to find
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
that on december 1st
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
that they had posted it three days
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
within receiving it from their office
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
both electronically and through
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
certified mail
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
so i just you know i i think we need to
 
00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:52.789 align:start position:0%
so i just you know i i think we need to
have

00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
fairness and equity amongst
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
time frames and responses
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing i wanted to
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
i know there's a lot of discussion about
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting is
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
set by the
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
child development block grant
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
however in our state statute 170 e7 4a
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
and 4d
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
we are required to have eligibility
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
cards eligibility card is simply proof
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
that your staff has been fingerprinted
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
and they've cleared their background
 
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.710 align:start position:0%
and they've cleared their background
checks

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
checks
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
now while the fee is set in stone in 170
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
e for fifty dollars
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
the language says that the department
 
00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.430 align:start position:0%
the language says that the department
may

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
issue an eligibility card may is not
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
shall it is not must it creates a
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
tremendous burden on
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
the individual worker who may make
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere from twelve dollars an hour on
 
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.150 align:start position:0%
anywhere from twelve dollars an hour on
average

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i also think it creates an increased
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
burden on programs i've probably spent
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
close to seven hundred to a thousand
 
00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.750 align:start position:0%
close to seven hundred to a thousand
dollars

00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
in this in the past year or so trying to
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
onboard staff who may
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
not even show up to their job but we've
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
already submitted the paperwork and the
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
department has cashed our check
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
or what happens is i probably have three
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
to five employees
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
that were fingerprinted in 2021 between
 
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.069 align:start position:0%
that were fingerprinted in 2021 between
probably

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
july and september
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
and none of those individuals have
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
received their eligibility card from the
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
department so i have paid the fifty
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
dollars a piece for them
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
the department has cashed my check and
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
they have not sent an eligibility card
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
for them so my question for you is how
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
long have you been in
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
i've been a business for 10 years for 10
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
years and how many people have failed
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
their background checks um and that i
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
have hired yes
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
none we had one individual who's kristen
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
have you had any
 
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.950 align:start position:0%
have you had any
no

00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
yeah right yep and so for the
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility cards um the state is taking
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
our money but they're not providing us
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
with the service or the card
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
and we again statute
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
according to licensing rules we're
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
required to have a copy of that
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility on card eligibility card on
 
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.549 align:start position:0%
eligibility on card eligibility card on
file

00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
file
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
so um i would actually ask that the
 
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.870 align:start position:0%
so um i would actually ask that the
committee

00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
make the decision to override
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
dhhs and not require the eligibility
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
card at this time the statute says may
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
it does not require it just requires the
 
00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:32.150 align:start position:0%
it does not require it just requires the
fee

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
and then just
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
just to lastly wrap up and i thank you
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
for your time um
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
we are i'm sure many of you have seen
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
this in the news i know many of you said
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
on other committees we are in a dire
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
workforce crisis
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
um the fissures and cracks have become
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
canyons in terms of
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
our ability to find staff let alone
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
qualified staff according to licensing
 
00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:01.270 align:start position:0%
qualified staff according to licensing
standards

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
graciously intelligently the legislature
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
gave us a huge win
 
00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:09.270 align:start position:0%
gave us a huge win
with

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
modifying and putting into statute the
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
requirements of an associate level
 
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.030 align:start position:0%
requirements of an associate level
teacher

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
however it still does not go far enough
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
programs like mine
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
are suffering we are on the brink of
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
closing because we do not have staff it
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
is the worst i've seen in 10 years and
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure kristen who has been in
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
business way longer than me
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
can tell you programs like ours never
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
went understaffed we did not have
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
problem finding employees and we do now
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
i've had positions and i know colleagues
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
that have had positions open for well
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
over a year
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
and even when we are offering
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
middle to high wages five weeks paid off
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
vacation 500 sign-on bonuses
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
we are not getting applicants so i would
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
ask and we have approached licensing
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
repeatedly to say
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
give us some leeway on the assistance
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
they are not allowed to be left alone
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
with children unless it's say
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
walking a child to the bathroom
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
transferring them between classrooms
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
sitting with them when
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for a parent when
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're sick
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not suggesting that someone who has
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
no education or experience should be
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
solely left alone with children
 
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
solely left alone with children
however

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
we need people to fill these spots and
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
loving caring parents who have life
 
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.870 align:start position:0%
loving caring parents who have life
experience

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
but they don't have college you know
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
they may not have the college credits or
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
they may not have been in a certain
 
01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.349 align:start position:0%
they may not have been in a certain
position

01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
that rises to the level that they could
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
be associate qualified per the
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
definition of the the legislation's
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
definition of associate teacher
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
allowing us to have a little bit more
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
broad leeway with assistance in a
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
classroom say
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
being able to sit alone with a child
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
or a class during nap time providing
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
that there's other qualified individuals
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
or staff in the building would go a long
 
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.430 align:start position:0%
or staff in the building would go a long
way

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
we need something more
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
to fill and to create a stop gap for for
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
the crisis that we're experiencing and
 
01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:23.510 align:start position:0%
the crisis that we're experiencing and
it's

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.349 align:start position:0%
it's
insurmountable

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
insurmountable
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
um the stress that it creates for
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
business owners the burnout that it's
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
creating amongst their colleagues for
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
losing people life right and left um
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
they can go to target and work for you
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
know twenty dollars an hour or
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's for seventeen
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
um so the the field is not appealing
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
right now and we are doing everything we
 
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.789 align:start position:0%
right now and we are doing everything we
can

01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
and for programs that have tuition as
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
their sole source of income
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
they cannot afford to pay high wages
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
we can't find substitutes even to cover
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
when people are out sick
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
so i really would encourage the
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
committee to to press
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
and impress upon licensing that we they
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
need to do more
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
and it's not so much about we want
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
quality applicants
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely we do we want educated
 
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.589 align:start position:0%
absolutely we do we want educated
applicants

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
but if we do not have workers in our
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
child cares
 
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
child cares
programs

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
parents are not going to have child care
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
because they will continue to close
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
and we have seen the numbers go down
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
drastically from how many licensed
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
programs there were even
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago and at one point
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
we were closer to a thousand and i think
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
now we might be under 700
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
and licensing will tell you that some of
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
those switched hands and some of them
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
consolidated but a lot of it is that
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
people are tired of the over regulation
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
the overreach of licensing rules and
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
they can't make ends meet
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
with the restrictions that are upon them
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
and times have changed and they were
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
changing before covid so this is not a
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
covet issue
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
so um i sorry i'm sorry for taking so
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
long i have testified at public hearings
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
i have given my input to licensing
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
and i feel like this is kind of the last
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
measure because
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
although licensing
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that they are looking forward
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
and will be willing to work more
 
01:03:18.319 --> 01:03:19.430 align:start position:0%
and will be willing to work more
collaboratively

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
collaboratively
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
continue to be more collaborative with
 
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.309 align:start position:0%
continue to be more collaborative with
programs

01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
but our history shows us that we have
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
we have made the battle cries and they
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
have not responded representative
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
mcguire so yes thank you i like to
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
comment that the requirements for
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
lowest level of staff
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
is a policy
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
fight that's been going on between
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
people that want to have
 
01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:46.390 align:start position:0%
people that want to have
more

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in child care like
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
you say the parents with life experience
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
and those who think it should be a
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
profession that requires significant
 
01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:56.230 align:start position:0%
profession that requires significant
academic

01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
academic
 
01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.430 align:start position:0%

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
background
and

01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
we've tried there have been
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
various occasions over the last few
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
years to expand the scope of life
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
experience yes but it keeps
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's never quite enough i'm afraid
 
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.870 align:start position:0%
it's it's never quite enough i'm afraid
and

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
it is a problem that we keep seeing that
 
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.789 align:start position:0%
it is a problem that we keep seeing that
the

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're running into a difference
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
of what quality is
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and of course the trade-off between
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
quality and quantity
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that you're stuck in a bind
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
but you are not alone
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes i know and i can tell you from the
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
10 years that i have been
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
in this field
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
i have had staff with master's degrees
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
and after hiring them i
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
am shocked at their inability to connect
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
with children their lack of common sense
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
and i have had
 
01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.589 align:start position:0%
and i have had
um

01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
substitutes and assistants um and young
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
young ladies who have worked with me
 
01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.950 align:start position:0%
young ladies who have worked with me
that

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
are loving caring compassionate and they
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
do really really well with children and
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
i would pick them any day over the week
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
than someone
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes with a lot of experience
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
because they don't always know how to
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
put that into practice
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
are you through with me yes thank you
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%

01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
is there any particular
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
place you want me to start or should i
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
just want me to address what we've heard
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
so far
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
well just re respond to it sure
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
to respond to
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
kristen byron who spoke first regarding
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
the fingerprinting
 
01:06:07.359 --> 01:06:09.109 align:start position:0%
the fingerprinting
and

01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
the concerns there
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
the fingerprinting is a federal
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
requirement the appointments come
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
through the division of state police so
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
we are and we don't have control over
 
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.750 align:start position:0%
we are and we don't have control over
how

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
when those appointments are available
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
how often they are so what's their
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
response to you when you say that these
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
people can't operate their businesses
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
because they can't get fingerprinted
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
we've been working with state police in
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
try to speed up their
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
a their ability to have appointments i
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
know the state police have
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
received money in order to obtain 11
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
more of the fingerprinting machines so
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
they can be placed around the state and
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're working on implementing that my
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is is that there's always
 
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
an appointment pretty much within a week
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
of when someone goes to make an
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
appointment through the state police and
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
there's state police appointments
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's also appointments available at
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
local police departments depending on
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
the community you're in
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
so programs usually can get an
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
appointment within a week they may have
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
to travel for that because they're
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
scattered around the state but they are
 
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.029 align:start position:0%
scattered around the state but they are
available

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's not soon enough i i understand the
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
pain that the child care programs are
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
going through i'm hopeful that these
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
additional machines when they come on
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
board will help increase the
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
availability of appointments um but my
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is there is usually within
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
a week depending on where you are in the
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
state you can get those appointments
 
01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:34.309 align:start position:0%
state you can get those appointments
um

01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:34.319 --> 01:07:36.069 align:start position:0%
um
it's

01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement for the federal
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
government that everyone have those
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
background record checks um kristin also
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
spoke to
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
an ability to use the department of
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
education we're not able to do that
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
because the results of those background
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
record checks have to come to the
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
and the fbi requirements do not allow
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
the sharing of fingerprint results so if
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
a fingerprint result was taken
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
school educate sau if they were done at
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
that level they can't then share that
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
those results with us we're required to
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
receive the results so it's a federal
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
requirement that we're not able to
 
01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:15.670 align:start position:0%
requirement that we're not able to
change

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i know this
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
child care providers are working with
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
our representatives at the federal level
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
to try to make some adjustments but
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's the federal rule at this time
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
01:08:27.679 --> 01:08:28.630 align:start position:0%
there's also
a

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
we're creating a study committee to look
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
at the prospect of centralizing such
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
records checks in education because it
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
is absolutely insane
 
01:08:39.679 --> 01:08:40.709 align:start position:0%
is absolutely insane
that

01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:40.719 --> 01:08:42.070 align:start position:0%
that
yes

01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
yes
that

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
somebody that happens to work
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
in more than one
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
position that requires a background
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
check should have to get a separate
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
background check for every single
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
position because we
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
the department of education can't tell
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
the department health and human services
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
yes this person is is clear
 
01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:04.229 align:start position:0%
yes this person is is clear
and

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
it may be a federal requirement but it's
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
an incredibly silly and inc and
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
and it's a ridiculous requirement so
 
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.269 align:start position:0%
and it's a ridiculous requirement so
we're

01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
i know we're looking into it because
 
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.349 align:start position:0%
i know we're looking into it because
uh

01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
that's a concern for a lot of people i
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
am very happy to help with any study
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee that you have on this um
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
there's an additional wrinkle with our
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
requirements through the office of child
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
care because we're required to do what's
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
called a national crime information
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
center check of the
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
sex offender file that rests with the
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
fbi and that our federal requirement
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
that is the only way you can get that is
 
01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:43.189 align:start position:0%
that is the only way you can get that is
through

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
a state police or a government agency
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
it's a law agency so department of ed
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't have access to check that one
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
file that we are required to check so i
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
certainly i am all for trying to
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
increase the ability for us to share
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
results but that is an additional
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
wrinkle that we have as the department
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
of health and human services and i'm
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
happy to help do your
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh excuse mr jim
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
the do those
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
access cards you give out after someone
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
is fingerprinted include the result of
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
this background check it what it says is
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
that you're eligible to work in child
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
care so the card itself shows that we
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
have done our fbi checks those and the
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
nci check our abuse and neglect checks
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
all of those checks and a person can use
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
multiple employees for license like
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
child care licensed child care
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely that that's the purpose of it
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
um employees will have that when they go
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
for a job interview to say you can see
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
that i'm current
 
01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:45.669 align:start position:0%
that i'm current
and

01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and to follow up is that
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
are why why are there cases where you
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
haven't sent those out
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
we're working through our backlog we had
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
system changes last summer with our new
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
system and we are
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
some of it has to it's a multi-prong
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
issue some of it has to do with our
 
01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.790 align:start position:0%
issue some of it has to do with our
um

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
has to do with the state police and us
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
getting results from them because they
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
shifted to their online portal for their
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
results last year we are working with
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
state police we have a spreadsheet on
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
people that we are working on getting
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
those results and making sure that we
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
can issue the cards
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
and one thing i want to impress is that
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
i am first hearing today from mrs
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
willenweber that she hasn't received the
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
cards um she
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard that i know she i'm sure
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
she has communicated in people into my
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
department and i will definitely go back
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
and check in with them on that issue but
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
if she had reached out to me directly
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
which i have
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
told providers many times we are working
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
through these issues and and i will be
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
on that as soon as i get back to the
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
office so i can provide her with an
 
01:11:52.159 --> 01:11:55.430 align:start position:0%
office so i can provide her with an
answer

01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.229 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
fees for the background record checks
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
that are currently in statute are
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
actually in senate bill or 30 right now
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
to be reduced from 50 dollars to 25
 
01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.470 align:start position:0%
to be reduced from 50 dollars to 25
dollars

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to bring that up as
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
well we are working for that relief the
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
reason in statute why we have may
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
instead of shall
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
is we did not want to require everybody
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
who works for a child care program to
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
have to have one of those cards we were
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
looking at it more for the teachers and
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of programs hire
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
janitorial staff so they're not going to
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
be hopping from child care program to
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
child care program to work they're
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
working for that one program we didn't
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's no need for them to have one of
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
those cards so that's why in statute it
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
is made instead of shall we want it to
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
have flexibility as to who and it's that
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
that is stated in rule as to who is
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.719 --> 01:12:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
mike

01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
mike
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
the public testimony you heard it was
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
compelling and
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
discussed some important issues but i
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
think it addressed policy issues
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
not bases for objection and i think many
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
of those issues may require statutory
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
changes yes
 
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.030 align:start position:0%
changes yes
yes

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
so do you folks understand that things
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
that you think we can do we can't do and
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
we understand the distress you're in
 
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.310 align:start position:0%
we understand the distress you're in
and

01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
these are things that require statutory
 
01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.830 align:start position:0%
these are things that require statutory
changes

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
in order to force
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
the agencies
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
to do things
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
um can i speak to something
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about the stress
 
01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.550 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about the stress
um

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
like um
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire stated we had
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
changed the associate teacher that is
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
now what's involved in this rule that
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
statutory change has been adopted a rule
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
we sent out guidance last october when
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
it was effective for programs to start
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
using that
 
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.229 align:start position:0%
using that
i

01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
although i i i do completely understand
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
the stress programs are under i don't
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
think the qualifications is where the
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
stress lies there are workforce
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
shortages across the state in many
 
01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.030 align:start position:0%
shortages across the state in many
industries

01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
industries
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think lowering the standards of
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
the our
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
qualified staff is going to change
 
01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
qualified staff is going to change
what

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of applicants that they
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
receive in addition to that we have a
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
waiver process i review and approve
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
waivers daily about they found someone
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
that they really liked and they want to
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
be able to hire them and have them work
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
in the position that they're hiring for
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
and we give them time to come into
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
compliance like you know we'll give them
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
a year to take the courses they need to
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
take or the training they need to have
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
that is something that we do regularly
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
all the time and i am happy to entertain
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
any waiver that a program brings to me
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
when they feel they have found the right
 
01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.390 align:start position:0%
when they feel they have found the right
candidate

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
the committee can approve the rule if
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
you feel there's a basis for objection
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
of all the things i've heard today i
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
think the most concerning is
 
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.390 align:start position:0%
think the most concerning is
the

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
statements by the people who run the
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
daycare uh centers that they're not
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
hearing with the 21 days in other words
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's not an equal
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
accountability on
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
response time and i wondered if we
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to give the agency a
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
chance to respond to that
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that 21 day response time is now in
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
the rule so that was and that was a new
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
statutory change and something that we
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
are implementing with this rule
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
so are you finding that you're able
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
could i do a follow-up
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
are you able to uh respond within 21
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
days to the centers
 
01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
we are certainly gearing up for that and
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
we once the rules pass that will
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely be what we are doing
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
we have we have definitely speeded up
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
our response time we are implementing um
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
a new system which will be live in
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
several months which will allow us to
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
have that response times be much quicker
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
but until then we have other processes
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
in place so that we are ensuring that we
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
are getting those visits out
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
i can see that that would be
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
particularly irritating
 
01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:03.510 align:start position:0%
particularly irritating
yes

01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
just just for information um
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 1507 which requires
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
investigatory program findings to be
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
timely published has passed the house
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
and is on the consent calendar in the
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
senate so that should set the timelines
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
more equitably i hope
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
if i may um my name is dorian shockley i
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
am the manager of the bureau of
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
overseeing all licensed facilities from
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
birth to end of life
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
and to the question regarding timeliness
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
it is something that has come up
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
numerous times over the course of the
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
last two to three years we have worked
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
very diligently to improve our own
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
response time we agree with the
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
community that we need to be held
 
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.470 align:start position:0%
community that we need to be held
accountable

01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
we as
 
01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:56.020 align:start position:0%
we've talked numerous times about um
 
01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.750 align:start position:0%
we've talked numerous times about um
[Music]

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
um we also struggle with workforce um
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
our support team
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
usually is five people it currently is
 
01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.070 align:start position:0%
usually is five people it currently is
two

01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
um and as the manager i've stepped in as
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
well and i can tell you with um
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
with um personal experience since
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
december our response time um has been
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
with it within 14 to
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
21 days so we have in fact improved that
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to be very clear melissa
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
she's been involved in other things
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't been as involved in the support
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
and the response time but i have been
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
based on the comments from the community
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to make that perfectly
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
clear that we are committed to that
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you i also would like to
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
add um the
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
response time in the rule 402.03 of
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
60 days is actually a 541a requirement
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
and it's um that the department must
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
respond no later than 60 days um if that
 
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
respond no later than 60 days um if that
if

01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
the committee wants that
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
to be changed they would need to do that
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
in the rule but it's not a
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a minimum requirement it's a
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee if
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
i may i am deborah nelson i am the
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
bureau chief for child development and
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
head start collaboration and we
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
administer the child care and
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
development block grant funds as well as
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
the head start collaboration office and
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
we are really invested in supporting the
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
passage of this rule because if not we
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
face potential very stiff financial
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
penalties because much of the finite
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
much of the federal requirements that
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
are in federal law for the child care
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
and development block grant
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
are going to be addressed in this rule
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
we had our first ever on state on-site
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring visit last april because the
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
office of childcare debra did state
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
on-site visits before and they decided
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
to start so new hampshire had ours last
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
april and they uncovered a number of
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
issues of non-compliance that we really
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
didn't know we were not in compliance it
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
was our interpretation of what what the
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
rule said and what we you know versus
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
what the federal um administrator said
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
so we have been give states have been
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
given technically by september 30 2021
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
all states were supposed to be in
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
complete compliance with the 2014
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
reauthorization from the ccdf block
 
01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.870 align:start position:0%
reauthorization from the ccdf block
grant

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
of course with especially background
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
checks few states are but we've got some
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know some minor issues but a few
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
more significant issues especially the
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
background check which is going to be
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
covered and put us in compliance when
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
this rule passes if it doesn't pass and
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
we we expect to get our letter probably
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the next month or so from the federal
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
office of child care telling us what
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to do to new hampshire if
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're not in compliance and we stand to
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
lose at least a million or more dollars
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
so um very concerned that you know we we
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
do whatever we can i mean i absolutely
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
my my heart and you know empathy is with
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
providers over the last year we've
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
worked closely with licensing and other
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
professionals in our division of
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
economic and housing stability to bend
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
over backwards to do whatever we could
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
to put in emergency policies to share up
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
and keep the doors open in child care we
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
got 143 million dollars of covert relief
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
funds in my little beer at one point
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
there were five of us because half were
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
out you know with the coba themselves um
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with you know all of
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
those funds getting money out to
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
providers uh changing policy to you know
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
to scale back the rules so that they
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
could just you know get people in the
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.790 align:start position:0%
could just you know get people in the
door

01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
door
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
but now we're in the position of moving
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
forward in what the federal government
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
calls the build back even better
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
phase of the pandemic just trying to you
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
know shore up for long-term
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
sustainability of programs but at the
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
same time we want to make sure that
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
people can keep their doors open we want
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that our children and
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
families are getting high quality
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
supports and services that are healthy
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
safe and and support their development
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
to prepare them for the best success in
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
school so these rules reflect not just
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
um not just one but four different
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of non-compliances that directly
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
impact us which then will impact if we
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
get federal federal penalties i don't
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
have as much money to put towards child
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
care scholarship fund for children or as
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
much money to support programs to to get
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
their quality even higher and and
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
support professionals to gain skills
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
that help them
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
be more satisfied in their positions
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
because they feel comfortable in their
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
positions and have the skills to work
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
with children we heard about the
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
challenging behaviors and that whole
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
issue in the you know the request to
 
01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.350 align:start position:0%
issue in the you know the request to
require

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
certain training around between a
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
positive behavioral supports we have a
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
lot of initiatives going on right now
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
where folks can get free coaching they
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
can take free online courses um around
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
they can't do their own fingerprinting
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
they can't get people they have people
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
that want jobs and they can't put them
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
to work so that the parents can go to
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
work of the children that they take care
 
01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.629 align:start position:0%
work of the children that they take care
of

01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
so let's not confuse it with all the
 
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.350 align:start position:0%
so let's not confuse it with all the
other

01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
998 regulations so i i understand that
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
senator i absolutely do and i think as
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
melissa was saying we've been working
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
all of us with the department of safety
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
we've been working with the federal
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
government we've been working with the
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
fbi what can we do to address that
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
problem and with the department of ed we
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
actually had a joint committee looking
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
at you know can we share you know what
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
what can we do to make this easier for
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
programs so some of it's you know above
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
our pay grade and over our heads and not
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
in our peer view but we're certainly
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
working to resolve it
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
so apparently if we don't pass the rule
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
we make things worse
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
lang moves and tucker seconds to approve
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:03.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
we'll lean on safety
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
for what
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
good that might do
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
we even offered them some some money if
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
they needed more staffing to help move
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
things along so you know whatever we can
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
do to collaborate we're happy to do so
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
and they indicated they're having
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
problems with staffing yes
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
they have to get their background checks
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
so the state is down about 20
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
of its total workforce so it's
 
01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.590 align:start position:0%
of its total workforce so it's
everybody's

01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the same situation
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
that the operators are so
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to thank uh all the people who
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
came in to speak
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
from the provider's point of view
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
we know vaguely
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
as individuals about these problems but
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
really work went into their
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
presentations and i have a better
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
grasp of the problems thank you very
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
much so you've heard the motion all
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
those in favor aye aye any opposed
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
so the rules approved but
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
to what the distress is so
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i trust the department will consider
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
making some of the minor corrections
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
operators have suggested
 
01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.629 align:start position:0%
operators have suggested
and

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
can't help with the lice with the
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
fingerprints but the other details
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
right they should pay should be
 
01:25:40.639 --> 01:25:43.030 align:start position:0%
right they should pay should be
avoidable

01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
avoidable
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay thank you
 
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.070 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay thank you
