00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
crimes already have exemptions
 
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
established and a precedent has already
 
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
been established or is this indeed the
 
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
the first of its kind
 
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh well because the way it's written um
 
00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
sewer law enforcement can get those
 
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
records upon request so all these other
 
00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
crimes are generally investigated by
 
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
state certified law enforcement officers
 
00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
i'm just in a very unique position i'm
 
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
not a state certified police officer so
 
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
i can't get those records
 
00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
so any of the other crimes whether they
 
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
be whatever crime it might be they're
 
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
usually by real police officers working
 
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
trottier

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
trottier
 
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
you testified that you work with law
 
00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement on these investigations now
 
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
and if that's so are they able to get
 
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
these records
 
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
and share them with you or if they do
 
00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
get these records for their part of the
 
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
investigation are they not able to share
 
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh when i say i work with other law
 
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies they're generally
 
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
not on my open cases so let's for
 
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
example today we just talked a moment
 
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
ago about the the vehicle that went off
 
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
the side of the road it was pulling a
 
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
trailer and it flipped over
 
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
and and i have access to all those
 
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
records i'll get a copy of the insurance
 
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
claims file we'll do our interviews with
 
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
the people uh we get a copy of the
 
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
accident report i'm really not involving
 
00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in that case there's no
 
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
reason to because there's nothing that
 
00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
they can do that i can't do i'm just
 
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
gonna do the same interviews so when i
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
say i work with law enforcement it it
 
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
um i have a case of an insurance
 
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
producer stealing 200 000 from his
 
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
customers and it's a case that the fbi
 
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
would be interested i'll work hand in
 
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
hand with the fbi in a case like that
 
00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
if i'm doing a search warrant on
 
00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
somebody's premises or on a building
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
doctor can execute a search warrant i'll
 
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
work with law enforcement then but for
 
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
the most part i would say
 
00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
90 percent of my cases i do without the
 
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 align:start position:0%

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 align:start position:0%
been any consideration to expand your
 
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
job description and your role to have
 
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 align:start position:0%

with the unit now for about 15 years and
 
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
i can say that there's never been any
 
00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
discussion about making us sworn police
 
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 align:start position:0%

safety
um

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
and a lot of questions came up that were
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
posed to
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
the insurance department regarding
 
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
the nature of the data that we have what
 
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
type of data we
 
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
are um asked to share right now and for
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
the record the department of safety has
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
no position on the amendment as it
 
00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.190 align:start position:0%
no position on the amendment as it
stands

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
stands
 
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're not the pro or khan however we
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that when any of
 
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
these types of cases come up as had been
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
already alluded to by
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
one of the representatives on the uh on
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
could this potentially be a slippery
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
slope what's the nature of the
 
00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
information that's going to be shared
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony before regarding i
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
think environmental services when they
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
came before the committee to talk a
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
little bit about sharing address
 
00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
little bit about sharing address
information

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that whatever the
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
information is that we're being that
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're sharing is information that's
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
going to be number one pertinent to the
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
nature of the request and secondly is
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to be protected at all costs
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
because as we've discussed before a lot
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
of that information
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
was obtained through a lot of uh i want
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
to say a lot of heartache but there were
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns way back in the day
 
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.789 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns way back in the day
when

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
e91 went forward with collecting and
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
maintaining the databases where a lot of
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
this information is stored long story
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
short when we spoke to the folks at the
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
insurance department about what it is
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to do we recognized
 
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
that there was this little bit of a gap
 
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
that there was this little bit of a gap
between

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a request from a
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
certified law enforcement officer versus
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
what constitutes the request from an
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
individual who's conducting a criminal
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
investigation and needs that same
 
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.430 align:start position:0%
investigation and needs that same
information

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to make sure again that
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's pertinent to the request and that
 
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
the information whatever it is that
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
they're requesting is going to be
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
protected at all costs and it's going to
 
00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 align:start position:0%
be provided within very strict guard
 
00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.710 align:start position:0%
be provided within very strict guard
rails

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
rails
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
so when we've had the conversation with
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
the folks from the insurance department
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
we did our own digging to make sure that
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
those two points are going to be
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
addressed completely and we do recognize
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
that there are statutes in place
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
relative to the protection of the
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
information that it's not subject to
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
right to know that it is going to be
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
handled in much the same way law
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials around the state
 
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
maintain evidence and dispose of
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
evidence whether it's information or
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
physical evidence and we've got those
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
assurances not only from the insurance
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
department but they're built into
 
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.390 align:start position:0%
department but they're built into
statute

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
along with that the statute requires
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department work
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
closely with the attorney general's
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
office whenever they conduct a criminal
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
investigation so we've got that nexus
 
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
between the insurance department as well
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
as a law enforcement agency when they're
 
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
conducting these investigations so we've
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
got assurances that not only is it going
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
to be specific to a criminal
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
investigation not unlike a law
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement investigation that
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
information is also going to be
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
protected so we don't have any heartburn
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
anymore about where that may end up that
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be out there in the
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
public domain that it's going to be very
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
well protected at the insurance
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
department best of based upon the best
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
practices they have in place when it
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
comes to maintaining that data and
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
holding it and disposing of it when it
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be disposed of
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
they're only looking for right now and
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong information
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
related to the timing of the call in the
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
actual call itself
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're not looking for address
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
information or any of that other data
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
however that information may come
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the criminal investigation
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
that follows up whether it's with a law
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency outside of the
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office or the
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office themselves
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
which can then obtain any further data
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
that they require
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
so again just from the department of
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
safety's perspective we don't take a
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but we do feel
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable and confident that the
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
information that they're looking for is
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
specific to the statute and within the
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
narrow guardrails associated with the
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
request right now is based upon the
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you would um this change require
 
00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.909 align:start position:0%
thank you would um this change require
rulemaking

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
it would we had just gone through that
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 106 h and the rules associated
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
saf c 7000 through
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
7013 which
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
is specific to the division of emergency
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
services and communications so we would
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
have to go through rulemaking to address
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative nader
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
hi thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
question i'm still trying to make sense
 
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.710 align:start position:0%
question i'm still trying to make sense
of

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.430 align:start position:0%
of
the

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
question that came through from a viewer
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
so yes there is a section three
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
but is it doesn't say uh
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
the words regardless of the use of such
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
information under paragraph one and two
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
so wording is important should those
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
words be included
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'll read them again regardless of the
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
use of such information under paragraph
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative if i could look at
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
so the new paragraph to be added
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
regarding the information not subject to
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
through the enhanced 9-1-1 system states
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
to the insurance department in
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
connection with an ongoing criminal
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
investigation related to insurance fraud
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
or other insurance-related criminal
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
activity and this would be added in
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
addition to but not replace any other
 
00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:34.230 align:start position:0%
addition to but not replace any other
wording

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.829 align:start position:0%

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
lorenzo
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the senate hearing that some
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
testimony was given that
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
uh by the insurance department that um
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
under the spill by statute all of the
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
records would be kept as confidential
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
and then they would be destroyed after
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
six years
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
but um are we talking paper records just
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
being a destroyer
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
internet records
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
electronic records thank you for your uh
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
question and i believe all records
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
refers to not only paper but electronic
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
as well so if we were to provide a
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
recording which in some cases we would
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
in pursuant to a request for
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
the data relative to a criminal
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
investigation any records that we would
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
provide would be destroyed whether
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
they're electronic whether they're paper
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question it might have been
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
asked already but how often does this
 
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.230 align:start position:0%
asked already but how often does this
happen

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
that the need i probably should have
 
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.949 align:start position:0%
that the need i probably should have
asked

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
the other gentleman i'm sorry but the
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
need um to
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
try to obtain these records
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and uh
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the insurance department i
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
believe our discussions have been about
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
a half a dozen times a year plus or
 
00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:57.350 align:start position:0%
a half a dozen times a year plus or
minus

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
minus
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
however other law enforcement agencies
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
will request them regularly and i know
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
the question came up earlier about the
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
process and what that process looks like
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
we have a standard process that we would
 
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.550 align:start position:0%
we have a standard process that we would
ask

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
we do ask any law enforcement agency and
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
bring up to speed the folks in the
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
insurance department should this
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
amendment pass that there is a process
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
in place that they have to fill out a
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
form we keep a record of that form we
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
keep a copy of the information that we
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
supply as well so that there's an audit
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
trail associated with whomever it is
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
that we provision that information or
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
data to
 
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.590 align:start position:0%
data to
so

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
if somebody needed to look back for
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
example to find out what was requested
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
by whom and when we have that
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
information in addition to the folks to
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
whomever it is that we provision that
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
sigmund thank you for your testimony
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
would you mind filling out just a pink
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
card so we can have that on the record
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
as well certainly mr chair thank you
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%

is there anyone else would like to
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%

yeah thank you representative de lorenzo
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i i neglected to mention in my
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
introduction that
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
representative delorenzo and i actually
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
worked very closely together on this
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
bill we had several
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
zooms back in the summer and fall of
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
last year with the with the judge's
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
office um
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this was something
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
they wanted us to take up and to see how
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
we could assist so
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
um the landlord tenant mediation program
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
has been ongoing for almost a year i
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
believe richard's going to come correct
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
me anything i say wrong um
 
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.150 align:start position:0%
me anything i say wrong um
and

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
thus far has been successful at keeping
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
up to 80 percent of the tenants who have
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
come through their program in their
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
homes so it's been a really successful
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
program and um
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
what the honorable judge king has found
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of times
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
the court doesn't have an opportunity to
 
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.670 align:start position:0%
the court doesn't have an opportunity to
simply

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
give air to to the
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
issues that have arisen between the
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
landlord and tenant pursuant to formal
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
procedure so this mediation program is
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
given a chance for
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
the parties primarily to do the work to
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
sort of you know work out these issues
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
between them um in a formal setting and
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
and in that way
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
allows the court to actively support
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
them you know resolving these disputes
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
in in a new way that's not as
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
procedurally stringent so
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
um i guess those are the highlights to
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
me um but i think you know making sure
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the general court kind of takes a
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
look at this model and
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
um you know potentially considers how it
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
can further be expanded in the future
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
would be a smart use of taxpayer money
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
and a great way to avoid
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
formal litigation where we could be
 
00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.070 align:start position:0%
formal litigation where we could be
supporting

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.950 align:start position:0%
supporting
um

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
more resolution of these disputes
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the court and also
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
accomplishing our important goal of
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
making sure people stay in their homes
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
so they can focus on their families and
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
their jobs and and being a part of our
 
00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:08.950 align:start position:0%
their jobs and and being a part of our
society

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um i'm just
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
looking at real quick through your
 
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.990 align:start position:0%
looking at real quick through your
report

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
but seeing this is a pilot program and
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking to make it a commission to
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
study when is the pilot program going to
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
end and do you foresee some issues
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
between that and hopefully getting the
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
study up and running yeah um
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
i am going to defer the question on when
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
it ends i believe it is uh later this
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
spring that it will come to an end but
 
00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:42.230 align:start position:0%
spring that it will come to an end but
um

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's part of why we thought the
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
commission would be well timed because
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
it would give an opportunity for
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders you know such as new
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire legal assistance and new
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing just to be a part of
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
the conversation on this program and
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's the best it can be
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
other questions i see representative
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you senator
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
if the pilot program has been success so
 
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.950 align:start position:0%
if the pilot program has been success so
successful

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
why haven't you come to us with
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to make it permanent rather
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
than to
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
set up a commission
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
representative and um and i'll let mr
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
head speak to this further but um we did
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative delorenzo and i did ask
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
if that would be a helpful way to
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
support the program and
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
given that the pilot had not even yet
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
come to conclusion
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
the judge's office felt that it would be
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
better to give the pilot program a
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
chance to run its course
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
but i felt that
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
having a commission to make sure we as
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
the general courts supported the program
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
might be a good way to then come back
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
next year perhaps with a request for
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation to make it permanent
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
again thank you for your testimony all
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and the chair did
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
not say but i did sign up in support of
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the judicial branch does support the
 
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.789 align:start position:0%
and the judicial branch does support the
bill

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:41.510 align:start position:0%
bill
the

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
i just wanted
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
also i'm apologizing on behalf of
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
margaret huang who does all of our
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
coordination she had a conflict this
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
morning so if i cannot answer a question
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to get an answer for you
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
this program originally started in two
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
courts as a pilot
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
with existing funds that we have out of
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
our mediation budget
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
as a result of the availability of
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
federal funds through
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
covet relief money we were able to
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
expand the program so that it currently
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
has two
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
separate parts to it one is a pre-filing
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
program to encourage a resolution prior
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
to any filing of any litigation in court
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
and the parties either any party
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
involved can reach out to uh to the
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
court we can uh we do a sort of an
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
intake process if there are resources
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
that we're aware of that can be of
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
assistance to the parties we make the
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
parties aware of those resources and
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
then we try to resolve any disputes
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
prior to uh prior to any litigation
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
being filed
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
with the data that we have that has uh
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the fairly small window of time that
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
i have data here november of 2021
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
through february of 2022
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
that had about a 68
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
success rate on reaching agreement and
 
00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:08.149 align:start position:0%
success rate on reaching agreement and
pre-litigation

00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
pre-litigation
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
um uh matters
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then we have a separate program
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
in in the pre litigation is statewide
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
you can do that anywhere in the state
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
the the smaller program we have is uh
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
is post litigation so when it's actually
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
now been filed in the circuit court in
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
concord nashua in manchester we're
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
running a separate program
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
where all of the parties are offered
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
mediation essentially on the day that
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
they would have their scheduled hearing
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
so when they're at court for their
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
hearing they're given the opportunity to
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
be redirected into a mediation
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and try to resolve that short of
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
appearing in front of the judge that has
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
the advantage of the for the parties of
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
letting them be in control of what the
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
decision is it does not always result in
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
a tenant staying in the apartment but it
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
may result in a process by which the
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
tenant will leave the apartment as
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to having a date certain it
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
avoids the uncertainty of going to a
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
judge and making a judge decide on the
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
matter and it gives the the really the
 
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.230 align:start position:0%
matter and it gives the the really the
decision-making

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
decision-making
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
over the case that authority over to the
 
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.590 align:start position:0%
over the case that authority over to the
parties

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen again in a
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
relatively small window
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
about an 81
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
agreement rate on those types of cases
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
so a very successful mediation program
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
in that sense
 
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.070 align:start position:0%
in that sense
but

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly small
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
group of cases so far so
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
relatively new program
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
because we're able to do it through arpa
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
money we do have
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
additional time so we're hoping to
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
extend this program through the year
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
what i think the study commission would
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
do would give an opportunity for us both
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
to provide information to the
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
legislative body because if you do want
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
to extend this program it would be a
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
budget item next year so one it's an
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sort of educate the
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislative body on the program it's
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
received national attention it is a very
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
positive program
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
but if we're asking for money it's a
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
useful thing to to provide information
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's also useful to the judicial branch
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
because we can always improve things so
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
if there's testimonial there's a process
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
by which we would receive information
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
about how we can improve the program
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're always interested in that always
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
also so i think it does have a benefit
 
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.350 align:start position:0%
also so i think it does have a benefit
it's

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
we're not in a budget year so we're not
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
asking for for the budgeting items this
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
year but we think we have federal funds
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
available sufficient to carry us through
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.669 align:start position:0%
the year
um

00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
so the so you know that would provide
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
the the overall benefit and with that i
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
think i'll
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and be happy to
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
attorney head for taking my question
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity because this is a
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
pilot program and i'm looking at where
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
the filing
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
was it conquered manchester nashua
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's the only area so if you lived in
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
portsmouth you wouldn't be able to use
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
this program right now that's right so
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
what um what we do is we're paying the
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
mediators out of our out of the federal
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
funds or out of our mediation budget so
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
the parties don't pay for it but because
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
those are in the courtroom they're
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
physically there you know it's a limited
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
amount of funds available
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're able to do the pre-litigation one
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
statewide because those are done
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
remotely either video or telephone
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
so you know in that process we're able
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
to offer it more broadly but because
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
these are physically done in the
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
courtrooms or in the courthouses it's a
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
more limited program
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then we pay for the the cost of the
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
mediators out of out of our program
 
00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:51.350 align:start position:0%
mediators out of out of our program
money

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative chase you want to follow
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is just where i just want
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
to understand all of this where the
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
courts are being heard but if say you
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
lived in portsmouth or my hometown
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
rollinsford and i had an issue i would
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
be able to file and go to one of these
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
courts that this is happening in no you
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
the what would be available would be the
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
pre-litigation so the parties who are
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
not yet filed lawsuits if if your normal
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
place to file a lawsuit would be
 
00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:22.710 align:start position:0%
place to file a lawsuit would be
portsmouth

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
this program is not available in the
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
courthouse there
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
but anybody who would be able to reach
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
out call the the telephone number that's
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
on our website before litigation
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
and try to do a essentially a remote
 
00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
and try to do a essentially a remote
mediation

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i do just
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
so it sort of gets back to what
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative smith asked and you've
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
given us all the reasons why the program
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
is working and why it's successful and
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
how it benefits both tenants and
 
00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:57.750 align:start position:0%
how it benefits both tenants and
landlords

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
the question i guess is
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
do we
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
what is ultimately the purpose of the
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
commission if it's
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
is it more than showing that the program
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
is successful i think
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think the
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
the benefit would be that as
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
we are developing this program because
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
it is a new program i think the
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
legislative body does provide sort of
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
unique form for
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
ways in which it can be improved so it
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
does allow the public an opportunity to
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
come and speak to the program where they
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
may not give us feedback in the same way
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
gives legislators an opportunity to give
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
us feedback
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
so that the program itself may be
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
modified through this process from what
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing currently
 
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
we're doing currently
so

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
you know but certainly i think the the
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
goal is to have
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
provide information about the program
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
but also receive information about what
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
do we do well what can we do better and
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
what are the
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
what are the sort of the
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
what other input can we get that we
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
might not otherwise receive
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
and if i could
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
ask a second question and
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
i was just in another hearing prior to
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
us meeting this morning we're talking to
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
representatives from the court who
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
basically said we can't
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
accomplish everything that we currently
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the resources or the
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
ability to do that
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
is it under those circumstances do you
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
think it's advisable to take on a an
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
additional or a new program
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question i think
 
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.310 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question i think
the

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
there are definitely resource issues we
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
have staffing issues in all of the
 
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.870 align:start position:0%
have staffing issues in all of the
courthouses

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
courthouses
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
we are currently down two full-time
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
judges in terms of of having folks who
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
have retired but not been replaced we
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
have a marital master who is about to
 
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.070 align:start position:0%
have a marital master who is about to
retire

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
retire
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
and has not been replaced we have
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
definite shortages in the circuit court
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
system and that does result in delays
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
the benefit of this program is one it's
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
operated and managed out of our
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution program
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
not by the court clerks
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
it is uh managed with mediators as
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to judges or court staff so we
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
have third party mediators who are
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
filling that role
 
00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:22.789 align:start position:0%
filling that role
and

00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day it takes
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
a certain number of cases out of the
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
system if they're able to be resolved
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
pre-filing which is ideal
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
it never enters the court system or if
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's entered the court system
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
it at least does not result
 
00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:41.350 align:start position:0%
it at least does not result
in

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
a hearing
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
relatively and and and this is you know
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
obviously part of the discussion
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
once you're in a
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
filing has occurred
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
and we're on hearing day
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know court staff has become involved
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
the judge has become involved in a set
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
aside time for that hearing so there is
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
an impact maybe there are ways of
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
improving that but at least the
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
mediation itself is done by
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
third party paid
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
mediators and at least some of the
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
coordination is done through a different
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
program within the court so it's not
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
impacting the same resources
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
so i think there is
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
probably some room for improvement and
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
the other way thing that we can try to
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
figure out is are there
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
are there other ways that we can
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
encourage the pre-litigation mediation
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
process and expand that
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
so that it never enters the court where
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
we can avoid it
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
chase thank you thank you again um i
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up with my
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
question earlier about when the pilot
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
program is going to end and what's the
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
overlap going to be you know i have to
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
get a better answer for that i think
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's through the year but i i'll find
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
out for margaret and
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
send an email to the committee
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
sing then thank you for your testimony
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo i see you put a
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
card in
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
i and i see you're a co-sponsor you've
 
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.389 align:start position:0%
i and i see you're a co-sponsor you've
already

00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
sat as a member of the committee and
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
um tip which typically you wouldn't do

um
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
particularly in suffolk county
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts which would be boston and
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
boston housing court
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the boston housing court
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
mediation was offered to landlords and
 
00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:36.470 align:start position:0%
mediation was offered to landlords and
tenants

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
tenants
and

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
the mediation happened after
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
the case was um filed after after was
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
entered into the system um
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
on the day of the hearing the judge
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
would off you know the judge would um
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
ask if folks wanted to talk with the
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
housing specialist who was a mediator
 
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.269 align:start position:0%
housing specialist who was a mediator
and

00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
i did a lot of those cases for
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent and typically what
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
would happen is that
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
let's say a person owes i don't know 500
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
um rent and maybe it's a month and a
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
half no three months rent
 
00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:12.870 align:start position:0%
half no three months rent
um

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
what would happen is that we would come
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
up with a payment plan
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the landlord would sign it the
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
tenant would sign it and
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
once the
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
payment agreement was
 
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.789 align:start position:0%
payment agreement was
fulfilled

00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
fulfilled
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
the tenancy could be restored to full
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
tennessee but i found that it was really
 
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.710 align:start position:0%
tennessee but i found that it was really
helpful

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
helpful
um

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
it was a conciliatory process rather
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
than a punitive process
 
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.789 align:start position:0%
than a punitive process
and

00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to let folks know about
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
landlord it was wonderful

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch i have a partly
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
filled up pink card i will complete the
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
filling out of that pink card we didn't
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
was not planning on testifying but
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
generally we would support obviously
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
senator carson's bill
 
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
senator carson's bill
the

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
the issue is very complicated because
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:15.990 align:start position:0%
the the
um

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
and so in my experience in private
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
practice was if you need out of state
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
testimony there's a fairly complicated
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
process currently in place it is
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
possible to do you can get
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
what's called a commissioner appointed
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
you have to go to the local court you
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
have to get an order from your local
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
court you then have to take that order
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
go to the foreign jurisdiction so if
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
it's in ohio i have to bring that to
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
ohio i then have to do stuff according
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
to ohio law to get somebody in ohio
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh to get in order to have to get an
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
order in ohio probably usually
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then i have to
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh get somebody to make service and
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly complicated process and it
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then i have to go to ohio i take the
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
deposition and and come back
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
what this there is a a uniform act and
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
in fact new hampshire has
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
partially passed the uniform act in that
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
if somebody from another state who has
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
passed the uniform act is trying to get
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
discovery in new hampshire
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
they can do that according to the
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
uniform act and basically just says
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead and get your discovery as you
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
would in new hampshire and you don't
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
have to do anything special it would
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
allow a new hampshire party to have that
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
same benefit when traveling or when
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
needing discovery from somebody out of
 
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.109 align:start position:0%
needing discovery from somebody out of
state

00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
and it simply provides new hampshire
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
lawyers and new hampshire parties the
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
same opportunities that currently folks
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
in other states have when they're trying
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
to seek
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
discovery in new hampshire so it does
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
make for a smoother process it does also
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate a step with seeking an order
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
from a new hampshire court so a benefit
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
there for us
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
so overall it just makes for a much
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
smoother process and it only applies
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
where the other state has also adopted
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
the uniform
 
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.390 align:start position:0%
the uniform
act

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
i would that be happy to conclude my
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:19.829 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
chase

00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
chase
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer so bear with me
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
is it for say if you wanted to um
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
get information from
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
a company or is it from a certain person
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
is it something that may be
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
a crime that had happened here and then
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
the person lives in a different country
 
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.549 align:start position:0%
the person lives in a different country
um

00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
state and you need to get their
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
testimony i'm just trying to figure
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's i understand it but i want to see
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
where it fits so it fits in a lot of
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
different circumstances so
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
in in the context of civil litigation
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
there are people who may have facts or
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
may have documents who are not residing
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and a subpoena from a
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire court has authority within
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire so a new
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire judge cannot order somebody
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
who lives in ohio to appear
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
in that that that's where the rub occurs
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
we just have limited jurisdiction our
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
authority to issue subpoenas
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
so anytime there is somebody who has
 
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.390 align:start position:0%
so anytime there is somebody who has
either

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
physical evidence that's outside of new
 
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.190 align:start position:0%
physical evidence that's outside of new
hampshire

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
or testimonial evidence that's outside
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
the question is how do you get that into
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and into the case that's
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we still can't
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
physically make them come to new
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire but it is an easier process if
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
it's testimony we can take videotape
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
testimony if it's documentary
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
typically what is done is
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
a party that holds a document you would
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
schedule a deposition but say if you get
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
us the documents ahead of time you don't
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
need to appear
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it just makes for a much
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
smoother process when you're dealing
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
that being said thank you very much for
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you thank you very
 
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.069 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you thank you very
much

00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that wishes to
 
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:41.109 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that wishes to
speak

00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
so the committee recognizes neil
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
nickerson nicholson nicholson yes thank
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
you very much good morning everyone so
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
nice to be here with you this morning my
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
name is neil nicholson i am a an
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
attorney that practices here in concord
 
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
at the law firm nicholson law firm i
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
practice mostly civil litigation and i
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
am testifying in support of this bill i
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
am also the past president of the new
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire association for justice
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief i thought attorney
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
ahead did a very nice job summarizing
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and i'm going to synchronize
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
it maybe even a little bit further
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
the reason why
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill is number
 
00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.069 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill is number
one

00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
it improves judicial efficiency
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
so by passing this bill
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
we will no longer have the need to file
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
a motion in new hampshire superior court
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
in order to get approval
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
to have another lawyer from another
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
state act as a commissioner
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
to take testimony or to otherwise gather
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
evidence in that foreign state so we
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
file a motion that's going to take time
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
and resources away from the judicial
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
staff and a judge in order to rule on
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
that motion which i will tell you most
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the time are assented to emotions so
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
there are situations where the attorneys
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
on both sides agree that this process
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
needs to go through
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is just kind of an antiquated
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
process that we're still operating under
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
the second reason why um testifying and
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
support of this bill is that it it will
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually increase the speed by which
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
people involved in litigation will be
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
able to get access to evidence so the
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
case will proceed in a faster fashion
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
which is always a good thing
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
rather than having unnecessary delay
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
which is what we have to deal with under
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
the current structure
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
thirdly and and i would say most
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
importantly is
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
by passing this bill it's actually going
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
to reduce
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
costs uh and attorneys fees
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
for people that are involved in
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
litigation so no longer will a person
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
who is a party in litigation have to pay
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
for an attorney
 
00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.990 align:start position:0%
for an attorney
me

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
to go to that state wherever it is we're
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
trying to find a witness or evidence and
 
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.670 align:start position:0%
trying to find a witness or evidence and
find

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
an attorney in that state who's licensed
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
in that state who would be willing to
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
act as the commissioner
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then spend time and money on me to
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
file the motion in court get it approved
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
hire the lawyer in the foreign
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in order to act as the
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner so it would actually end up
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh saving litigants
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
money in attorney's fees which is you
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
know good good for them and good for all
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
of us so those are the reasons why i
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
support this bill i'm happy to take any
 
00:52:31.119 --> 00:52:34.790 align:start position:0%
support this bill i'm happy to take any
questions

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
does anybody in the community have any
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
much i don't have any other pink cards
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%

good morning i'm margaret burns i'm the
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
municipal association
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
we do not have a position on senate bill
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
301 we worked with the senate judiciary
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
committee to make some changes to the
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill just to
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
clarify a few things i have just one
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
very small comment on the current
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
version of the bill and that is in line
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
three as well as in line six
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
the bill refers to government government
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
records or information requests and then
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
in line six uh talks about the
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
production of government records or
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
information my very small comment is
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
just that under rsa 91 section 1a the
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
definition section
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
records are a
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
sub i'm sorry information is a sub
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
definition of government records so it
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
is really unnecessary to state both
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
pieces because government records will
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
contain information and all other
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
documentation in an ascertainable format
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a all-encompassing
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
definition so that is one very small
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
comment for the committee's
 
01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
comment for the committee's
consideration

01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
i have no other comments but i'm happy
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
to try to take any questions if there
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
are any
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
questions for mrs burns yes
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
question would you just make it clear to
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
me what what are you saying take out
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
government records or information take
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
out information information and leave
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
the government records that's correct
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:17:31.199 --> 01:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
can

01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
you tell me why you are not taking a
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
position on this absolutely the way that
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
we read the bill it's putting sort of
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
guard rails and parameters around the
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
process and in doing so it probably will
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
benefit both plaintiffs and governmental
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
entities that are involved in lawsuits
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
related to governmental record issues i
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
spoke with some municipal attorneys as
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
well to sort of get their input and see
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
if i was reading that correctly and they
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
agreed that having parameters around the
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
process could actually benefit both
 
01:18:04.239 --> 01:18:05.910 align:start position:0%
process could actually benefit both
sides

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
sides
 
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.030 align:start position:0%
sides
and

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.229 align:start position:0%
and
therefore

01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm sorry
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
so can you tell me why you are not
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
taking a position why you are not
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
supporting this
 
01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.030 align:start position:0%
supporting this
um

01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're neutral on it because it doesn't
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
specifically fall under any of our
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
member adopted policies it doesn't
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
create new authority it doesn't erode
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
current local authority or specifically
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
fall under any of our member adopted
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
policies and in those circumstances we
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
are generally neutral on bills when that
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
thank you this is not the time to follow
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
up on that
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.990 align:start position:0%

laureato

01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
good morning lori ordolano nashua i'm
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
representing right to know new hampshire
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
i spoke to this bill when it was
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
introduced over in the senate and right
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
to know new hampshire took a position
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
against this bill at the time the way
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
the language was written it included
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
submitting all responsive documents that
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
were provided
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
um to um
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
the um
respondent

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
respondent
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
and in some instances there's a lot of
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
documentation given that
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
did not need to be included in a lawsuit
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
for example i had a request for
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
information that i thought looks like
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's been amended and some of the
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
language has been changed
 
01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:45.350 align:start position:0%
language has been changed
um

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
our group took a position against this
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
because we were
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
more interested and strongly supported
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
the ombudsman bill that is moved out of
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
the house and is over at the senate and
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
has been a work in progress for four or
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
we felt that that position and the
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
handling of right to knows um in that
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
manner was sort of where we put our eggs
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
into that basket
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
the this change in the language you know
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns right you know new
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire had is it really doesn't
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
address it it addresses records issues
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
but not meetings rsa covers two types of
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
91a covers two types of issues document
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
requests that are not satisfied and
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
meetings that are not held correctly and
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
so this language seemed to speak to the
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
document issue and not really the
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
meetings issue so we didn't believe it
 
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:36.950 align:start position:0%
meetings issue so we didn't believe it
was

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
and honestly i believe this legislation
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
was drawn up because of things that were
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
happening down in nashua in my city um
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
there was you know some folks that
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to try and assist with what was
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
going on down there but i'm always
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
hesitant to create legislation because
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
of maybe the bad practices of one
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
municipality and transfer that through
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that has to apply to the
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
whole state so i'm really cautious about
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
doing that and making certain when we do
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
so so that's been our concern with it um
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
i just heard the lady before mention
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
that they would strike information for
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
the production of governmental records
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
or information because a lawsuit filed
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
under 91a would be a governmental
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
records suit but there is an
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
informational component to it that i'd
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know like to call out just for
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
awareness when there are exemptions
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
applied in your denied records under
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions the municipality is supposed
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
to provide a brief explanation of why
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
how that exemption applies and so that
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
would be sort of an information response
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
that could prompt a lawsuit
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
and in fact it's been a problem i know
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
in my municipality where exemptions are
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
given but an explanation for that
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
exemption or how it applies is not given
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
and that has drawn me to court to try
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
and figure out why documents are not
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
provided so that isn't necessarily a
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
records issue it's an exemption issue
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
with a lack of information provided in
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
clarity so in that sense information
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
included when there's exemption
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
challenges coming forward
 
01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:25.430 align:start position:0%
challenges coming forward
so

01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know i guess
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
our position would be that maybe there's
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
a little more work in progress to go on
 
01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.350 align:start position:0%
a little more work in progress to go on
here

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.110 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that was discovered
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know i think the courts right now
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
are really struggling with right to know
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
issues the pandemic had an impact impact
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
the priority nature of getting your
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
right to knows through
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
because they're supposed to be priority
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
matters has not really happened because
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
the courts are backlogged so
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
understandably so but the other thing
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's been going on is that
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
i found there was an administrative
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
order passed in 2013 called
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
ao213-08 which calls out exemptions to
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
certain types of civil matters to be
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
exempt from trial rules and right to
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
know falls in that category it is exempt
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
from trial rules and there's a list of
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
rules that don't apply like answers to a
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
lawsuit don't apply
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
interrogatories discovery that doesn't
 
01:23:26.639 --> 01:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
interrogatories discovery that doesn't
apply

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
the judge can order it to apply but
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
ordinarily a right to know case would be
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
heard on a merits hearing
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
and i think the courts
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
to some extent have some of them have
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
forgotten that they're pushing a lot of
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
these right-to-know challenges to
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
full-blown lawsuits and they don't need
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
it happened to me i just finished two
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
pro se cases they were full-blown lot
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits i mean they were full-blown
 
01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.510 align:start position:0%
lawsuits i mean they were full-blown
trials

01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
trials
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
discovery depositions everything
 
01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.590 align:start position:0%
discovery depositions everything
um

01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
and they could have been a merit hearing
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
which would have been much cheaper
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
and less time for everyone to go through
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
the reason i took them on myself is
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
because i knew they were gonna each one
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
would have cost me 25 000 to go into
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
court and i didn't want to spend that i
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
won the first one 99 certain i won the
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
second one
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm feeling pretty good about where i
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
stand on those but it was a lot of work
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
it was very stressful it's incredibly
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
difficult so i think trying to make the
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
courts and help the courts understand
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
and refresh their memories on
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
administrative order 213-08 is important
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can try and keep these things
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
as merit hearings minimize the impact on
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
the court the fees to the
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
the filer
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.709 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
questions
um

01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for taking my
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
question so is it right-to-knows
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
position then
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
that they think that the structure put
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
forth in this bill
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
um is too restrictive maybe pushing
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
people into a trial when it could be a
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
merit hearing and that maybe the
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
ombudsman is just the better approach to
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
allow more flexibility
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get a feel for where
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of going yes i think
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's a fair assessment we do think the
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
ombudsman is where we'd like to you know
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
focus our energies and our our um you
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
know time in that area and auditing that
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
should it take place and making certain
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's working the way we want it to work
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
and modifying it so that is definitely
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
where we want to go and we do feel this
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
is restrictive because it doesn't pick
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
up meetings
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we think that reminding the courts
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the uh you know when they go into
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
superior court to be heard as a civil
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
matter to try and focus them as merit
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
hearings and not full trials
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
represent mclean follow up thank you mr
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
chair just a quick follow-up so then
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
even if we were to amend this
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to incorporate meetings
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
you your position would still be one of
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
wanting to go the ombudsman route
 
01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.990 align:start position:0%
wanting to go the ombudsman route
yes

01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you represent mclean for asking
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr delano
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will
 
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
declare the hearing closed
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%

01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
i thought we'd be running a tight
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%

okay

01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.679 --> 01:41:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:52.470 align:start position:0%
this bill
is

01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the licensing boards of
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.270 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
certification

01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
and we know that there are the 54
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
licensing boards
 
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.750 align:start position:0%
licensing boards
that

01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:09.510 align:start position:0%
that
they

01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
i began this conversation with
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
director lindsey courtney
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
because over the summer of 21
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
there were experiencing
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.629 align:start position:0%
 
professions

01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
professions
 
01:43:34.639 --> 01:43:37.189 align:start position:0%
professions
and

01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.199 --> 01:43:38.629 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
entered a conversation how can we
 
01:43:41.199 --> 01:43:42.790 align:start position:0%
entered a conversation how can we
accelerate

01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
accelerate
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh this pipeline problem
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
and she described to me that they were
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
having difficulty achieving a quorum for
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully we are getting out of a
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we
 
01:44:04.709 --> 01:44:04.719 align:start position:0%
don't face this but
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
as much but the fact still remains we
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
want to have as diverse a representation
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
on our licensing boards as possible
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
and diversity in our state often is
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
defined by regional diversity across our
 
01:44:21.679 --> 01:44:23.189 align:start position:0%
defined by regional diversity across our
state

01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
often licensing boards have 90-minute
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
meetings and people are driving
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
two to three hours
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
to those meetings
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
returning home in the same amount of
 
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:37.669 align:start position:0%
returning home in the same amount of
time

01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
for a 90-minute meeting
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
and when we're talking about
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
folks that
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
are reimbursed a per client
 
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.470 align:start position:0%
are reimbursed a per client
were

01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
digging into
 
01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
digging into
the

01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
earnings of
 
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
people that were asking to be active in
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
their profession
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
serve the profession on these licensing
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
boards so that's what this bill is aimed
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
very specific
 
01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.669 align:start position:0%
very specific
to

01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
as to where it's placed it's placed in
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
rsa 310
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't need to be
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
put into every one of the licensing
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
professions but that
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
it would allow
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
each of the commissions to establish
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
rules that would allow it to hold
 
01:45:31.679 --> 01:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
rules that would allow it to hold
meetings

01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:33.750 align:start position:0%
meetings
uh

01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
electronically and other
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
providing alternative communication
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities for members of their
 
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.790 align:start position:0%
opportunities for members of their
commission

01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
and that's the nature of the the bill i
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
believe there's somebody here from oplc
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh to speak to this
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
they can give you more
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
details about which commissions uh
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
they've had the difficulties with
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
over the last year
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
well maybe he'll
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
defer this for when the abrupt oplc
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
comes but
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
what exactly happens at these 19-minute
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
they will review
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
licensing candidates but they also will
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
review people who have licenses and
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
have disciplinary
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions about those licenses
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
they also modify their standards for
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
licensing and rules that need to be
 
01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.950 align:start position:0%
licensing and rules that need to be
established

01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up is this
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
so would these meetings are fair to say
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
typically of a large percentage of the
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
time spent in executive session if
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
they're discussing specific candidates
 
01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.070 align:start position:0%
they're discussing specific candidates
or

01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:56.790 align:start position:0%
or
or

01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do yes yeah right yeah
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i've i i say this when i was doing
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
legislation on
 
01:47:04.239 --> 01:47:05.750 align:start position:0%
legislation on
uh

01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools or telehealth
 
01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:09.510 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools or telehealth
i

01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
i
joined

01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
joined
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
the director of the department to meet
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
with some of the commissions that would
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
be affected by that legislation so
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
insight i haven't attended tried to
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
i guess if i had a question
 
01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.030 align:start position:0%
i guess if i had a question
it's

01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
we've gotten
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
a number of bills having to do with
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
remote meetings over the last
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
year or two
 
01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.109 align:start position:0%
year or two
and

01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:43.119 --> 01:47:43.910 align:start position:0%
and
it

01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't seem like we had
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
this type of issue
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
prior to the covered issues so
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
i guess the question i have is
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
is this a this is uh do you view this as
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
a covert related problem
 
01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.709 align:start position:0%
a covert related problem
or

01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
and if if it isn't a covid related
 
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.109 align:start position:0%
and if if it isn't a covid related
problem

01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
why is it now a problem when it doesn't
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's a great question to ask i i think
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
this has been a problem in the past
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
because of the distance
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
factor and the professional time
 
01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.990 align:start position:0%
factor and the professional time
lost

01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
more trying for people to
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
want to be at in-person meetings
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
but i think that this has been a problem
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the question is can we keep
 
01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.950 align:start position:0%
and the question is can we keep
active

01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
active
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
on boards when there's this significant
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
time trade-off
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how well i'm going to do
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
this but is it
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
so good morning
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
my name is jessica calipalis i am the
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
director for the division of enforcement
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
at the office of professional licensure
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
and certification and i am here on
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
behalf of oplc this morning
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
um just very briefly um
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
oplc does not take a position on this
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation um however the
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
agency would note that there are no
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
number of boards that we support
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
that have been having physical quorum
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
issues as senator khan had indicated um
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
since they've had to come back in person
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
since the emergency orders ended
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
allowing them remote participation
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
executive director lindsey courtney also
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
provided a letter
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
which included a excel spreadsheet which
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
indicated which boards are having
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
issues and to what extent
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
so i would point that out to the
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
committee if you have not seen that yet
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
i think that's that provides a great
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
deal of information that you might find
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.199 --> 01:50:36.550 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
again if i could just say
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
it and i sit on a board
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
and when i accepted
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
the appointment to be on that board i
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
accepted it with the understanding that
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
i had to go to a monthly meeting
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't that be an ordinary
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
expectation for someone sitting on a
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
board that a requirement of being on the
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
board is you're going to attend a
 
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
board is you're going to attend a
meeting

01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
um i don't have a great answer for i
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
haven't pulled all the different boards
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
that are having issues i have heard from
 
01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.430 align:start position:0%
that are having issues i have heard from
one

01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of a board in particular
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
that is in the medical field and those
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
folks some of them are still treating
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
covid patients
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
so they have concerns about potentially
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
being exposed and bringing that exposure
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
to a meeting in person or they
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
themselves have may not be treating
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
some type of autoimmune disorder or a
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
family member does and they are
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about being exposed
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
so to some extent covet is still an
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
issue for those folks but i don't know
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
that that applies to all the boards
 
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
having this issue
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't know why perhaps it was not
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
an issue in the past and is a larger
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
laurie ordellano 41 berkeley street i'm
 
01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.669 align:start position:0%
laurie ordellano 41 berkeley street i'm
representing

01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
right to know new hampshire our position
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
on these bills looking to
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
create remote meetings for boards has
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
been to oppose them
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
primarily because we feel a physical
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
location is very important for any of
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
these appointed or elected boards
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
we would be supportive of
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
relaxing the quorum requirement
 
01:52:40.639 --> 01:52:41.750 align:start position:0%
relaxing the quorum requirement
or

01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
revisiting the quorum requirement
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
particularly for
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
boards that have struggled i don't have
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
the data my question was going to be
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
what is you know let's look at the data
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
the oplc has 53 different boards and
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's one that's on the table to be
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
added that i'm interested in which is
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
moving the certification of assessors
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
and discipline over to the oplc that's
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's a bill right now moving forward
 
01:53:07.119 --> 01:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
that's a bill right now moving forward
so

01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.109 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to see how many of
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
those boards had a quorum issue
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
and if we need to make an accommodation
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
with that quorum for those boards then
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps that should be looked at first i
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
really feel a physical location is very
 
01:53:23.199 --> 01:53:24.550 align:start position:0%
really feel a physical location is very
important

01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm particularly concerned
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
if the only means of dial-in is through
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
a telephone versus zoom
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think the um being able to physically
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
see people
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
and have a physical location where you
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
can address people talk to them before
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
after a meeting
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
express any other concerns you might
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
have if there is no public participation
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
is really very important and very
 
01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.470 align:start position:0%
is really very important and very
valuable

01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.589 align:start position:0%
valuable
um

01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
i hate to see that given up
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
my sense was pre pandemic that a lot of
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
this wasn't nearly the issue it was
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
over the last two years and that we're
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
putting this behind us
 
01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.149 align:start position:0%
putting this behind us
now

01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
and we should try to establish
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
business as usual as much as we possibly
 
01:54:09.599 --> 01:54:10.470 align:start position:0%
business as usual as much as we possibly
can

01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.270 align:start position:0%
can
so

01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
we would like to see a physical location
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
maintained for these meetings
 
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.109 align:start position:0%
maintained for these meetings
and

01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
have our representative people available
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
to us where we can go and the other
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
with a physical location if different
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
boards through oplc are centered at
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
having people perhaps come to concord
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
there might be a better chance
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
that if the quorum's relaxed you would
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
have a zoom feed
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
a video feed where
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
anyone attending would be able to see
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
their appointed or elected represented
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
representatives performing their duties
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with oplc at all and
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
what they do
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
yes because i helped
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
create the bill to move
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
the certification of assessors and
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
discipline of assessors out from the dra
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
over to the oplc
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
last year and so i became more familiar
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
with their work and their boards that
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
are set up and we're looking now to set
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
up a seven person board
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
um to have
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh certification and discipline handled
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
through oplc
 
01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
so we would be an additional one moving
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
it to like 55 groups and there's a fee
 
01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:29.430 align:start position:0%
it to like 55 groups and there's a fee
structure

01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.550 align:start position:0%
structure
nominal

01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
nominal
 
01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.350 align:start position:0%
nominal
to

01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
be within that organization and um
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
so i have some familia they came in oplc
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
a representative came in and presented
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
to the assessing standards board
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
about their organization what they could
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
do if they took this on and and that's
 
01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:46.870 align:start position:0%
do if they took this on and and that's
why

01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
our subgroup of certification move
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
forward with this legislation through
 
01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:51.669 align:start position:0%
forward with this legislation through
that

01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:51.679 --> 01:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
that
agency

01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
the the reason i ask the question is
 
01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:57.830 align:start position:0%
the the reason i ask the question is
um

01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what role oplc
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
if any
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
attendance at
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
board meetings and
 
01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.189 align:start position:0%
board meetings and
because

01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
it seems like we have oplc now
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
with a much greater formality in the way
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
the boards are managed and handled
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to prior to oplc
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
and where we didn't necessarily hear
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
about the problems that we're hearing
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
about now with regard to attendance i'm
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
just wondering and then this is a
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
question probably better directed at
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
ms calipaletis
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:45.109 align:start position:0%
do you think
that

01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:45.119 --> 01:56:46.229 align:start position:0%
that
this

01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
oplc and the formalities of oplc and
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
the more requirements created by oplc
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
might have some role in
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
people's unwillingness to attend
 
01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.149 align:start position:0%
people's unwillingness to attend
um

01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not necessarily certain of that i
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know i look at the assessing
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
standard board as an organization and
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
they take in um they're a
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
13 member board or 16 some directly from
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
the dra they meet in concord but they
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
have representation from all over the
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
state assessors or
 
01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:22.830 align:start position:0%
state assessors or
um

01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh select person managers come in from
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
all over to come to these meetings so
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a commitment and it's a
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
challenge to come but they always meet
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
one monthly and there is audience
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
attendance there's usually four or five
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
people that show up other assessors
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
other locations that come
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
speak they have a public comment
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
participate and give you know general
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
information as they're discussing
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
discussing topics and i think you know
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
if you took that group and you said hey
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
we'll just go remote with telephonic
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
meetings it would be an entirely
 
01:57:58.639 --> 01:57:59.589 align:start position:0%
meetings it would be an entirely
different

01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
meeting format
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i think what you'd get from the
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
is there anything else anyone else who
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will close the hearing
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 222.
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
and we will be in recess our next
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:47.349 --> 03:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:47.359 --> 03:42:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:42:48.550 --> 03:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
we'll call the house judiciary committee
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
back to order
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
and our next item of business today is a
 
03:42:57.670 --> 03:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
hearing it's a hearing on senate bill
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
392 establishing a commission to study
 
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
insanity and restoration of competency
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
the primary
 
03:43:07.910 --> 03:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill is senator sherman
 
03:43:10.710 --> 03:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
and i see that he's here senator sherman
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair and for the record my name is
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
senator tom sherman district 24
 
03:43:30.150 --> 03:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
representing 11 towns on the seacoast
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
which has had an interesting journey
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's establishing commission to study
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
insanity and restoration of competency
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative cushing was on this
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
commission on this council
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's advisory council on
 
03:43:59.830 --> 03:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
mental health and the corrections system
 
03:44:01.349 --> 03:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
areas that we
 
03:44:07.269 --> 03:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
identified as a as a council of concern
 
03:44:09.590 --> 03:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
is restoration and there are people far
 
03:44:11.830 --> 03:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
more qualified than me to explain
 
03:44:11.840 --> 03:44:13.990 align:start position:0%
more qualified than me to explain
restoration

03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
restoration
 
03:44:15.910 --> 03:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
but it's really critically important to
 
03:44:18.389 --> 03:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
protecting both the
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
accused and the victim
 
03:44:23.429 --> 03:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
um that people who have been declared in
 
03:44:23.439 --> 03:44:24.630 align:start position:0%
um that people who have been declared in
saying

03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:44:26.469 --> 03:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
go through a process of restoration so
 
03:44:28.830 --> 03:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
they can actually stand trial for their
 
03:44:31.349 --> 03:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
crime so that's
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
one part of this and i i will leave it
 
03:44:37.030 --> 03:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
to those who are far better than me to
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
the original bill simply
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh redefined insane
 
03:44:46.950 --> 03:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
and was a request of the department of
 
03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
the state statute on insanity has not
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
been amended since 1918
 
03:44:55.760 --> 03:44:57.269 align:start position:0%
been amended since 1918
so

03:44:57.269 --> 03:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
it currently
 
03:44:59.439 --> 03:45:01.750 align:start position:0%
it currently
reads

03:45:01.750 --> 03:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
reads
 
03:45:04.710 --> 03:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is amazing uh open quote the words
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
insane or insane person shall include
 
03:45:09.670 --> 03:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
every idiot
 
03:45:13.349 --> 03:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
non-compass that's c-o-m-p-o-s lunatic
 
03:45:17.189 --> 03:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
insane or distracted person close quote
 
03:45:19.269 --> 03:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's our current definition of
 
03:45:19.279 --> 03:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
that's our current definition of
insanity

03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
insanity
 
03:45:21.040 --> 03:45:22.790 align:start position:0%
insanity
in

03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:45:25.510 --> 03:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
statute and you know distracted person i
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
think that'd catch all of us certainly
 
03:45:29.910 --> 03:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
out on the roads these days
 
03:45:29.920 --> 03:45:31.269 align:start position:0%
out on the roads these days
um

03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
so clearly it does need revision but
 
03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
when we actually revised it and it was
 
03:45:39.910 --> 03:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh going to hearing on the senate side
 
03:45:43.189 --> 03:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
the doj the department of justice said
 
03:45:48.389 --> 03:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
wait stop we this will absolutely affect
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
cases that are currently in court
 
03:45:50.880 --> 03:45:52.229 align:start position:0%
cases that are currently in court
so

03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:55.030 --> 03:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we went to the idea of a
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
commission and because the two issues
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
are so closely related we brought in the
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
issue from the governor's advisory
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
council as well
 
03:46:04.080 --> 03:46:05.349 align:start position:0%
council as well
um

03:46:05.349 --> 03:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:08.150 --> 03:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
03:46:09.910 --> 03:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
there is a concern about more
 
03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:11.510 align:start position:0%
there is a concern about more
commissions

03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
i have two amendments and potentially
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
three depending on the will of this
 
03:46:23.120 --> 03:46:24.950 align:start position:0%
three depending on the will of this
committee

03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
that would turn this into an executive
 
03:46:30.070 --> 03:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
branch administrative working group
 
03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
that's a mouthful
 
03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
but we have done this really
 
03:46:34.239 --> 03:46:36.550 align:start position:0%
but we have done this really
successfully

03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
with the medicaid dental benefit that
 
03:46:41.910 --> 03:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
was probably the best recent example of
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
figuring out what the best answer is
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
bringing all the stakeholders together
 
03:46:47.189 --> 03:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
without having to have it in a
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
commission format
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
they're very effective nimble
 
03:46:54.150 --> 03:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
and as nimble as you can be with 17
 
03:46:56.309 --> 03:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
different members but
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
it really would be a viable alternative
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
to commissions to answer these two
 
03:47:01.439 --> 03:47:02.469 align:start position:0%
to commissions to answer these two
questions

03:47:02.469 --> 03:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
in a way that did not impact current
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
court cases and and also really
 
03:47:08.790 --> 03:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
benefited the state
 
03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:09.590 align:start position:0%
benefited the state
so

03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:09.600 --> 03:47:10.389 align:start position:0%
so
uh

03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
the main difference between these two
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
amendments all they're doing is taking
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
the bill the commission format turning
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
it into an executive branch
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
administrative working group
 
03:47:22.870 --> 03:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
and the only difference between the
 
03:47:22.880 --> 03:47:23.990 align:start position:0%
and the only difference between the
potentially

03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually i guess there could be four
 
03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
amendments is the number of people
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
participating on the house side
 
03:47:33.590 --> 03:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the original bill there were three
 
03:47:33.600 --> 03:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
uh in the original bill there were three
and

03:47:35.030 --> 03:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know it's completely up to you
 
03:47:39.269 --> 03:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
whether you want zero one two or three
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
um but these two amendments are in the
 
03:47:45.030 --> 03:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
form of three house which would be the
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
same as the current bill
 
03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
or zero house members and certainly
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
all you'd have to do is insert a one if
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
you want one house we would like to keep
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
our membership on the working group
 
03:48:00.610 --> 03:48:00.620 align:start position:0%
from the senate side so with that
 
03:48:00.620 --> 03:48:01.830 align:start position:0%
from the senate side so with that
[Music]

03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:48:04.950 --> 03:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
i can hand these out and answer any
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
03:48:09.760 --> 03:48:12.309 align:start position:0%
questions for the
senator

03:48:12.309 --> 03:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:14.309 --> 03:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
would it be okay if we put four senators
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.190 --> 03:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.200 --> 03:48:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:48:29.590 --> 03:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:33.510 --> 03:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the senator
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
i can leave these with you today that
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
would be great passed out
 
03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for considering this
 
03:48:49.189 --> 03:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
actually i understand that there are
 
03:48:52.319 --> 03:48:53.429 align:start position:0%
actually i understand that there are
three

03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
physicians who are here who would be
 
03:48:58.150 --> 03:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
testifying together dr samantha's
 
03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
sweater dr andrea mouchette from shay
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
and dr daniel

03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
as you heard from the senator before
 
03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
about the definition of insane and how
 
03:49:54.399 --> 03:49:55.750 align:start position:0%
about the definition of insane and how
it

03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
obviously needs to be changed and
 
03:49:57.359 --> 03:49:58.550 align:start position:0%
obviously needs to be changed and
updated

03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
updated
 
03:49:58.560 --> 03:50:01.189 align:start position:0%
updated

and we also with the construction of the
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
new forensic hospital and how this is
 
03:50:07.110 --> 03:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
like the best time
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
to review
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
the current sanity competency and
 
03:50:13.349 --> 03:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
restoration needs of new hampshire
 
03:50:14.950 --> 03:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they align with the
 
03:50:18.550 --> 03:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.950 --> 03:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
this executive work group seeks to
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
investigate this with collaboration with
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
our partners from doc doj as well as our
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
community stakeholders to establish an
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
executive work group
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
this large collaboration will allow all
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the voices of the stakeholders
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
to have a seat at the table to discuss
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
the needs of new hampshire and our
 
03:50:39.439 --> 03:50:40.389 align:start position:0%
the needs of new hampshire and our
clients

03:50:40.389 --> 03:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
clients
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:44.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't know if you had any specific
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
questions or clinical questions that we
 
03:50:53.590 --> 03:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:54.630 --> 03:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
are there
 
03:50:54.640 --> 03:50:57.830 align:start position:0%
are there
questions

03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative chase
 
03:51:01.590 --> 03:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:51:01.600 --> 03:51:02.389 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
so in other states um
 
03:51:08.309 --> 03:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
do we have a
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.469 --> 03:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
what the definition is
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
like i don't even want to say it because
 
03:51:19.110 --> 03:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's all so bad i'm sorry but is that
 
03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
what we're just trying to comply and and
 
03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
really bring things up i mean it's i
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
know i had read that before for
 
03:51:28.710 --> 03:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
something else and was just appalled
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
that it and then also that it had been
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
from the 1800s and nothing had ever been
 
03:51:34.150 --> 03:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
changed so
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh do are there examples or is that what
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do is just just get the
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
wording correct and and be able to
 
03:51:43.269 --> 03:51:43.279 align:start position:0%
establish what we know now from what we
 
03:51:47.189 --> 03:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
there are many examples across the
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
country with more updated language
 
03:51:52.229 --> 03:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit more respectful and
 
03:51:54.630 --> 03:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
then preserves the dignity of folks who
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
have been diagnosed with mental health
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
disorders in in the context of of their
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
involvement with the justice system um
 
03:52:03.510 --> 03:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
and that would be part of the the
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
working group's um
 
03:52:07.990 --> 03:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
scope is to kind of revisit some of
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
those other definitions and see what
 
03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.189 --> 03:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr shearer and thank you for
 
03:52:21.910 --> 03:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
some things have changed over the years
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
as far as mental health is concerned and
 
03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol misuse
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
disorder and
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
drug use misuse disorder
 
03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:40.630 align:start position:0%
drug use misuse disorder
have

03:52:40.630 --> 03:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:52:40.640 --> 03:52:43.670 align:start position:0%
have
been

03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
called disabilities
 
03:52:48.309 --> 03:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if
 
03:52:52.630 --> 03:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:52.640 --> 03:52:55.189 align:start position:0%
 
diseases

03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
related to um alcohol misuse and um
 
03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
drug misuse
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
if those entered the realm of insanity
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:10.710 --> 03:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question um and
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
something that's been struggled with
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
over the past many decades uh as long as
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
as we've been defining uh insanity um
 
03:53:18.560 --> 03:53:19.750 align:start position:0%
as we've been defining uh insanity um
legally

03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
legally
 
03:53:19.760 --> 03:53:20.630 align:start position:0%
legally
um

03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:23.429 --> 03:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
that's something that generally has been
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
or often been excluded
 
03:53:27.510 --> 03:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
from the definition of insanity but
 
03:53:28.950 --> 03:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
again that's something that this working
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
group would be coming together to
 
03:53:32.309 --> 03:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:53:37.110 --> 03:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative otter
 
03:53:42.630 --> 03:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
question um
 
03:53:44.399 --> 03:53:45.429 align:start position:0%
question um
i'm

03:53:45.429 --> 03:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
why i don't understand why we need a
 
03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
whole commission to just change a
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.990 --> 03:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's another excellent question
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
this started out as something that was
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
very simple which was to address a
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
definition and what came out of this
 
03:54:02.630 --> 03:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
process very quickly as we were
 
03:54:04.630 --> 03:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
collaborating with our other partners in
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
department of justice in particular but
 
03:54:08.550 --> 03:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
also the department of corrections was
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
that changing a simple definition is
 
03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
going to have ramifications
 
03:54:15.429 --> 03:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
elsewhere within the the systems and
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
that this also might represent an
 
03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to visit other forensic
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
issues and try to improve those systems
 
03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
across the board and that's why this
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
working group has been
 
03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:29.750 align:start position:0%
working group has been
proposed

03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:29.760 --> 03:54:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
other

03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:54:33.910 --> 03:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative macbeth
 
03:54:35.910 --> 03:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you so much
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:54:37.439 --> 03:54:38.550 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

03:54:38.550 --> 03:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:40.870 --> 03:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering um
 
03:54:40.880 --> 03:54:41.910 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering um
is

03:54:41.910 --> 03:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
like situational insanity versus maybe
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
longer term condition is would that be
 
03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:48.870 align:start position:0%
longer term condition is would that be
um

03:54:48.870 --> 03:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:51.510 --> 03:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
investigated or looked at by this
 
03:54:51.520 --> 03:54:53.590 align:start position:0%
investigated or looked at by this
commission

03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm thinking maybe of somebody
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
also that maybe be unmedicated versus
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
medicated or or um in some type of
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
trauma or
 
03:55:05.670 --> 03:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
crisis versus
 
03:55:05.680 --> 03:55:11.030 align:start position:0%
crisis versus
someone

03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult question
 
03:55:13.990 --> 03:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
what we could say is that
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
all these various scenarios
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
that that's why it's important to have a
 
03:55:24.870 --> 03:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
working group so that different voices
 
03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
and perspectives can bring various
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
scenarios to the table so that we're
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.269 --> 03:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr truman

can't i don't see it in here could you
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
define the current
 
03:55:45.520 --> 03:55:46.309 align:start position:0%
define the current
work

03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
what is the current definition for
 
03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:52.150 align:start position:0%
what is the current definition for
insanity

03:55:52.150 --> 03:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
for insane
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
um it is quote
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
shall include every idiot non-compos
 
03:56:03.750 --> 03:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
lunatic insane or distracted person

is the current
 
03:56:07.110 --> 03:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
isn't that all of us at one time or
 
03:56:07.120 --> 03:56:08.229 align:start position:0%
isn't that all of us at one time or
another

03:56:08.229 --> 03:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:56:08.239 --> 03:56:12.790 align:start position:0%
another
yes

03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:12.800 --> 03:56:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:56:14.229 --> 03:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
sure

representative smith

03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
as i understand it there are two parts
 
03:56:24.550 --> 03:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
to this
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
the first part
 
03:56:27.830 --> 03:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
and tell me where i'm wrong because i'm
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
sure i'm wrong
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
the first part is the
 
03:56:31.600 --> 03:56:32.950 align:start position:0%
the first part is the
definition

03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
of insanity
 
03:56:38.070 --> 03:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
the second part
 
03:56:42.309 --> 03:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
whatever that definition ends up being
 
03:56:42.319 --> 03:56:43.670 align:start position:0%
whatever that definition ends up being
is

03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:56:43.680 --> 03:56:45.590 align:start position:0%
is
how

03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:56:47.030 --> 03:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
you would
 
03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
use that definition to evaluate
 
03:56:54.550 --> 03:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
theoretically who has been receiving
 
03:56:56.560 --> 03:56:58.070 align:start position:0%
theoretically who has been receiving
treatment

03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:56:58.080 --> 03:56:59.590 align:start position:0%
treatment
has

03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:57:02.150 --> 03:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
moved past
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
the definition of insanity
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
to a point when they could be considered
 
03:57:08.319 --> 03:57:09.750 align:start position:0%
to a point when they could be considered
competent

03:57:09.750 --> 03:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
competent
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
is that close at all to what you're
 
03:57:18.790 --> 03:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
not exactly it's a great question so in
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
order to be deemed insane you have to be
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
deemed competent first
 
03:57:30.309 --> 03:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
so the goal is initially which dr bader
 
03:57:32.229 --> 03:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
can also testify to
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
is if there's alleged charges
 
03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
you know you work with your attorney and
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
the attorney
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
sees that there's a need for competency
 
03:57:42.550 --> 03:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
because the person does not seem
 
03:57:43.990 --> 03:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
mentally stable at the time so
 
03:57:46.630 --> 03:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
competency evaluation will be done
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
um and if they are unstable at the time
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
they will be deemed incompetent to stand
 
03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
trial for a period of 12 months for it's
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
a restoration period in the state of new
 
03:57:56.950 --> 03:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire is 12 months
 
03:57:58.870 --> 03:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
and then after that 12 months then they
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
have an evaluation again to see if they
 
03:58:02.710 --> 03:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
were able to gain competency or
 
03:58:02.720 --> 03:58:04.469 align:start position:0%
were able to gain competency or
competence

03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
competence
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
if they received treatment and what not
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
if they have not then they are deemed
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
incompetent not restorable
 
03:58:13.990 --> 03:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
and usually what we've seen is then
 
03:58:16.950 --> 03:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
cases are dropped or no crossed
 
03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
however if they are being competent then
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
they have then they are able to then
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
face their charges and neither plead
 
03:58:25.349 --> 03:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
guilty not guilty not guilty by reason
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
of insanity or no contest
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
and could i follow it
 
03:58:31.990 --> 03:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't understand
 
03:58:34.880 --> 03:58:36.790 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't understand
why

03:58:36.790 --> 03:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
the state builds a new
 
03:58:41.279 --> 03:58:42.830 align:start position:0%
the state builds a new
forensic

03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
forensic
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
hospital should play any role in this
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
legislation if
 
03:58:52.150 --> 03:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
we are suffering with an inappropriate
 
03:58:52.160 --> 03:58:53.269 align:start position:0%
we are suffering with an inappropriate
um

03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:53.279 --> 03:58:54.630 align:start position:0%
um
aged

03:58:54.630 --> 03:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
aged
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:03.830 --> 03:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
and if we want to figure out how we
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
manage competency
 
03:59:08.389 --> 03:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
the existence of the forensic hospital
 
03:59:10.630 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
or not is irrelevant to me
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:16.229 --> 03:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
no ma'am
 
03:59:16.239 --> 03:59:17.670 align:start position:0%
no ma'am
it's

03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
the goal is to parallel the process
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
with the the hospital um
 
03:59:25.269 --> 03:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
becoming available soon
 
03:59:27.910 --> 03:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
well soon in the next couple years soon
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
and to be able to use that to streamline
 
03:59:33.910 --> 03:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
treatment for incompetent individuals
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:41.429 --> 03:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
you if i could just
 
03:59:41.439 --> 03:59:42.389 align:start position:0%
you if i could just
please

03:59:42.389 --> 03:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i was under the impression and
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know so much more about this than i
 
03:59:46.880 --> 03:59:48.070 align:start position:0%
you know so much more about this than i
do

03:59:48.070 --> 03:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
that all that the state has talked about
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
so far is
 
03:59:57.510 --> 03:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
a facility there's been no talk about
 
04:00:00.070 --> 04:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
staffing the facility about equipping
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
the facility about programs for the
 
04:00:02.720 --> 04:00:04.389 align:start position:0%
the facility about programs for the
facility

04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:00:04.399 --> 04:00:05.189 align:start position:0%
facility
um

04:00:05.189 --> 04:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
i am concerned that if in the fullness
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
of time
 
04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
a facility
 
04:00:14.960 --> 04:00:16.229 align:start position:0%
a facility
doesn't

04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
come online
 
04:00:19.670 --> 04:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
would not
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
let me know if i misunderstood your
 
04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:34.710 --> 04:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
the importance of this working group is
 
04:00:37.990 --> 04:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the new forensic hospital
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
is as functional as possible in meeting
 
04:00:41.910 --> 04:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
its mission
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
on the books currently there are certain
 
04:00:43.760 --> 04:00:45.030 align:start position:0%
on the books currently there are certain
statutes

04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:00:45.040 --> 04:00:46.389 align:start position:0%
statutes
that

04:00:46.389 --> 04:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
dictate that these individuals of
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
various legal statuses
 
04:00:51.680 --> 04:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
various legal statuses
ngri

04:00:53.110 --> 04:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
ngri
 
04:00:55.269 --> 04:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes incompetent to stand trial
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
will be treated at the state prison
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
under the the secure psychiatric unit
 
04:01:02.309 --> 04:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
so it is important that if we're going
 
04:01:04.790 --> 04:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
to use the new facility
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
in order to treat these individuals
 
04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
that these statutes be updated and that
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
would be part of this working group's
 
04:01:14.790 --> 04:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
scope is to examine
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
all of the aspects of of uh or processes
 
04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
under which these forensic patients find
 
04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
themselves and ensure that
 
04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
the forensic hospital is functional from
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
a statutory standpoint
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
which can then be also translated into
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh staffing programming and what have
 
04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
you does that answer your question would
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
you permit me just one more
 
04:01:37.120 --> 04:01:38.469 align:start position:0%
you permit me just one more
certainly

04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
are you saying that if there was not
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
a plan for a new forensic hospital
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
you would be content with the current
 
04:01:52.389 --> 04:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
definition of insanity and the current
 
04:01:52.399 --> 04:01:53.510 align:start position:0%
definition of insanity and the current
law

04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
as to competency
 
04:01:57.910 --> 04:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
no ma'am that's not what i'm saying
 
04:02:00.150 --> 04:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yes ma'am representative
 
04:02:00.160 --> 04:02:01.830 align:start position:0%
thank you yes ma'am representative
mclean

04:02:01.830 --> 04:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
mclean
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
taking my questions so just to clarify
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
whether or not a forensic hospital were
 
04:02:10.870 --> 04:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
to be built
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
the goal of this is to kind of look at
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
where are the national practice
 
04:02:15.680 --> 04:02:17.030 align:start position:0%
where are the national practice
standards

04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
and to bring
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
our statutory law
 
04:02:24.150 --> 04:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
into alignment with those national
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
practice standards
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not a forensic hospital were
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
to be built is that correct
 
04:02:37.110 --> 04:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth do you have a
 
04:02:42.319 --> 04:02:44.630 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth do you have a
question

04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
so um thank you so much mr chairman and
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for entertaining this question
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
because i i feel like uh representative
 
04:02:54.229 --> 04:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
notter's question run with me
 
04:02:54.239 --> 04:02:54.950 align:start position:0%
notter's question run with me
but

04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:02:57.030 --> 04:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
then i read and i'm
 
04:02:58.630 --> 04:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know so frequently we think of
 
04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
insanity and restoration of competency
 
04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
in the criminal aspect but i see in the
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
very first statement of the bill this is
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
also civil and probate court matters so
 
04:03:10.469 --> 04:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
this is going to impact
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
um you know guardianships
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
correct and involuntary committals
 
04:03:16.950 --> 04:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
people that are outside
 
04:03:26.309 --> 04:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:26.319 --> 04:03:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.950 --> 04:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's not going to affect civil
 
04:04:04.950 --> 04:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
sorry could you say that again i didn't
 
04:04:13.590 --> 04:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody is already on a civil
 
04:04:15.520 --> 04:04:16.870 align:start position:0%
if somebody is already on a civil
commitment

04:04:16.870 --> 04:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
the civil commitment will stay with them
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
unless somehow they become justice
 
04:04:25.429 --> 04:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
involved and then it would be a hybrid
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the systems working together to
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
figure out and compromising on the best
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
is there a structure for the
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
collaboration between probate court and
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
civil court
 
04:04:50.229 --> 04:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
already or does that require rulemaking
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
somebody that may be under a
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
guardianship or involuntary commit both
 
04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:01.590 --> 04:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give this a shot
 
04:05:02.950 --> 04:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
currently there are statutory
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
requirements as to whether somebody is
 
04:05:07.590 --> 04:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
is seen in probate court or superior
 
04:05:09.680 --> 04:05:10.710 align:start position:0%
is seen in probate court or superior
court

04:05:10.710 --> 04:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
and we don't anticipate that these
 
04:05:15.189 --> 04:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
that this working group is going to be
 
04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
trying to change that
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
um i think it's everything downstream of
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in superior court or
 
04:05:28.630 --> 04:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
appeared before probate court
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you and
 
04:05:34.150 --> 04:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know you're much you've answered it
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
better but i'm i'm just the example of
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
somebody that is under a guardianship
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
after they've already committed a
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
criminal act right so then this might
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
impact them or no because they may be
 
04:05:46.399 --> 04:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
impact them or no because they may be
determined

04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
determined
 
04:05:48.000 --> 04:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
determined
insane

04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
insane
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
and the criminal charge maybe or there's
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
some you said the hybrid i'm not
 
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with that hybrid collaboration
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
is that in rules or is that just
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm running the risk of saying too much
 
04:06:04.389 --> 04:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
before we actually form the working
 
04:06:06.070 --> 04:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
group and work some of this stuff out
 
04:06:06.080 --> 04:06:07.510 align:start position:0%
group and work some of this stuff out
but

04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
what i would say is that um we don't
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
anticipate that guardianship is going to
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
be the function or or process by which
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
guardianship is determined would be
 
04:06:19.349 --> 04:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
altered um by this process by by
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
04:06:22.950 --> 04:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
so if i could just follow up one
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that you do consider though
 
04:06:30.150 --> 04:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
people that may have been criminally
 
04:06:31.750 --> 04:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
charged prior to the granting of a
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
guardianship and have
 
04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
so maybe i need to be part no i'm just
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
so i didn't really i appreciate your
 
04:06:42.309 --> 04:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
question because i wasn't asking for a
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
change in the guardianship process i'm
 
04:06:46.150 --> 04:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
just concerned that this definition may
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
impact people under guardianship that
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
have been criminally charged
 
04:06:52.710 --> 04:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:06:54.960 --> 04:06:55.750 align:start position:0%
other questions
yes

04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:06:58.150 --> 04:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative langley
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you that the uh
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
original definition that goes back to
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
the 1700s is abominable and really we
 
04:07:10.229 --> 04:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
should be embarrassed that we still have
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
it on the books
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
that being said i'm not clear as to how
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to redefine it and also
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
integrate it with the dsm
 
04:07:21.670 --> 04:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
because a lot of work has been done in
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
terms of diagnostic work over the years
 
04:07:27.189 --> 04:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
so it's hard for me as i i look at this
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
law to see how we're going to integrate
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
that work
 
04:07:33.110 --> 04:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
with a more succinct definition of
 
04:07:33.120 --> 04:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
with a more succinct definition of
solely

04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
solely
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
insanity can you help me understand that
 
04:07:36.479 --> 04:07:37.750 align:start position:0%
insanity can you help me understand that
better

04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:07:37.760 --> 04:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
better
yes

04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
04:07:44.149 --> 04:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
um fortunately we have many road maps
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
that other states have already trodden
 
04:07:49.110 --> 04:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
in trying to balance this
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
fidelity that we want to show the dsm
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
in defining mental illness
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
and the legal definition
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
of insanity and how that's applied
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
within within the legal system
 
04:08:00.880 --> 04:08:02.149 align:start position:0%
within within the legal system
um

04:08:02.149 --> 04:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
there um are
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
there have been trends uh amongst the
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
states that use uh one of
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
only a couple of standards
 
04:08:13.030 --> 04:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:08:15.110 --> 04:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
i anticipate that part of the work of
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
this working group would be to
 
04:08:19.830 --> 04:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
look at these standards that have been
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
established over decades have been
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
vetted through
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
many many many years of case law as well
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
and determine what makes sense for new
 
04:08:29.920 --> 04:08:35.189 align:start position:0%
and determine what makes sense for new
hampshire

04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
other questions representative lorenzo
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you know as we
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
were talking about um
 
04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
insanity and the the grounds for
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
insanity i thought about the mcnaughton
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
rule which is based in common law um
 
04:08:56.229 --> 04:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
how is that applied these days and it
 
04:08:57.910 --> 04:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
would have any would have any relevance
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
the mcnaughton standard that you
 
04:09:07.920 --> 04:09:08.950 align:start position:0%
the mcnaughton standard that you
reference

04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
reference
 
04:09:11.110 --> 04:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
among those states that do offer an
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
insanity defense this is the most
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
commonly applied standard and so while
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
it does have a
 
04:09:19.990 --> 04:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
a basis a tradition
 
04:09:20.000 --> 04:09:21.030 align:start position:0%
a basis a tradition
in

04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:09:21.040 --> 04:09:22.389 align:start position:0%
in
in

04:09:22.389 --> 04:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
common law
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
it has been statutorily ratified in a
 
04:09:29.670 --> 04:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
number of jurisdictions
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
it is no doubt should this working group
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
be approved in form it would be
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
considered um
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.149 --> 04:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
i could just so
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with the definition of
 
04:09:56.469 --> 04:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
insanity and i understand that's part of
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
the intent is to come up with a new
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
definition but you're also dealing it
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
seems like the focus seems to be on the
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
court process
 
04:10:06.630 --> 04:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
and competency
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
and my understanding
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
the standard
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
for evaluating competency is different
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
than insanity it's not insanity so
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
is it
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
your intent to meld the two or are we
 
04:10:27.990 --> 04:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with two different subjects
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
those subjects would be dealt with
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
individually okay
 
04:10:32.399 --> 04:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
individually okay
the

04:10:33.910 --> 04:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
the second question i have is
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to the structure of this
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
working group because it seems to be
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
large and
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how wieldy it is but
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure any legislators want to be
 
04:10:50.830 --> 04:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
on it but that's another whole issue
 
04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
i i might assign representative wolper
 
04:10:56.800 --> 04:10:58.389 align:start position:0%
i i might assign representative wolper
um

04:10:58.389 --> 04:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:58.399 --> 04:10:59.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
long in the short is
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that you you've appeared
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
here today and we really appreciate you
 
04:11:08.790 --> 04:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
being here today because you have
 
04:11:08.800 --> 04:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
being here today because you have
expertise

04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.000 --> 04:11:12.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what expertise some
 
04:11:16.469 --> 04:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
of the other people who have been named
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
to this commission are going to add to
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
defining insanity
 
04:11:21.199 --> 04:11:22.469 align:start position:0%
defining insanity
or

04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:11:22.479 --> 04:11:23.830 align:start position:0%
or
even

04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue of competency and
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
restoration of competency
 
04:11:31.110 --> 04:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
would it
 
04:11:33.110 --> 04:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think in terms of
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
structuring the way that this should be
 
04:11:37.189 --> 04:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
addressed i'm just wondering if it would
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
not be better
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
to authorize the department of health
 
04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
and services to come up with a
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation and direct that they
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
consult with these individual peop
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
individual groups
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
in doing so
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
to be a far more efficient process than
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
trying to create a commission which
 
04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard several times here today you
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
can't get a quorum for so that's another
 
04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
whole issue so
 
04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if um that might be a
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
what i would offer is that although the
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
interacts with individuals who have been
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
deemed not guilty by reason of insanity
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
who are charged with attempting to treat
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
and therefore restore the competency of
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
those who are deemed unfit to stand
 
04:12:25.680 --> 04:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
those who are deemed unfit to stand
trial

04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
trial
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
currently the department of health and
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
human services does not make those
 
04:12:33.030 --> 04:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
determinations those are made by
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
the office of foreign
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
with the aid of the office of friends
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
examiners under the department of
 
04:12:37.199 --> 04:12:38.469 align:start position:0%
examiners under the department of
corrections

04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
so you can see that already just on on
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
the face of it we have
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
already two departments who are very
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
involved in this we think that what we
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
have proposed or that what it has been
 
04:12:49.439 --> 04:12:50.550 align:start position:0%
have proposed or that what it has been
proposed

04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:12:50.560 --> 04:12:51.349 align:start position:0%
proposed
is

04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
a good um
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
a good attempt to bring
 
04:12:57.269 --> 04:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
together all the stakeholders who have
 
04:12:57.279 --> 04:13:00.790 align:start position:0%
together all the stakeholders who have
various

04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
degrees of expertise in all these issues
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
the ramifications aren't just going to
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
be perfectly understood by the
 
04:13:09.990 --> 04:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
and while we could consult the
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
department of justice or department of
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
corrections truly within their realms
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
and way that it impacts the work that
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
they do and that
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
the citizenry of new hampshire they are
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
the experts within their own niche i
 
04:13:25.750 --> 04:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
think it's important to bring them in in
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
a much more formalized
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
sing then
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thanks for
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.479 --> 04:14:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:14:11.110 --> 04:14:11.120 align:start position:0%

did want to take er enough the
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to thank the sponsors for
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%

on this commission i do understand that
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
there are some amendments to change it
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
from a
 
04:14:41.110 --> 04:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
legislative commission to
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
some other working group under the
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
executive branch which we
 
04:14:47.349 --> 04:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
would not have an opinion on one way or
 
04:14:48.870 --> 04:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the the committee for
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
as you've heard there's currently not a
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
restoration process in the state of new
 
04:15:05.349 --> 04:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm going to speak to
 
04:15:05.359 --> 04:15:06.389 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm going to speak to
the

04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:08.550 --> 04:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
restoration portion
 
04:15:10.070 --> 04:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
competency portion of this and not the
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
insanity portion of the spill
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
because they are separate and distinct
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
but currently there's no restoration
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
process and
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
at nami new hampshire we have heard from
 
04:15:24.000 --> 04:15:25.269 align:start position:0%
at nami new hampshire we have heard from
families

04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:15:25.279 --> 04:15:26.630 align:start position:0%
families
of

04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
their loved ones who have become justice
 
04:15:29.040 --> 04:15:30.309 align:start position:0%
their loved ones who have become justice
involved

04:15:30.309 --> 04:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:15:32.149 --> 04:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
that they see this as a missed
 
04:15:32.159 --> 04:15:34.070 align:start position:0%
that they see this as a missed
opportunity

04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
one would think that
 
04:15:38.630 --> 04:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
um everybody involved the families of
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
these folks would be
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
happy that after a year
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
competency hasn't been restored and the
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
charges are dropped
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
but what they really see is that that's
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
a missed opportunity for their loved one
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.880 --> 04:16:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
what the families have seen is that
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
their loved ones go on to potentially
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
become homeless
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
commit other crimes
 
04:16:11.670 --> 04:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
commit more serious crimes
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
or have other unfortunate
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
and there are mental health courts
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
within the state of new hampshire
 
04:16:24.469 --> 04:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
but these folks
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
the ag's office and other lawyers behind
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
me will also let you know that the the
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
mental health courts aren't an option
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
because you have to be able to give
 
04:16:36.149 --> 04:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
informed consent and you have to
 
04:16:38.790 --> 04:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
understand the judicial process
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
and those are you know um folks that are
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
deemed incompetent
 
04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
can't give informed consent
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
and do not have the ability to
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
understand the judicial process at the
 
04:16:51.040 --> 04:16:52.389 align:start position:0%
understand the judicial process at the
time

04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:16:53.910 --> 04:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
and so this commission would would allow
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
for the state to look at
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
all the options that are out there and
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
maybe even creative and do what new
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire does best which has come up
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire solutions
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
chairman gordon you're concerned about
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
the unwieldy size of this
 
04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to let you know that
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know from nami new hampshire's
 
04:17:20.800 --> 04:17:22.229 align:start position:0%
you know from nami new hampshire's
perspective

04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
we do talk with these families
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
and we work with these folks and i think
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
that we can bring bring a perspective
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
to a commission
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to come up with
 
04:17:35.429 --> 04:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
some creative solutions with the defense
 
04:17:35.439 --> 04:17:36.630 align:start position:0%
some creative solutions with the defense
bar

04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
bar
 
04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
and with the ag's office
 
04:17:40.630 --> 04:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
and with the department of corrections
 
04:17:43.110 --> 04:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
and the department of human services
 
04:17:45.990 --> 04:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that these folks are able to receive
 
04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
the treatment that they need
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
and if they are restored
 
04:17:52.880 --> 04:17:54.389 align:start position:0%
and if they are restored
that

04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
maybe there can be some other
 
04:17:59.110 --> 04:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
alternatives for these folks other than
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
simply incarceration
 
04:18:02.399 --> 04:18:03.670 align:start position:0%
simply incarceration
that

04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know given
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
their mental health status at the time
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
that they committed the crime
 
04:18:12.229 --> 04:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
that maybe we can come up with some
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
other alternatives such as the mental
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
wealth court system
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
once folks are restored
 
04:18:20.550 --> 04:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
so i would urge this committee to
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
seriously consider
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
voting this through as either a working
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
group or a commission
 
04:18:29.349 --> 04:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this and i will uh
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:38.469 --> 04:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.880 --> 04:18:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
please

04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon my name is jeff
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
strollson i'm an associate attorney
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
general with new hampshire attorney
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
general's office and a prosecutor about
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
25 years now and have spent
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of time dealing with
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
competency and insanity issues in the
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill the
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
reason i want to come up is to be able
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that any of you
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
might have after listening to some of
 
04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
these the questions i've heard before
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
about how those two things work in the
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system and why we had a
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
concern about just changing the
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
definition of criminal insanity and what
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
that would mean and dr beta can
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
introduce herself my name is dr bader
 
04:19:34.149 --> 04:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
i'm a board certified forensic
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
psychologist i'm also the chief forensic
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
evaluator for the state of new hampshire
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
so my office isn't responsible for doing
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
all the evaluations for competency and
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
sanity throughout the state
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
and i want to give a little background
 
04:19:48.389 --> 04:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
about both those legal terms since we've
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
been talking about them a lot
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
the first thing to know is that
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
individuals with severe psychiatric
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
illness or intellectual deficits usually
 
04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
need to well end up often needing two
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
different extra hearings when they get
 
04:20:00.960 --> 04:20:01.990 align:start position:0%
different extra hearings when they get
arrested

04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
the first one is a competency to stand
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
trial evaluation and then a hearing
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
this is really that requirement by our
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
constitution that folks are aware and
 
04:20:13.110 --> 04:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of their of their rights
 
04:20:15.110 --> 04:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
and what's happening at court
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a hidden process in our
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
state a lot of folks don't even know
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
that competency evaluations happen or
 
04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
that this process exists but it's
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
necessary and is required and so if
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
someone is not well enough to be part of
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
their case then they're they're deemed
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
not competent to stand trial and then we
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
give a year for that person to get
 
04:20:33.199 --> 04:20:34.710 align:start position:0%
give a year for that person to get
better

04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
now what's important is that our state
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
is the only state in the entire country
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
that does not have a formalized process
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
for folks to actually get better so the
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
court determines that this person is not
 
04:20:48.790 --> 04:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
well enough psychiatrically
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
to actually be part of their case
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're expected to independently then
 
04:20:56.229 --> 04:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
go navigate medicaid
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
make their own appointments arrange
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
transportation and get well on their own
 
04:21:03.269 --> 04:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from experience that that
 
04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
does not happen
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
and our numbers show that
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
most states show 80 percent of folks
 
04:21:11.110 --> 04:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
become restored in their restoration
 
04:21:13.030 --> 04:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
period in new hampshire our rates are
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
below 40 percent
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
this is terrible
 
04:21:19.110 --> 04:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i will also say the folks who are
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
restored have a couple of things that
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
have happened one
 
04:21:24.790 --> 04:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
their family members are involved
 
04:21:26.710 --> 04:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
maybe they've been part of this legal
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
process with them and they are now you
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
know they found them they were homeless
 
04:21:31.110 --> 04:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
now they know where they are and they
 
04:21:31.120 --> 04:21:31.990 align:start position:0%
now they know where they are and they
help

04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
or two they leave the state they go to
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or they go to new york and
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
they're hospitalized in new york or
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and then come back
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
those are the folks that are restored
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
our process does not simply isn't broken
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't exist
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
so as i said 40
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
of our folks are restored that means
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
that 60 percent of those defendants have
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
their cases dropped
 
04:21:59.110 --> 04:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
those cases disappear
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
those victims get no day in court
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
they get no chance to have their
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
case resolved that defendant has no
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
chance to have their day in court they
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
have no chance for the court to prove
 
04:22:14.229 --> 04:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
charges against them
 
04:22:17.110 --> 04:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
in my experience attorneys lawyers
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
psychologists people working at new
 
04:22:21.189 --> 04:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and nami we rarely
 
04:22:21.199 --> 04:22:22.309 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and nami we rarely
agree

04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
about details we rarely agree about big
 
04:22:24.800 --> 04:22:25.830 align:start position:0%
about details we rarely agree about big
pictures

04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
pictures
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
we all have very different views
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
agree that the system is broken and it
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed and repaired
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i want to address what someone said
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
earlier about
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
why do we need a commission i've been
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
here for six years and i will tell you
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
that there have been actual earnest
 
04:22:46.469 --> 04:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
driven attempts to fix this process
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
there have been these meetings between
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
dhhs doc the ag's office we've had
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
working groups we've had judicial
 
04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
working groups there are county level
 
04:22:58.149 --> 04:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
groups i have a meeting on friday at the
 
04:22:59.910 --> 04:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
our month our quarterly merrimack
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
meeting hillsboro has been very active
 
04:23:05.830 --> 04:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
we are unable to get to the actual
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
changes we need because most people
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
aren't able to all be there at the same
 
04:23:11.910 --> 04:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
time as we've as we've heard we need
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
both new hampshire hospital department
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
of corrections the ag's office all of
 
04:23:17.910 --> 04:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
those folks but we need the judges on
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
board and then we'll have a meeting and
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
we realize we need the new hampshire
 
04:23:23.110 --> 04:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
system on board they're not at the
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
meeting this is the first time we've
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
developed a working group that may feel
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
unwieldy but actually has every person
 
04:23:32.469 --> 04:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
that we need at the table
 
04:23:34.469 --> 04:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
it also requires us to have deadlines
 
04:23:37.030 --> 04:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
and a structure that has been lacking we
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
have gotten together all the time and we
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
talk and we talk and we talk and we talk
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
and we all say oh gosh it's so broken
 
04:23:47.110 --> 04:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
having this working group as a judi as
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
an executive group in my opinion is the
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
first step we have to actually having
 
04:23:53.830 --> 04:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
quantifiable reliable structured
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
deadlines which will make this process
 
04:23:57.670 --> 04:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
actually improve
 
04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i want to be really clear the
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
competency restoration piece is broken
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about insanity
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
this large group of people 60
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
of these defendants aren't getting
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
competent they don't even get a chance
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
to plead insanity
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
because they're not competent
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
they can't plead insanity they can't go
 
04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
to mental health court they can't take a
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
very favorable plea bargain their case
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
is over
 
04:24:25.030 --> 04:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i want to be really clear that folks
 
04:24:26.950 --> 04:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
who are concerned about public safety
 
04:24:29.349 --> 04:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
should be very concerned about this
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
those folks go to court
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
the judge hears that they're not
 
04:24:34.950 --> 04:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
competent not restored
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
they leave
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
they leave they're not held
 
04:24:41.110 --> 04:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
they simply go
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
and again we're hearing from nami we're
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
hearing from new hampshire hospital
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from all these other folks
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
that there's this high risk of continued
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
homelessness continued drug use and
 
04:24:48.960 --> 04:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
homelessness continued drug use and
re-arrest

04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
re-arrest
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
at no point has there ever been a
 
04:24:53.910 --> 04:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
discussion that this is something that
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
is a fly-by-night issue it's just time
 
04:24:57.910 --> 04:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i think everyone on board is now
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
saying that we need help structuring
 
04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
ourselves and having um some sort of
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
authority telling us to sort of show up
 
04:25:09.030 --> 04:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
so i would just say comment about what
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
it's like from our perspective and
 
04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
having to explain the victims and for us
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
this comes up in murder cases that
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
someone commits a murder
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
and maybe there are multiple victims
 
04:25:21.359 --> 04:25:22.790 align:start position:0%
and maybe there are multiple victims
involved

04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
that perpetrator is not found competent
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
to stand trial
 
04:25:28.630 --> 04:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
and because of the system or the lack of
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
the system we have in new hampshire
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
within a year
 
04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
if the court determines that person has
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
not been restored to competency which is
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
dr bader said in 60 percent of the cases
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
that person uh
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
unless they've been civilly committed
 
04:25:42.149 --> 04:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
walks out the door and that's a very
 
04:25:43.830 --> 04:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
difficult discussion to have with family
 
04:25:43.840 --> 04:25:44.710 align:start position:0%
difficult discussion to have with family
members

04:25:44.710 --> 04:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
but why it is that there will be no day
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
in court essentially for what happened
 
04:25:48.479 --> 04:25:49.429 align:start position:0%
in court essentially for what happened
here

04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:25:50.950 --> 04:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
i also want to explain that competency
 
04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
to stand trial is different than
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
criminal insanity
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
competency to stand trial is whether or
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
not the person is capable of assisting
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
their lawyers and understanding the
 
04:26:03.110 --> 04:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
legal process and competency to stand
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
trial can change
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
somebody could initially be competent
 
04:26:07.750 --> 04:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
but then they're not taking their
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
medication not getting treatment they
 
04:26:11.429 --> 04:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
could become incompetent they could
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
become competent again and incompetent
 
04:26:13.680 --> 04:26:14.870 align:start position:0%
become competent again and incompetent
again

04:26:14.870 --> 04:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:26:17.429 --> 04:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
criminal insanity is a snapshot of one
 
04:26:19.030 --> 04:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
moment in time
 
04:26:21.429 --> 04:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
was that person criminally insane when
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
they committed the crime so it's two
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
very different things
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's important to have
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
very clear standards about one versus
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
the other the standard for competency is
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
pretty much universally the same across
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
the country there's pretty much one
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
standard everybody's developed
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
for the criminal insanity test there are
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
essentially four different versions of
 
04:26:42.389 --> 04:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
it across the country and new hampshire
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
uses a version that no one else uses
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
was well meaning to to change that
 
04:26:51.670 --> 04:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
definition of insane
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
the problem is that it would have
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
changed the definition of criminal
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
insanity and that's what got our
 
04:26:55.840 --> 04:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
insanity and that's what got our
attention

04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
and the reason that matters is because
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
you have cases already in the pipeline
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
where one standard's being used
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
lawyers practitioners across new
 
04:27:07.269 --> 04:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire you know what a certain
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
standard is judges do there are jury
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
instructions that talk about that
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
standard and we just thought it made
 
04:27:15.189 --> 04:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
sense to really think before we change
 
04:27:16.469 --> 04:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
the standard that we've used for
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years in this state
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
and so the standard for ins criminal
 
04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
insanity in new hampshire is this
 
04:27:25.990 --> 04:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
did the defendant have a mental illness
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
that caused them to commit the crime
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the question that's
 
04:27:31.830 --> 04:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
the standard in new hampshire and so
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's different than
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
are they capable of assisting their
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
lawyers which is the competency standard
 
04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
so i just want to tell you there are two
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
very different things
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
and the commission would look at
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
the competency issue
 
04:27:45.510 --> 04:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
should we put a process together that
 
04:27:47.830 --> 04:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
helps people become competent to stand
 
04:27:47.840 --> 04:27:48.790 align:start position:0%
helps people become competent to stand
trial

04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
trial
 
04:27:50.950 --> 04:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
and on the insanity piece it would be
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
should we keep the definition of
 
04:27:54.550 --> 04:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
criminal insanity that we have or change
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
it that doesn't mean you couldn't change
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
that definition that's on the books
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
about insane because you can have a
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
civil definition of insane but the
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
criminal defense definition could be
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
different and so again that's why we
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
jumped in when we saw that but i wanted
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
to understand the kind of the scope of
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
the issues here and and why it matters
 
04:28:12.870 --> 04:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
at least in the criminal justice system
 
04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
and we'd be happy to answer any
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone has just when i
 
04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
teach about this we always say uh
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
competency is current so when you think
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
competency is current and then insanity
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
is in the past so when they were
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
arrested were they sick at the time when
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
they were arrested competency is
 
04:28:27.040 --> 04:28:28.710 align:start position:0%
they were arrested competency is
occurring

04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
and competency can change insanity is a
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
fixed point in time you're either insane
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
or not insane when you commit the crime
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
it can never change
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
and we'd be happy to answer any
 
04:28:39.910 --> 04:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions yep are there questions for
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
attorney sterlison or dr bader
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative simpson did you have a
 
04:28:45.040 --> 04:28:46.070 align:start position:0%
representative simpson did you have a
question

04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
i do thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:28:51.429 --> 04:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
i think we're hearing from you some
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of why this
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
either commission or
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
um working group
 
04:28:59.110 --> 04:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
so big but i just want to
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
drill down on that for a minute and i
 
04:29:07.269 --> 04:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
think what i'm hearing from you is that
 
04:29:08.950 --> 04:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
many of you on this list don't always
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
agree about these issues and your hope
 
04:29:13.349 --> 04:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
is that if we
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
as a legislature
 
04:29:15.520 --> 04:29:18.550 align:start position:0%
as a legislature
um

04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.710 --> 04:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
guide you direct you to all be in the
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
same room for the same amount of time
 
04:29:24.149 --> 04:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
with a fixed deadline for
 
04:29:25.510 --> 04:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
for change
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
then um
 
04:29:29.110 --> 04:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
you would be able to come to some kind
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
of agreement through rigorous work and
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
conversation and
 
04:29:34.159 --> 04:29:35.030 align:start position:0%
conversation and
um

04:29:35.030 --> 04:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
compromise and negotiation and all of
 
04:29:37.750 --> 04:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
those things
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes and i think um what's true is that
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
we actually haven't all been together um
 
04:29:47.189 --> 04:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
there's been you know even when judges
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
call meetings we can't get everybody
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
together the mental health system is so
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
separate from the judicial system that
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get all of us in the same
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
room so we haven't really all been
 
04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
together about these topics
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
the other piece is that
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
someone could have a
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
could have an idea very well meaning to
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
change something but not realize that
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
that ramifications in another area
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're simply not fluent in
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
and so like i said changing the civil
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
definition of insane and not realizing
 
04:30:14.469 --> 04:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
that the definition you punch in will
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
change the definition for criminal
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
insanity that's part of the reason to
 
04:30:19.349 --> 04:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
kind of get everybody in the same room
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
not so much because we disagree but just
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure ah that's a great idea but
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
if you do that that's going to affect me
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
over here let's coordinate that better
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
and think about why we want to do that i
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
think that's part of the thought process
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
behind this
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
i want to add to that that you know as
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
clinicians we don't always think about
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
wording the same way attorneys do so
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
things like and instead of
 
04:30:38.399 --> 04:30:39.189 align:start position:0%
things like and instead of
or

04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
can change entire definitions and so
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's why we need everybody there
 
04:30:44.399 --> 04:30:45.429 align:start position:0%
that's why we need everybody there
together

04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:30:49.110 --> 04:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.890 --> 04:30:49.900 align:start position:0%
tell me about your dream
 
04:30:49.900 --> 04:30:53.349 align:start position:0%
tell me about your dream
[Laughter]

04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:30:54.800 --> 04:30:56.229 align:start position:0%
other questions
representative

04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
04:31:01.110 --> 04:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
question um there's 50 states so um do
 
04:31:03.429 --> 04:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
the other states have this issue as well
 
04:31:04.469 --> 04:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
or do
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
is there a state that has it all
 
04:31:09.269 --> 04:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
nicely worded
 
04:31:11.830 --> 04:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh for competency or insanity
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
for both so good question um so like we
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
said the the standard for competency is
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
is pretty much the same in every state
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
um in terms of getting people restored
 
04:31:23.110 --> 04:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
to competency
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
every state has sort of different
 
04:31:24.479 --> 04:31:25.590 align:start position:0%
every state has sort of different
versions

04:31:25.590 --> 04:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
versions
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
i think we would need a new hampshire
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
specific version of how to best do this
 
04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
we have proposals that we've been
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
discussing as a large group but again
 
04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers haven't really
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
been able to weigh in on if those are
 
04:31:38.229 --> 04:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
realistic and we would need their
 
04:31:38.239 --> 04:31:39.590 align:start position:0%
realistic and we would need their
assistance

04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
um so we have a lot thankfully because
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
we have no system we're not fixing
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
something we get to build it from the
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
ground up
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
and that's a great position to be in
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
because all other states have shown us
 
04:31:52.389 --> 04:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
what works and doesn't work we can take
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
the best bits and build what i think
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be new hampshire's ideal version
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
um that's both
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
efficient and economic and and the right
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
thing for what we need and in terms of
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
insanity yeah i think
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
there are different standards and so
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
some states have chosen different
 
04:32:09.680 --> 04:32:10.950 align:start position:0%
some states have chosen different
standards

04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:32:12.630 --> 04:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
and again we could look at see what
 
04:32:14.469 --> 04:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
would be the best fit for new hampshire
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
some people are
 
04:32:18.149 --> 04:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily dissatisfied with
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
our current standard again the language
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be updated but i think we've
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
never really had as a group a good
 
04:32:24.880 --> 04:32:25.830 align:start position:0%
never really had as a group a good
really

04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
targeted discussion about what it should
 
04:32:27.920 --> 04:32:28.950 align:start position:0%
targeted discussion about what it should
be

04:32:28.950 --> 04:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that any one state is the
 
04:32:32.550 --> 04:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
shining example we would have to pull
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
from a variety of solutions
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
i mean right now the system that we have
 
04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
for restoration of competency is so
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
lacking that anything would be an
 
04:32:43.269 --> 04:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
improvement so you could certainly look
 
04:32:44.710 --> 04:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
at what other states do and as far as
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
the definition definition for criminal
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
insanity the definition from our
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
perspective works fine
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
the question is can you separate it from
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
the civil definition just to make clear
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
that one pertains to one area one
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
pertains to the other instead of making
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
a definition that pertains to both that
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
then turns around and does this major
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
upheaval in the criminal justice world
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
what the definition of criminal insanity
 
04:33:04.561 --> 04:33:09.590 align:start position:0%
what the definition of criminal insanity
means

04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
i guess uh
 
04:33:17.750 --> 04:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:19.429 --> 04:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
it says that there'll be a minimum of 10
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
meetings with an account a year but you
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
have to make a report by
 
04:33:23.039 --> 04:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
have to make a report by
november

04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
november
 
04:33:24.480 --> 04:33:26.470 align:start position:0%
november
first

04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:33:26.480 --> 04:33:27.189 align:start position:0%
first
so

04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:30.310 --> 04:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
is there a need for 10 meetings in a
 
04:33:30.320 --> 04:33:31.910 align:start position:0%
is there a need for 10 meetings in a
year

04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
maybe instead of is it i can't remember
 
04:33:35.590 --> 04:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
if it says you shall have i mean it
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
could it could be that you may have
 
04:33:38.400 --> 04:33:41.429 align:start position:0%
could it could be that you may have
shout

04:33:41.429 --> 04:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:44.709 --> 04:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
it turn it to maybe
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's because that's you know that
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
essentially means there's one month
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
without a meeting and here we are in
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
april so
 
04:33:53.510 --> 04:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make much sense
 
04:33:53.520 --> 04:33:54.629 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make much sense
certainly

04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
we can reach that number by doubling up
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
in a month of course i mean i think
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
that's something you can leave to the
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
senators who are so excited to be
 
04:34:01.520 --> 04:34:02.551 align:start position:0%
senators who are so excited to be
joining

04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
joining
 
04:34:02.561 --> 04:34:03.750 align:start position:0%
joining
um

04:34:03.750 --> 04:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
but i will say that i think again having
 
04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
that structure we haven't been able to
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
have monthly meetings with all those
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
necessary stakeholders so um
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
having a that due date
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and maybe splitting off into smaller
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
groups and having drafts all of those
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
things would be
 
04:34:21.429 --> 04:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't we just appoint dr bader
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
as the
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
chairperson i can answer that honestly i
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
i i can answer that honestly i would say
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
that most people in this room i think
 
04:34:32.230 --> 04:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
will tell you that i've been a chief
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
advocate for competency restoration
 
04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
since i've took taken this job
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
and i have not achieved anything
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
um i feel like i'm a strong voice for
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
why we need it and everyone again is in
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
agreement but we have nothing we have no
 
04:34:47.429 --> 04:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
paperwork we have not we have no
 
04:34:47.439 --> 04:34:48.390 align:start position:0%
paperwork we have not we have no
um

04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
legislative proposals
 
04:34:50.639 --> 04:34:51.750 align:start position:0%
legislative proposals
and

04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:53.910 --> 04:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
i have we've tried pilot programs we
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
have tried a variety of things we are
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
i've worked closely with samhsa which is
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
a big national organization to try to
 
04:35:01.590 --> 04:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
get assistance to come to new hampshire
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
and help us with this process
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
we still have nothing
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
so i would love to tell you that i could
 
04:35:08.551 --> 04:35:08.561 align:start position:0%
share something and it would happen but
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
i've shown that i can't and that's why
 
04:35:13.109 --> 04:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
we need this unwieldy group because this
 
04:35:14.789 --> 04:35:14.799 align:start position:0%
is one of those things that needs all
 
04:35:17.429 --> 04:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
the silos coming together uh to work on
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i guess the the only other question
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
i have is
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
basically as i look at the amendment and
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
i look at the original bill
 
04:35:36.070 --> 04:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's in essence the same committee the
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
only difference is
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
who's going to
 
04:35:42.629 --> 04:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
convene it that i can see
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i don't think there are
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
substantive changes
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
so it it gets changed from a
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
legislative committee to an executive
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee by virtue of who's going to
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
call the meeting
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
i think that reflects our desire to
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually have some movement and change i
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
think there is um
 
04:36:07.109 --> 04:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
momentum behind this topic and i think
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
we understand that the we understand
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
that the time
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
pull for all of you is is dire and so i
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
don't we don't want your time needs to
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily block the
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
continuation of these processes that are
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
really necessary
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually represent mclean did you have a
 
04:36:29.520 --> 04:36:30.789 align:start position:0%
actually represent mclean did you have a
question

04:36:30.789 --> 04:36:30.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:35.840 --> 04:36:37.349 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
am flattered
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the legislature
 
04:36:45.429 --> 04:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
that you think we can change
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
human behavior
 
04:36:49.750 --> 04:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
04:36:51.990 --> 04:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
just want to make that clear
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
when i look at this saying
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
working group members shall be appointed
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
within 30 days you shall meet
 
04:37:05.189 --> 04:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
i think it says within 45 days there
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
10 meetings
 
04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%
each of us sitting here
 
04:37:16.629 --> 04:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
could list a dozen different entities
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
that we're familiar with where that same
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
or similar language exists where nothing
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
including the chair not
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
calling the first meeting
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
do you really think that by the
 
04:37:34.080 --> 04:37:37.269 align:start position:0%
do you really think that by the
legislature

04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
the serious problem that you're facing
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
that i think all of us recognize
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
is going to get resolved
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to start trying
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
and that's i think what the bill my
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the bill is trying
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
to do is to simply start the process and
 
04:37:59.760 --> 04:38:00.709 align:start position:0%
to do is to simply start the process and
try

04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
try
 
04:38:00.719 --> 04:38:01.510 align:start position:0%
try
so

04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
again from our perspective we support it
 
04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
because it is an attempt to get people
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
together in a room to address a serious
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
issue and to make sure that all the
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
voices are heard so that nobody comes
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
back here with a bill
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
and then there are people lined up
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
raising their hands to speak to say why
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't do it and the question you
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
may all ask is why didn't you all get
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
together and figure this out before you
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
got here so i think it is it's an
 
04:38:23.189 --> 04:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
attempt we all recognize human frailties
 
04:38:25.750 --> 04:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm an optimist so
 
04:38:30.629 --> 04:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.070 --> 04:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative chase did you have a
 
04:38:32.080 --> 04:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
okay representative chase did you have a
question

04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:38:35.590 --> 04:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
question it's kind of a
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
piggybacks on what uh representative
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
smith said
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
i was thinking the same thing and also
 
04:38:45.439 --> 04:38:46.390 align:start position:0%
i was thinking the same thing and also
so

04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
all of these these entities that you've
 
04:38:50.551 --> 04:38:50.561 align:start position:0%
been talking about are all on board to
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
do this you're just saying you need
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
direction and you need someone to put
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
the hammer down and say this is what you
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
is is everybody in agreement that
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to do this and
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
is it just taking legislation in order
 
04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
to make that happen
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
i think too there's i think the hammer
 
04:39:12.629 --> 04:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
is meaningful to me i mean i think
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
there's been discussions right among us
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying this is an important topic this
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
is an important topic this is an
 
04:39:23.189 --> 04:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
important topic but the status quo has
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
been the way it was for a very long time
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i think in my experience too having
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature say no actually this is
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
important we do want you to meet about
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
this topic
 
04:39:34.709 --> 04:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
has a lot of meaning to this group and i
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
will say that i agree with you this
 
04:39:38.948 --> 04:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
question about well will people show up
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
i found that when judges say we're going
 
04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
04:39:44.150 --> 04:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
people show up um when we're saying
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
we're meeting about this legislative
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know post legislative bills such and
 
04:39:50.708 --> 04:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
such you know 392 passing we're meeting
 
04:39:52.948 --> 04:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
that carries a weight um
 
04:39:52.958 --> 04:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
that carries a weight um
that

04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
clears people's calendars a little bit
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
more than just hey dr bader would like
 
04:39:58.470 --> 04:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
us all to meet and she's going to bring
 
04:39:58.480 --> 04:40:00.310 align:start position:0%
us all to meet and she's going to bring
donuts

04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
donuts
 
04:40:00.320 --> 04:40:01.270 align:start position:0%
donuts
um

04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
that hasn't worked so far
 
04:40:03.200 --> 04:40:04.150 align:start position:0%
that hasn't worked so far
so

04:40:04.150 --> 04:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
i i do think there is a hammer
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
here that is
 
04:40:07.840 --> 04:40:08.948 align:start position:0%
here that is
valuable

04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
um and again i think there's also that
 
04:40:12.550 --> 04:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
piece too that we're really hoping that
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i i do feel close to this that i
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
think if we have all these people in the
 
04:40:16.480 --> 04:40:17.590 align:start position:0%
think if we have all these people in the
room

04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
we have existing drafts of potential
 
04:40:20.400 --> 04:40:22.070 align:start position:0%
we have existing drafts of potential
legislation

04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have to get agreement about how we
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
think about those moving forward we
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
could come back next session and say
 
04:40:31.030 --> 04:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
here is our first step and we all are in
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
agreement everybody in the room
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
all these different people who never get
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
who never agree are all in support of
 
04:40:36.400 --> 04:40:37.430 align:start position:0%
who never agree are all in support of
this

04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:40:37.440 --> 04:40:38.310 align:start position:0%
this
um

04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't have to sort of haggle
 
04:40:41.110 --> 04:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
and haggle and haggle i do believe that
 
04:40:42.390 --> 04:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
we are close to that because there is
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
agreement it's just these details
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
can i just also say that like all of you
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
right everybody fights for space on our
 
04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
calendars and
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
we all give a priority to certain people
 
04:40:54.550 --> 04:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
and for me and certainly us at our
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
office they'll say well we have a
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
legislative committee meeting i've got
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
to go to that certainly would allow me
 
04:41:00.390 --> 04:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
or someone else to be like i'm not going
 
04:41:01.990 --> 04:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
to do those 10 other things you want me
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
to do and nobody's going to give me
 
04:41:03.280 --> 04:41:04.310 align:start position:0%
to do and nobody's going to give me
grief

04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
grief
 
04:41:06.550 --> 04:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
so i think it helps all of us
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
meet those and meet those requirements
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
like it does all of you
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
so i just throw that out
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
04:41:39.840 --> 04:41:41.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
committee

04:41:41.350 --> 04:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be before house
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
judiciary today for the record my name
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
is john dejoy i'm here representing the
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire psychological association
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
the hamster psychological association
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
represents psychologists across the
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased on their behalf to support
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
this important legislation
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
the psychological association respects
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
the breadth of stakeholders that are
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
listed in this legislation
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
one thing we note however is that there
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
are few clinicians
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
that are actually
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
represented in this list there are a
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
number of important people and for that
 
04:42:21.190 --> 04:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
reason we would request respectfully to
 
04:42:23.110 --> 04:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
add a
 
04:42:25.590 --> 04:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
forensic psychologist specifically i
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
understand dr bader is a forensic
 
04:42:27.680 --> 04:42:28.948 align:start position:0%
understand dr bader is a forensic
psychologist

04:42:28.948 --> 04:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
psychologist
 
04:42:30.550 --> 04:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
she's not a named member although i
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
suspect she will end up being a member
 
04:42:34.150 --> 04:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
of this and she should be
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
but we would ask that a forensic
 
04:42:36.480 --> 04:42:37.910 align:start position:0%
but we would ask that a forensic
psychologist

04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
psychologist
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
named by the new hampshire psychological
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
association be added to this
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
list and while it may seem unwieldy some
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
of the largest groups often end up with
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
some of the finest work
 
04:42:51.910 --> 04:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
before this legislature
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
i would refer the committee
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the test submitted testimony of dr
 
04:42:56.400 --> 04:42:57.590 align:start position:0%
to the test submitted testimony of dr
james

an opinion

as to
 
04:43:40.788 --> 04:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
whether um
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
we should
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
stick with the language in the original
 
04:43:45.440 --> 04:43:46.868 align:start position:0%
stick with the language in the original
bill

04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
which was to
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
create a commission
 
04:43:51.600 --> 04:43:52.868 align:start position:0%
create a commission
or

04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:43:54.230 --> 04:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you've seen the
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
amendments that senator sherman
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
submitted in which he suggests um
 
04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh an executive branch working group
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i as you
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
know i always have a number of opinions
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'm careful today to represent the
 
04:44:13.830 --> 04:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
opinions of new hampshire psychological
 
04:44:13.840 --> 04:44:15.030 align:start position:0%
opinions of new hampshire psychological
association

04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
what i would say in response to that is
 
04:44:17.200 --> 04:44:18.070 align:start position:0%
what i would say in response to that is
it's

04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
as and i've read briefly
 
04:44:24.070 --> 04:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
senator sherman's amendment
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
i was puzzled by while the legislature
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be directing the executive branch
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
to form this type of commission
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee when the executive branch is
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
fully capable of forming this committee
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
on their own without the legislature's
 
04:44:34.320 --> 04:44:35.590 align:start position:0%
on their own without the legislature's
input

04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
input
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the gravitas and i
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
heard your question before
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative i believe the gravitas of
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
the legislature is important in this
 
04:44:46.470 --> 04:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
which is why i would suggest that we
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
ought to stay with a commission
 
04:44:50.230 --> 04:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's interesting
 
04:44:50.240 --> 04:44:50.948 align:start position:0%
you know it's interesting
you

04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
several of you commented that you can't
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
make people do anything i think it's
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely true but when the legislature
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
speaks and forms a committee what i find
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
is you don't do anything to make people
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
be there
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
but you raise the bar where people are
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
afraid not to be there
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
people are always more afraid of what's
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
going to happen if they're not in the
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
room for that reason i think the
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
gravitas legislature makes this
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
commission valuable
 
04:45:17.350 --> 04:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
and it's why i'm here before you today
 
04:45:20.230 --> 04:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
representing nhpa asking that one of our
 
04:45:22.390 --> 04:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
members be added to the membership list
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
because we believe this will move
 
04:45:23.680 --> 04:45:24.708 align:start position:0%
because we believe this will move
forward

04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
and will produce as i said a fine work
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
see no one we will close the hearing on
 
04:45:50.070 --> 04:45:50.080 align:start position:0%

04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
we will move on to our next item of
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%

i'm here today to introduce senate bill
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
339 this bill exempts certain volunteer
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
boards at the new hampshire department
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
of safety from the physical quorum
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
requirements of rsa 91a while putting in
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
place measures to assure transparency
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
public access and participation
 
04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to name the boards in a second
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
but i want to make sure that i go on the
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
record saying that i did i worked on
 
04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
this bill in collaboration at the
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
request of the department of safety
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
i had the honor of serving as the chief
 
04:47:30.470 --> 04:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
of emergency medical services for the
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
department of safety and i worked with
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
these boards
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
and at that time so i left the
 
04:47:38.310 --> 04:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
department of safety in say 2010 so all
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
during the 2000s i would hear from
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers at all different levels
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
including you know volunteer emts
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
through to physicians who served in
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state that always
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know wanted to be on these
 
04:47:53.350 --> 04:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
boards as well as attend these meetings
 
04:47:55.110 --> 04:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
and couldn't leave their community
 
04:47:57.270 --> 04:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes for you know the day that it
 
04:47:59.350 --> 04:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
would take for them to be there to
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually serve so
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh i think one of the things we all
 
04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
learned during covet 19 is that
 
04:48:08.310 --> 04:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
in doing some of our business
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
virtually with putting you know the
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
necessary transparency and public access
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
requirements in place we saw
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
more public input
 
04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
but also we experienced and particularly
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
on these boards and a member of one of
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
these boards is here today to speak more
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
people were actually able to
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
attend the meetings and i'll talk about
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
why that's important in just a second
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
but briefly
 
04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
this addresses four different groups so
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
one is the fire standards and training
 
04:48:34.400 --> 04:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
one is the fire standards and training
commission

04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
that's established under rsa 21p25
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
the emergency medical and trauma
 
04:48:43.190 --> 04:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
services coordinating board got the
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
department of safety which is
 
04:48:47.830 --> 04:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
established under rsa 153 a3
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%

04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
control board at the department of
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
safety which is established under 153 a5
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
and the trauma systems trauma medical
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
review committee which is also at the
 
04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
department of safety under 153
 
04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
a8 each of these boards
 
04:49:07.670 --> 04:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
dedicates hundreds of hours to assure
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
that emergency medical services and fire
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
organizations in new hampshire are
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
practicing and delivering services that
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
meet the highest standards each
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer member sacrifices time away
 
04:49:20.708 --> 04:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
from work time away from home and many
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
travel from the furthest reaches in new
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire in order to be sure that
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
decisions are made with input from all
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
geographic locations
 
04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
and again during my time as the chief
 
04:49:34.230 --> 04:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
although we did have representation from
 
04:49:36.070 --> 04:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
these different geographic rep
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
geographic locations
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
they need to be named to these groups
 
04:49:41.910 --> 04:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
but they couldn't always again get away
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
from their their hospitals or their
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and they would ask
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
about this and then it seemed so foreign
 
04:49:49.830 --> 04:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
but now it's almost so regular and
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's why this was
 
04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
a specific request to come forward
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
now by allowing these exemptions i
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
believe that we will increase the number
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
of volunteers from the most diverse
 
04:50:02.550 --> 04:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
locations in new hampshire that will be
 
04:50:04.868 --> 04:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
able to serve increase the likelihood
 
04:50:06.788 --> 04:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
that these volunteers will serve more
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
than one term and increase the input
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
from the public and the disciplines that
 
04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
these boards serve i'd like to note in
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
terms of serving more than one term
 
04:50:18.310 --> 04:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
there are term limits for each of these
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
positions they're i don't believe
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
they're for the medical control board
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
but there are for all of the other no
 
04:50:24.150 --> 04:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
there is for the medical control board
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
now so they all have term limits but
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
what we have seen happen and it happened
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
during my tenure is it was such a huge
 
04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
commitment and when it required travel
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
from you know close to the canadian
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
border to represent the emts from that
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
area or sometimes even down on the you
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
know we think of the seacoast as being
 
04:50:40.868 --> 04:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
close by more metropolitan but still
 
04:50:42.868 --> 04:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
when somebody has to is volunteering and
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
traveling and coming in to work on um
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
these different on one of these
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
different boards it becomes you know a a
 
04:50:51.910 --> 04:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
day-long plus commitment so in order to
 
04:50:53.670 --> 04:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
get them to serve for more than one term
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
to present provide some consistency and
 
04:50:57.430 --> 04:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
in policy making
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
i think that this again is a real step
 
04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
in the right direction
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
so during the senate uh when we heard
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
this was heard in house and senate
 
04:51:04.480 --> 04:51:05.750 align:start position:0%
this was heard in house and senate
judiciary

04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
judiciary
 
04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
we there were some concerns that were
 
04:51:10.868 --> 04:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
raised um about you know the
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
basically the 91a requirements and i
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
that although in my mind
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
this would cover that these would be
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
covered i thought that it was important
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
to take the same steps that we took
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic for how these
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
meetings were conducted so that it was
 
04:51:30.628 --> 04:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
the express transparency was there
 
04:51:30.638 --> 04:51:31.350 align:start position:0%
the express transparency was there
so

04:51:31.350 --> 04:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is now amended and it includes
 
04:51:36.868 --> 04:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
a physical location so if people can
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
come to a meeting we're not expecting
 
04:51:39.910 --> 04:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
that these meetings will come completely
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
virtual but folks that can come to a
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
meeting will be in a physical location
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
but it could be opened up to people
 
04:51:47.830 --> 04:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
outside who are members of these boards
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
as well as members of the public who
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
want to have input it requires public
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
notice of meetings it requires public
 
04:51:56.708 --> 04:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
access for participation it requires
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
that minutes be taken and posted for
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
public review on the department of
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
safety's website and it also has the it
 
04:52:05.830 --> 04:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
requires a roll call vote if there is
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
any type of policy decision made say the
 
04:52:09.830 --> 04:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
updating of a patient care protocol
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
again for the highest standards of care
 
04:52:14.708 --> 04:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
that are available that we're we really
 
04:52:17.590 --> 04:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we keep
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
the public care and the public trust
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
front and center here
 
04:52:24.150 --> 04:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
so considering again my time working
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
with these boards which again i was
 
04:52:27.670 --> 04:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
really honored to serve in that role i
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
can think of very little that any member
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
has ever asked for
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's time we honor the work of those who
 
04:52:36.868 --> 04:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
have served in the past those serving
 
04:52:38.550 --> 04:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
now and those in the future
 
04:52:41.190 --> 04:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
with making these changes so uh with
 
04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
that i'd um
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'd ask for certainly an ought to pass
 
04:52:47.990 --> 04:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation i'm happy to answer any
 
04:52:50.470 --> 04:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
questions you might have and if i don't
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator yes
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you right now
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
so the meeting place is the department
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
of safety here in concord is that where
 
04:53:06.150 --> 04:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
everybody tries and how often are those
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
held every other month so it's six times
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
a year
 
04:53:09.360 --> 04:53:11.590 align:start position:0%
a year
uh

04:53:11.590 --> 04:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's six times a year for the medical
 
04:53:16.470 --> 04:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
boards the fire student training
 
04:53:19.590 --> 04:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
commission i believe they meet monthly
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
and they do travel in
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
there was a period of time when i worked
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
at safety where we did take these
 
04:53:29.030 --> 04:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
meetings on the road but it became
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
really complicated in doing that when
 
04:53:32.708 --> 04:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
you're trying to notify the public for
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
this meeting we'll be now at this
 
04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
location so we just reconsolidated back
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
so at least six times a year for the
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
medical boards and um 12 times a year
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
for the fire standards and training
 
04:53:43.280 --> 04:53:44.948 align:start position:0%
for the fire standards and training
commission

04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:53.190 --> 04:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:55.030 --> 04:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
during the past two years i've been to
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
many zoo meetings youtube
 
04:54:03.120 --> 04:54:04.868 align:start position:0%
many zoo meetings youtube
everything

04:54:04.868 --> 04:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:54:08.550 --> 04:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
one of my biggest drawbacks
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
is the youtube might not work you can't
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
hear the meeting and this happened more
 
04:54:14.550 --> 04:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
than once
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
on a zoo meeting the people do not that
 
04:54:18.000 --> 04:54:18.868 align:start position:0%
on a zoo meeting the people do not that
are

04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in the room conducting
 
04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
they do not get close enough to the mic
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
so you can't hear them half the time
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's my biggest drawback how do we
 
04:54:32.550 --> 04:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
solve it
 
04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
i believe that uh
 
04:54:36.788 --> 04:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative andrus for
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
the question and so on page two
 
04:54:43.510 --> 04:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
of this and this is actually part of i i
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
skipped over this but was part of how we
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
amended it in the senate it provides a
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the public to alert the
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
public body during the meeting if there
 
04:54:55.270 --> 04:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
are problems with access so
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
certainly i've attended more virtual
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
meetings um in the last two years and
 
04:55:00.628 --> 04:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
even before that i worked in a remote
 
04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
position for a group called the american
 
04:55:04.470 --> 04:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
trauma society which supports supports
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
trauma centers throughout the country as
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
well as as here in in new hampshire so i
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
have a lot of experience working in the
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
virtual setting and by having that
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place where there's a
 
04:55:16.150 --> 04:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's a notice for how to alert those
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
that are controlling the meeting that
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
there is a problem or that you you know
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
which includes maybe they can't get into
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
the room maybe they they're not being
 
04:55:23.920 --> 04:55:24.788 align:start position:0%
the room maybe they they're not being
heard

04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:55:26.070 --> 04:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
there's a you know they're not close
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
enough to the microphone there is a way
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
to have that conversation so there's a
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
phone number or a web
 
04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
connection that they can make right away
 
04:55:37.510 --> 04:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
outside of that virtual connection to
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
say there's a problem with this meeting
 
04:55:42.470 --> 04:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much mr
 
04:55:48.390 --> 04:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much senator
 
04:55:48.400 --> 04:55:50.550 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much senator
um

04:55:50.550 --> 04:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
i'm reading um
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
especially paragraph four and page two
 
04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of it looks like
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
this bill only guarantees the general
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
public uh basically telephone or
 
04:56:03.120 --> 04:56:04.070 align:start position:0%
public uh basically telephone or
um

04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:05.910 --> 04:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
video streaming access to the meeting so
 
04:56:07.270 --> 04:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
they don't guarantee
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
the general public the opportunity to
 
04:56:09.600 --> 04:56:10.788 align:start position:0%
the general public the opportunity to
actually

04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
be in the room and i think probably
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
probably our case especially if they're
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
meeting the department of safety under
 
04:56:18.470 --> 04:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances where the
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
environment safety might want to limit
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
how many random people for the public
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
are physically in their facilities so
 
04:56:24.480 --> 04:56:25.190 align:start position:0%
are physically in their facilities so
that's

04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
this but is this intended to
 
04:56:30.070 --> 04:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
guarantee all meetings in person access
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
or you're only going so far is to grant
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
them video or telephone access
 
04:56:38.550 --> 04:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
without virtual act so thank you i'm
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative morgan and i think i've
 
04:56:41.350 --> 04:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
seen you three times today so good to
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
see you again well good to see you then
 
04:56:44.868 --> 04:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
so this uh this is a great time of year
 
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
we get to all see each other and so um i
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate this opportunity to
 
04:56:51.670 --> 04:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
be here in person versus virtual but
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
during a time when we needed to do that
 
04:56:55.110 --> 04:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we did so to answer your
 
04:56:57.750 --> 04:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
question if we didn't even have this all
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
these folks would have to be in person
 
04:57:01.430 --> 04:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
by doing this
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
and if language needs to be i'm
 
04:57:05.750 --> 04:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
clarified i'm happy to do that it says
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
virtual which allows for
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
any you know any
 
04:57:14.550 --> 04:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's by zoom
 
04:57:14.560 --> 04:57:15.830 align:start position:0%
whether it's by zoom
youtube

04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
youtube
 
04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
however it's going to be broadcast it's
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
a virtual platform
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's not been my experience
 
04:57:23.430 --> 04:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
when i worked there that we limited the
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
number of of people in the room unless
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know there's an occupant so some of
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
this comes down to the local fire
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
departments and stuff there's a
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
certificate that says how many people
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
can be there so that includes the
 
04:57:36.550 --> 04:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
buildings at the fire academy in concord
 
04:57:38.708 --> 04:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
so if they were to go over that you know
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
then it would have to be what i would
 
04:57:42.150 --> 04:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
say marshalled
 
04:57:46.230 --> 04:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:51.430 --> 04:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
i guess the the question
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
that i'm
 
04:57:55.990 --> 04:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
wrestling with is um
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
we have this bill we've had a bill
 
04:57:59.910 --> 04:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
earlier today with regard allowing
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
particular groups to have remote
 
04:58:01.520 --> 04:58:02.868 align:start position:0%
particular groups to have remote
meetings

04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:58:04.550 --> 04:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
we had bills
 
04:58:07.510 --> 04:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
last year with regard to specialized
 
04:58:07.520 --> 04:58:09.590 align:start position:0%
last year with regard to specialized
groups

04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
groups
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
or earlier this year with regard to have
 
04:58:14.310 --> 04:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
specialized groups having
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
an exception for remote meetings
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
the issue that i'm having is shouldn't
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
we as a state be adopting a
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
policy rather than doing a onesies and
 
04:58:27.270 --> 04:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
twozies for individual groups
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we have or be adopting an
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
overall policy with regard to remote
 
04:58:32.160 --> 04:58:34.070 align:start position:0%
overall policy with regard to remote
meetings

04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:58:35.830 --> 04:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair gordon i couldn't agree
 
04:58:35.840 --> 04:58:37.750 align:start position:0%
thank you chair gordon i couldn't agree
more

04:58:37.750 --> 04:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:58:40.830 --> 04:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
but in when i filed this bill there was
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
not there was didn't seem to be an
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
appetite for moving in that direction
 
04:58:49.590 --> 04:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
and so what i did take was a step to
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i know that others did it this way
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
too to take these particular boards and
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
get them
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
hopefully across the finish line but i
 
04:58:58.708 --> 04:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
think our larger goal needs to be that
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
we have to revisit the entire
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
conversation so i couldn't agree with
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
you more but in
 
04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
there didn't seem to be an appetite for
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
something that was more broad
 
04:59:11.350 --> 04:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
that involved state the state and state
 
04:59:14.390 --> 04:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
boards so i narrowed my focus
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason why i did it this
 
04:59:18.550 --> 04:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
way but i would be open and happy to you
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
know work on that on that type of
 
04:59:20.160 --> 04:59:21.670 align:start position:0%
know work on that on that type of
legislation

04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:59:24.310 --> 04:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome understandable
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:29.590 --> 04:59:29.600 align:start position:0%

dartmouth tishkaka medical center i'm
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%

04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%

05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
the chair of the tmrc the trauma medical
 
05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
review committee
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
in support of the spill i feel excuse me
 
05:00:06.638 --> 05:00:07.430 align:start position:0%
in support of the spill i feel excuse me
for

05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
some background i can only speak to our
 
05:00:10.550 --> 05:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee i've been a member for a long
 
05:00:14.070 --> 05:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
time um we are assigned the task of
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining the trauma system within the
 
05:00:15.840 --> 05:00:16.788 align:start position:0%
maintaining the trauma system within the
state

05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
by doing that we focus on the four
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
concepts of the pre-hospital care the
 
05:00:22.550 --> 05:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
hospital care itself with the donations
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
of hospitals
 
05:00:26.550 --> 05:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
the rehab part of this as well as injury
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
prevention so our meetings encounter
 
05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
encompass all these groups they all
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
provide information and allows not only
 
05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
the committee members but the public to
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
ask questions
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's a
 
05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
great group that does this as senator
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
princess has said on their own time
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
we underwent a state review or a review
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
of our state's trauma system by the
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
american college of surgeons several
 
05:00:51.590 --> 05:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and one of the things that
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
they were impressed by was the
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
equality of the trauma system that we
 
05:00:57.430 --> 05:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
have and impressed by the fact that the
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
majority of this is done by volunteers
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
but caution against the longevity of
 
05:01:01.520 --> 05:01:02.470 align:start position:0%
but caution against the longevity of
that

05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
because people's time is harder and
 
05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
harder to come up
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
i think senator apprentice has mentioned
 
05:01:09.190 --> 05:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
this has been a challenge
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic we do outreach we do
 
05:01:13.750 --> 05:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
education throughout the state
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
and every time you go to a small
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
hospital they are interested they're
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
engaged but trauma is a small part we
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
were in cobra class july great people
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful facilities
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
they are very engaged but it's very
 
05:01:27.670 --> 05:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
difficult for one person who wears many
 
05:01:29.350 --> 05:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
hats to leave their institution for a
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
day to drive down even if it's only
 
05:01:32.708 --> 05:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
every other month
 
05:01:34.470 --> 05:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think this is
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic has
 
05:01:37.830 --> 05:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
broadened our abilities to engage and
 
05:01:39.750 --> 05:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
capture more people
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
but i
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
i agree with everyone that there needs
 
05:01:45.750 --> 05:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
to be a physical location i personally
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
feel it's much easier to have
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
conversations and engage and interact
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
with the physical location i think
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
having that as an option
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
is is very important
 
05:01:56.310 --> 05:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
but we missed three of our meetings last
 
05:01:57.910 --> 05:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
year because we couldn't get a quorum
 
05:01:59.830 --> 05:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we only need nine people
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
people have gotten very used to
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
scheduling their time such that they can
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
block off an hour and a half for a
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
meeting but it's very difficult to know
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
kind of go back two years to where you
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
had your half half your day open or your
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
whole day open so i think
 
05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
our group is such that everyone is
 
05:02:17.590 --> 05:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
engaged and the key players will
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
continue to want to come but it does
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
allow for that option to say
 
05:02:22.310 --> 05:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know we need one more person to
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
attend i have a quorum can someone call
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
in and just be a part of that meeting
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that would be helpful to
 
05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
allow us to sort of move forward and
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
focus our efforts
 
05:02:32.708 --> 05:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
you know i do appreciate that having a
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
physical location our meetings are i
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
believe we have 17 voting members
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
but we routinely have 50 or 60 people in
 
05:02:44.070 --> 05:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
the room and those those public members
 
05:02:45.750 --> 05:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
tend to be people who are engaged in
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
medical care but they are public members
 
05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
and many of those non-voting public
 
05:02:52.470 --> 05:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
members provide a lot of the services
 
05:02:55.270 --> 05:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
that we do such as the designations so i
 
05:02:57.030 --> 05:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
think we've never had a situation and i
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
would welcome the situation that we had
 
05:03:01.030 --> 05:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know not enough room in our rooms uh
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
we've never had a standing room only
 
05:03:05.190 --> 05:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
crowd i would love that but i think
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
space has not been a challenge in the
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
close to a decade that i've been part of
 
05:03:11.670 --> 05:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:11.680 --> 05:03:12.948 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative chase
 
05:03:17.110 --> 05:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
05:03:18.550 --> 05:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
so tell me
 
05:03:20.550 --> 05:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
if you when you're having your meetings
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
you said that you had missed three
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
meetings this year
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and because you didn't have a quorum so
 
05:03:28.628 --> 05:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
what happens what is it that you are
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
trying to vote on and does it get
 
05:03:32.948 --> 05:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
curtailed and tabled to the next meeting
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
um so when our meetings we have
 
05:03:36.150 --> 05:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that often meet at the
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
same time so the subcommittees are
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for designating state
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals they're responsible for
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
working on the pre-hospital care and our
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
education subcommittee which
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
is trying to more and more work on
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
outreach so i feel
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
the the last meeting we had in person i
 
05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
was finally able to get caught up but i
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
almost feel like i have lost a year
 
05:03:57.030 --> 05:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
because it's difficult when you meet
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
every other month to sort of keep the
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
momentum going but if you missed two in
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
a row which unfortunately we have it was
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult to sort of get back to
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
where we were trying to go
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
our efforts the past several years have
 
05:04:09.510 --> 05:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
been there are 26 hospitals within the
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
state only 11 of those are designated
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
but everybody really is participating in
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
the acute care of injured patients
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
so our goal is to
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
engage every facility at some level um
 
05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
and we've been working in that direction
 
05:04:25.830 --> 05:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
to sort of change how we're utilizing
 
05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
our resources but that does take
 
05:04:29.590 --> 05:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee votes and
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's just has sort of stalled and we've
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:42.550 --> 05:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative maclean
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question um on the second page
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph four says that a physical
 
05:04:49.360 --> 05:04:50.628 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph four says that a physical
location

05:04:50.628 --> 05:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
location
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
is required um but it doesn't require
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
that any member of the board actually be
 
05:04:59.110 --> 05:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
there so while you might have a physical
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
location it would allow literally um for
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
nobody to physically show up to to
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
interact um with the folks of the
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
community that might be there do you
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
have any particular thoughts on that i
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
do and and i do feel that
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
again i i can talk to senator brentus
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
about this i don't want to change her
 
05:05:22.230 --> 05:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
her language um but i feel that
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
like most things 100 of achieving even
 
05:05:26.550 --> 05:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
six meetings a year can be challenging
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
everybody has problems even if you
 
05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
have a requirement of
 
05:05:31.750 --> 05:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the meetings have to be in
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
person or something i can do all i want
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
to encourage people to attend in person
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
as the chair but if the language is such
 
05:05:41.350 --> 05:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
that they could all attend remotely
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
i guess there's nothing that would stop
 
05:05:44.948 --> 05:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
that direction i do know that many of
 
05:05:46.628 --> 05:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
the attendees the volunteers and the
 
05:05:48.550 --> 05:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
voting members use this as a
 
05:05:48.560 --> 05:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
voting members use this as a
a

05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
time to sort of resource with each other
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that physical contact has
 
05:05:56.948 --> 05:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
been a strong suit of this
 
05:05:58.150 --> 05:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
05:06:00.310 --> 05:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
i would consider that i suspect that was
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
so going forward but i i share your
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
concerns as well you know we don't know
 
05:06:04.948 --> 05:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
what will happen in five years and if
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
there's some language that suggests that
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
the majority of the meetings must be in
 
05:06:10.628 --> 05:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
person as a voting member
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
that at least brings that core there
 
05:06:12.160 --> 05:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
that at least brings that core there
routinely

05:06:13.990 --> 05:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
again that's just me i'm not speaking
 
05:06:17.830 --> 05:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
for center apprentice on that one
 
05:06:19.830 --> 05:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:19.840 --> 05:06:21.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for taking
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
my question dr mark you articulated
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
something very well you said
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
i feel it but you i think you said
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
people are getting used to spending 90
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
minutes on something instead of a half
 
05:06:34.638 --> 05:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
minutes on something instead of a half
day

05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering for you when you're
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
participating in a virtual meeting are
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
you less engaged or less likely to
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
follow up with people that may have
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
questions or do you notice with your
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues on boards that they're less
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
committed to their service on that board
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic i hadn't noticed
 
05:06:55.030 --> 05:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
that at all i think everyone is just as
 
05:06:56.628 --> 05:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
engaged on the meeting i think there are
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
some technological challenges even still
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
two years into this
 
05:07:03.510 --> 05:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
um but i felt like the work that was
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
being done during those meetings was
 
05:07:07.270 --> 05:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
still effective i think it allowed for
 
05:07:07.280 --> 05:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
still effective i think it allowed for
some

05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
some growth in some ways to be able to
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
do that without otherwise we would have
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
done nothing for for a long period of
 
05:07:14.958 --> 05:07:15.910 align:start position:0%
done nothing for for a long period of
time

05:07:15.910 --> 05:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
but i didn't get the sense that people
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
were less engaged i feel the the key
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
point is having an ability for people to
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
raise their hand electronically or ask
 
05:07:27.750 --> 05:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions is is you have to have that
 
05:07:29.830 --> 05:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
you can't have a public meeting or any
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
meeting without the ability for people
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
to speak up
 
05:07:35.830 --> 05:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you dr martin thank you chair
 
05:07:35.840 --> 05:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
thank you dr martin thank you chair
gordon

05:07:37.510 --> 05:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
gordon
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:43.990 --> 05:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
just following up on what representative
 
05:07:45.670 --> 05:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
mclean had asked
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
do you see would you have any objection
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
if there was a requirement that the
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
chairperson of a meeting be at the
 
05:07:54.550 --> 05:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
physical location
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
i would not although i did miss the
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
december meeting for being for reasons
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
that i could not our hospital was being
 
05:08:01.270 --> 05:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the american college surgeon
 
05:08:03.430 --> 05:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
so that was one meeting i could not make
 
05:08:05.670 --> 05:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
um so i think
 
05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to have the language that
 
05:08:08.550 --> 05:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
either the chair or the vice chair
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
should be present in person i think that
 
05:08:12.788 --> 05:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
would allow for for some leniency
 
05:08:12.798 --> 05:08:13.670 align:start position:0%
would allow for for some leniency
because

05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
when you miss one meeting a year that's
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
a lot so if we were to say the presiding
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
officer the cardinals i think that's a
 
05:08:20.000 --> 05:08:21.590 align:start position:0%
officer the cardinals i think that's a
reasonable

05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable ask so if the public is there
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
05:08:27.030 --> 05:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
someone to
 
05:08:30.230 --> 05:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
address exactly
 
05:08:32.070 --> 05:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today thank you for
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who
 
05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
would like to address the committee with
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
seeing nolan we will close the hearing
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%

for the record i'm senator rebecca
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
perkins quoca from senate district 21
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
representing portsmouth in the towns of

madbury lee durham newington newmarket
 
05:42:40.470 --> 05:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
in newfields
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of sb217 relative to
 
05:42:45.750 --> 05:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
eviction notices
 
05:42:48.310 --> 05:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
sb 217 is a piece of legislation that i
 
05:42:50.070 --> 05:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
worked on with elliot berry from new
 
05:42:52.470 --> 05:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire legal assistance
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
as amended this bill will expand the
 
05:42:57.910 --> 05:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
minimum minimum amount of notice needed
 
05:43:01.030 --> 05:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
for a renovation eviction from 30 days
 
05:43:02.708 --> 05:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
to 60 days
 
05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
in such a tight housing market with
 
05:43:07.750 --> 05:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates hovering between 0.5 and 1
 
05:43:09.510 --> 05:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
around the entire state
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
it can be next to impossible to find
 
05:43:12.948 --> 05:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
housing in 30 days with the threat of an
 
05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
eviction hanging over your head
 
05:43:17.430 --> 05:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to provide a cause
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
of action for tenants in cases where a
 
05:43:20.788 --> 05:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
landlord indicates the eviction is for
 
05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
the purpose of renovating but does not
 
05:43:25.030 --> 05:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
in fact pursue any renovations this is
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
clearly not every landlord in new
 
05:43:28.310 --> 05:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are lucky to have small
 
05:43:30.150 --> 05:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
local landlords and everyone has an
 
05:43:33.190 --> 05:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
interest in preserving that
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to provide some
 
05:43:36.948 --> 05:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
remedy to the tenant
 
05:43:39.190 --> 05:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
who is evicted under other good cause
 
05:43:42.070 --> 05:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
leaving them little recourse
 
05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
i hope that this bill will give
 
05:43:44.948 --> 05:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
individuals and families already facing
 
05:43:46.948 --> 05:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
a dire situation just a little bit more
 
05:43:48.788 --> 05:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
time in which they could either find a
 
05:43:50.788 --> 05:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
new place to live or find assistance to
 
05:43:52.470 --> 05:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
help them catch up on any potentially
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
late payments
 
05:43:55.510 --> 05:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
or find another avenue for resolving
 
05:43:57.670 --> 05:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
their conflict of the landlord we all
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
know that the lack of long-term housing
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
supply is the real underlying problem
 
05:44:04.150 --> 05:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
and one i have personally been working
 
05:44:06.070 --> 05:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
on for over a decade
 
05:44:08.708 --> 05:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
in the short term however over 50
 
05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
percent of our renters were affected by
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
covert related job loss and we need to
 
05:44:14.628 --> 05:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
continue to ensure that we do everything
 
05:44:17.430 --> 05:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
we can to make our housing market fair
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
sb 217 passed at a center commerce with
 
05:44:23.030 --> 05:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
the unanimous recommendation and passed
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
the full senate on a voice vote
 
05:44:27.750 --> 05:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll leave it
 
05:44:29.350 --> 05:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
there and i'd be happy to answer any
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
 
05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
05:44:35.430 --> 05:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
senator as i read this
 
05:44:43.750 --> 05:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm obviously missing something
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
the evictions here
 
05:44:49.510 --> 05:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with non-payment of
 
05:44:52.948 --> 05:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
rent they have to do with
 
05:44:55.350 --> 05:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances that
 
05:44:57.910 --> 05:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
where the landlord
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
desires repairs or is required to make
 
05:45:03.430 --> 05:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
repairs etc etc etc and yet you alluded
 
05:45:03.440 --> 05:45:04.548 align:start position:0%
repairs etc etc etc and yet you alluded
to

05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:45:06.628 --> 05:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
non-payment so can you help me
 
05:45:08.470 --> 05:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
understand that thank you thank you
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative for the opportunity to
 
05:45:11.750 --> 05:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
clarify that that was included in my
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
statement um
 
05:45:15.270 --> 05:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
you're you are correct to read the
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
language of the bill to
 
05:45:20.070 --> 05:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
address the limited circumstances where
 
05:45:20.080 --> 05:45:21.190 align:start position:0%
address the limited circumstances where
um

05:45:21.190 --> 05:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:23.590 --> 05:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
we we're inserting
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
um into rsa 542 roman numeral to you
 
05:45:29.910 --> 05:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
know paragraph h which does address the
 
05:45:31.590 --> 05:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances you're talking
 
05:45:33.750 --> 05:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
about when the landlord desires to
 
05:45:35.910 --> 05:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
perform repairs the dwelling unit with
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
when the tenant cannot safely be in
 
05:45:37.840 --> 05:45:38.628 align:start position:0%
when the tenant cannot safely be in
there

05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
perform a substantial renovation or to
 
05:45:40.798 --> 05:45:41.830 align:start position:0%
perform a substantial renovation or to
sell

05:45:41.830 --> 05:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
sell
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
in those specific cases um
 
05:45:47.590 --> 05:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
the 60-day notice is then inserted in
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph two
 
05:45:51.910 --> 05:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
with certain exceptions so my apologies
 
05:45:54.150 --> 05:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
for that being included in my
 
05:45:58.230 --> 05:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
other questions for the senator
 
05:46:01.510 --> 05:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
05:46:03.270 --> 05:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
05:46:05.430 --> 05:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question this is more
 
05:46:06.868 --> 05:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking of bills that we've
 
05:46:08.310 --> 05:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
had already
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
and i i could be
 
05:46:14.948 --> 05:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
trying to pull from my memory it might
 
05:46:17.750 --> 05:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
have been a lead paint removal but he
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
had one where um you know landlord has
 
05:46:21.990 --> 05:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
been ordered to make the repairs and
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
then has to put the tenant in a
 
05:46:27.910 --> 05:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
different dwelling uh whether it be
 
05:46:29.910 --> 05:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
say a motel or something short term
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
until the repairs are done and then that
 
05:46:33.910 --> 05:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
person would be able to go back to the
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
housing is this not
 
05:46:39.910 --> 05:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
at all considered in the spill
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you're leading line 12 actually
 
05:46:43.200 --> 05:46:44.628 align:start position:0%
yeah you're leading line 12 actually
yep

05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:46:46.708 --> 05:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
so if you come further down
 
05:46:46.718 --> 05:46:47.750 align:start position:0%
so if you come further down
yeah

05:46:47.750 --> 05:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:46:50.390 --> 05:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
05:46:51.910 --> 05:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you senator thank you
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:47:06.470 --> 05:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:08.310 --> 05:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
elliot berry i'm a
 
05:47:13.510 --> 05:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
an attorney at new hampshire legal
 
05:47:15.430 --> 05:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
assistance and the director of our
 
05:47:17.430 --> 05:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
housing justice project i've been
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
representing tenants in new hampshire
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years and for some of you
 
05:47:22.868 --> 05:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
you probably feel like i've been coming
 
05:47:26.830 --> 05:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:30.150 --> 05:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
um i think i've been here enough so that
 
05:47:32.868 --> 05:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
you probably know what an incredible
 
05:47:35.830 --> 05:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
shortage we have today of housing that
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
certainly even middle-income people uh
 
05:47:40.948 --> 05:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
can afford and certainly
 
05:47:40.958 --> 05:47:41.910 align:start position:0%
can afford and certainly
yet

05:47:41.910 --> 05:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
yet
 
05:47:43.830 --> 05:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
in rental housing it's absolutely the
 
05:47:46.230 --> 05:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
worst situation i've seen
 
05:47:49.510 --> 05:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
in my 40-plus years here the median rent
 
05:47:52.470 --> 05:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
for a two-bedroom apartment is just shy
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
two dollars shy of fifteen hundred
 
05:47:58.310 --> 05:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
dollars and a vacancy rate statewide of
 
05:48:00.788 --> 05:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
less than one percent
 
05:48:03.270 --> 05:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
so at the same time
 
05:48:05.830 --> 05:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're in this market we have seen
 
05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
a major major spike in evictions
 
05:48:12.310 --> 05:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
where the reason is that the landlord
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
wants to renovate the property or that
 
05:48:17.190 --> 05:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
the landlord wants to sell the property
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the problem look is that in these
 
05:48:19.680 --> 05:48:20.788 align:start position:0%
and the problem look is that in these
cases

05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:48:23.430 --> 05:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
the tenant is in no way at fault
 
05:48:23.440 --> 05:48:24.948 align:start position:0%
the tenant is in no way at fault
whatsoever

05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
05:48:28.310 --> 05:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
but in this market
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
they may very well end up homeless after
 
05:48:32.548 --> 05:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
living in a place especially i have a
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
lot of elderly clients who have lived in
 
05:48:36.708 --> 05:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
their apartments for you know 10 years
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
or more and the new landlord comes and i
 
05:48:41.190 --> 05:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
get it he you know wants to renovate the
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
properties but it should these folks
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
really be threatened with homelessness
 
05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
remember that for elderly housing the
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
wait lists are
 
05:48:50.400 --> 05:48:51.430 align:start position:0%
wait lists are
minimum

05:48:51.430 --> 05:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
05:48:54.390 --> 05:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh a year and a half for section 8 where
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
you have a subsidy that you can use in
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
the private market you're talking about
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
wait lists of five to ten years
 
05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
so people just have nowhere to go
 
05:49:06.480 --> 05:49:07.750 align:start position:0%
so people just have nowhere to go
um

05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i will say that again that this
 
05:49:12.310 --> 05:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
market is the worst that i've seen
 
05:49:13.990 --> 05:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
but i want to be really clear with you
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
we have never had enough rental housing
 
05:49:19.190 --> 05:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
that at prices that lower income people
 
05:49:20.390 --> 05:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
can afford
 
05:49:23.030 --> 05:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
in my entire career here except during
 
05:49:24.628 --> 05:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
the savings and loan
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh meltdown and then around 1990 and the
 
05:49:30.788 --> 05:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
great recession in 2007 but other than
 
05:49:33.670 --> 05:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
that the market is just
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
usually hostile to the people who need
 
05:49:36.558 --> 05:49:37.590 align:start position:0%
usually hostile to the people who need
housing

05:49:37.590 --> 05:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
and can't afford it
 
05:49:41.430 --> 05:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh i wanna
 
05:49:44.390 --> 05:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
i wanna stress and this is really very
 
05:49:44.400 --> 05:49:46.628 align:start position:0%
i wanna stress and this is really very
important

05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is not about bad landlords it's not
 
05:49:52.948 --> 05:49:52.958 align:start position:0%
about punishing any anybody it's simply
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
about giving people a little more
 
05:49:57.990 --> 05:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
protection a little more time
 
05:50:00.788 --> 05:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
so that that extra day or an extra week
 
05:50:03.830 --> 05:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
or an extra month might enable them
 
05:50:05.830 --> 05:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
05:50:08.070 --> 05:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
going to a homeless shelter or moving in
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
with people who don't you know with
 
05:50:10.320 --> 05:50:11.510 align:start position:0%
with people who don't you know with
relatives

05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
relatives
 
05:50:11.520 --> 05:50:13.190 align:start position:0%
relatives
um

05:50:13.190 --> 05:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:16.470 --> 05:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
you need to understand that this only
 
05:50:19.750 --> 05:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
applies to what the law currently calls
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
restricted housing and what that means
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
is if you're renting out your
 
05:50:26.708 --> 05:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
single-family home and you don't own
 
05:50:29.190 --> 05:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
more than three at any one time
 
05:50:32.788 --> 05:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
you're not affected by this bill at all
 
05:50:36.150 --> 05:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
it if you live in a building an owner i
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
that you own and you have three rental
 
05:50:41.590 --> 05:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
units or less in that building
 
05:50:44.788 --> 05:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
this bill does not have any effect on
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
you whatsoever
 
05:50:48.708 --> 05:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
for the bankers in the crowd
 
05:50:48.718 --> 05:50:49.510 align:start position:0%
for the bankers in the crowd
more

05:50:49.510 --> 05:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:50:52.470 --> 05:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
properties at mortgage foreclosure
 
05:50:54.788 --> 05:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
are also exempt and this is not new
 
05:50:56.868 --> 05:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
exemptions this exemption in the current
 
05:50:56.878 --> 05:50:57.750 align:start position:0%
exemptions this exemption in the current
law

05:50:57.750 --> 05:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
in the definitions of restricted housing
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
so what does the bill do simply it says
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
the eviction notice it's required
 
05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
when you give somebody when the reason
 
05:51:10.548 --> 05:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
for the eviction
 
05:51:14.070 --> 05:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
is rehab of the building or sale of the
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
building it simply extends the eviction
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
notice from 30 to 60 days
 
05:51:19.840 --> 05:51:20.948 align:start position:0%
notice from 30 to 60 days
um

05:51:20.948 --> 05:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
the senate by voice vote passed an
 
05:51:25.990 --> 05:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
amendment we had submitted the bill at
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
90 but i can't stress to you i just had
 
05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
a client who i made an arrangement for
 
05:51:34.708 --> 05:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
um to get her about three and a half
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
months to move after she had gotten been
 
05:51:38.868 --> 05:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
in court for the eviction
 
05:51:42.548 --> 05:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
for three when she got within two weeks
 
05:51:45.910 --> 05:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
two weeks of her deadline drop dead date
 
05:51:48.390 --> 05:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
she's still peppering me with emails she
 
05:51:51.590 --> 05:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
has absolutely nowhere to go finally in
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
the last week she got a break and she
 
05:51:56.708 --> 05:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
was able to move but i guess what i'm
 
05:51:59.910 --> 05:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
trying to tell you here is yes
 
05:52:01.670 --> 05:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
there is no question
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
that this will make landlords of
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
restricted property they it will maybe
 
05:52:09.750 --> 05:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
lengthen the time it will take them to
 
05:52:12.948 --> 05:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
do rehab or to sell a place but what i
 
05:52:14.390 --> 05:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
beg you to do
 
05:52:17.110 --> 05:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
is to consider balancing the harms on
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
the one hand you have people who are
 
05:52:21.030 --> 05:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
being evicted to no fault of their own
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
who are facing the imminent possibility
 
05:52:25.830 --> 05:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
of homelessness and on the other hand
 
05:52:28.788 --> 05:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
you have investors in
 
05:52:28.798 --> 05:52:29.910 align:start position:0%
you have investors in
landlords

05:52:29.910 --> 05:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
05:52:29.920 --> 05:52:30.868 align:start position:0%
landlords
who

05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
simply you know who want to renovate and
 
05:52:35.190 --> 05:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
rehab their property
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
but where it you know if you balance
 
05:52:39.190 --> 05:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
those harms i don't think it's a close
 
05:52:39.200 --> 05:52:40.390 align:start position:0%
those harms i don't think it's a close
call

05:52:40.390 --> 05:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
call
 
05:52:42.070 --> 05:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
now let me say one other thing that the
 
05:52:44.948 --> 05:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
bill does that that should be of some
 
05:52:48.788 --> 05:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
help if the repair is necessary because
 
05:52:50.788 --> 05:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
it to remedy a condition that's a
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
violation of the housing code
 
05:52:55.190 --> 05:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
the owner can go ahead as if this law
 
05:52:58.070 --> 05:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
didn't exist as long as the land if if
 
05:52:59.830 --> 05:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
the landlord first has to ask for an
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
extension if they can't get it that's it
 
05:53:05.430 --> 05:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
if there's a lead issue the this doesn't
 
05:53:08.070 --> 05:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
affect the lead law which has a separate
 
05:53:10.628 --> 05:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
provision about evicting people from
 
05:53:10.638 --> 05:53:12.310 align:start position:0%
provision about evicting people from
lead

05:53:12.310 --> 05:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
lead
 
05:53:14.230 --> 05:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
apartments with lead hazard it doesn't
 
05:53:16.310 --> 05:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
affect them at all
 
05:53:16.320 --> 05:53:19.350 align:start position:0%
affect them at all
um

05:53:19.350 --> 05:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%

little too long but um i just urge you

questions

05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:54:13.110 --> 05:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
for attorney barry
 
05:54:14.708 --> 05:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:54:19.270 --> 05:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um are folks that are
 
05:54:23.910 --> 05:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
evicted um under this particular reason
 
05:54:26.548 --> 05:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
do they still preserve the same due
 
05:54:29.830 --> 05:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
process rights if they're evicted um for
 
05:54:32.070 --> 05:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
other uh reasons like non-payment of
 
05:54:33.750 --> 05:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
rent or things like that so is it they
 
05:54:35.910 --> 05:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
sell the same due process the procedure
 
05:54:38.708 --> 05:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same um but if i could
 
05:54:40.708 --> 05:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
add it's which isn't exactly the answer
 
05:54:42.548 --> 05:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
to you yeah your question
 
05:54:44.788 --> 05:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
the one of the problems right now even
 
05:54:47.190 --> 05:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
though there's a court process as the
 
05:54:49.030 --> 05:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
chairman knows very well
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
but one of the problems is
 
05:54:55.430 --> 05:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
the when a client
 
05:54:57.190 --> 05:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
gets served with the landlord tenant
 
05:54:59.110 --> 05:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
rift to start the eviction process in
 
05:55:01.190 --> 05:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
court that gets
 
05:55:03.270 --> 05:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
um that gets
 
05:55:05.430 --> 05:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
scooped up in the landlord reporting
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
system but the reporting system doesn't
 
05:55:10.868 --> 05:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
report why the eviction happened all the
 
05:55:13.190 --> 05:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
prospective landlord sees is that that
 
05:55:15.510 --> 05:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
person they that the land they prior
 
05:55:17.670 --> 05:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
landlord filed an eviction action
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
against them and that is makes what is
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
difficult a market that is difficult
 
05:55:24.628 --> 05:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
that's one more
 
05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
major barrier to getting re-housed
 
05:55:29.430 --> 05:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't know did i answer your
 
05:55:29.440 --> 05:55:31.910 align:start position:0%
but i don't know did i answer your
question

05:55:31.910 --> 05:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:55:35.510 --> 05:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
other questions representative horrigan
 
05:55:40.310 --> 05:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i
 
05:55:41.910 --> 05:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
saw all these three letters you're
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
handing out because they had i saw them
 
05:55:45.670 --> 05:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
in my email and managed to
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
print them out so
 
05:55:48.708 --> 05:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
two of them uh
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
officially they're stewards management
 
05:55:52.708 --> 05:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
and lakes region those are both
 
05:55:54.788 --> 05:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
those are both landlords who specialize
 
05:55:57.590 --> 05:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
in subsidized housing so they're not uh
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
they're not part of the mainstream for
 
05:56:01.670 --> 05:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
profit landlord commit community no
 
05:56:03.990 --> 05:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
steward is is wholly for-profit although
 
05:56:06.548 --> 05:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
he a lot of their profit a lot of their
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
properties do have units in them that
 
05:56:10.708 --> 05:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
are subsidized but they are a for-profit
 
05:56:13.110 --> 05:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
entity lake region community is a
 
05:56:16.390 --> 05:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
non-profit okay follow up you may thank
 
05:56:16.400 --> 05:56:17.030 align:start position:0%
non-profit okay follow up you may thank
you

05:56:17.030 --> 05:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:56:19.830 --> 05:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for clearing clearing
 
05:56:21.830 --> 05:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
that up it did seem in congress for
 
05:56:24.070 --> 05:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
a for-profit landlord to be talking
 
05:56:25.030 --> 05:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
about something that benefits the
 
05:56:26.708 --> 05:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
tenants but i see why
 
05:56:26.718 --> 05:56:28.150 align:start position:0%
tenants but i see why
why

05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
why it's a good good idea for him to do
 
05:56:31.590 --> 05:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
that but there's a story in laconia
 
05:56:33.590 --> 05:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
about a property where everyone was
 
05:56:35.190 --> 05:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
kicked out within 30 days and then they
 
05:56:37.030 --> 05:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
didn't start demolishing it for
 
05:56:38.070 --> 05:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
six months do you know anything about
 
05:56:40.150 --> 05:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
that story and that i don't know that
 
05:56:42.470 --> 05:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
story but i'm really glad you asked
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
because one of the other problems that i
 
05:56:47.110 --> 05:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
did not allude to
 
05:56:49.270 --> 05:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
is that although most of the time this
 
05:56:51.990 --> 05:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
is perfectly legitimate but a landlord
 
05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
who wants to evict somebody
 
05:56:56.470 --> 05:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
for some other reason but doesn't want
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
to take that to court the easiest thing
 
05:57:00.390 --> 05:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the world for them to do is say i'm
 
05:57:02.070 --> 05:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
selling the property i'm going to rehab
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
the property and i can tell you it's a
 
05:57:06.150 --> 05:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
lawyer who's tried to defend i have to
 
05:57:08.150 --> 05:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
tell those clients well what how am i
 
05:57:09.830 --> 05:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to prove that you can't that
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
you're not going to sell it or you're
 
05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
not going to rehab the property it's an
 
05:57:15.910 --> 05:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
invitation for abuse now again i'm not
 
05:57:17.990 --> 05:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
saying that's real common but i do know
 
05:57:19.910 --> 05:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's out there
 
05:57:22.070 --> 05:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
and at least by at least by extending
 
05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
the notice period for 30 days you can
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:29.510 --> 05:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
05:57:31.990 --> 05:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
mr berry i
 
05:57:33.990 --> 05:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
i was under the impression that if
 
05:57:37.350 --> 05:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
someone had a lease
 
05:57:39.830 --> 05:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
even if the property
 
05:57:41.830 --> 05:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
was sold
 
05:57:45.110 --> 05:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
the lease continued to be in effect am i
 
05:57:46.948 --> 05:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
no you're right about that but it's just
 
05:57:49.030 --> 05:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
that there's an awful lot of tenants who
 
05:57:50.708 --> 05:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
neither never had a lease in the first
 
05:57:52.948 --> 05:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
place or their lease is expired and
 
05:57:54.628 --> 05:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
they're going month-to-month i'd say
 
05:57:56.628 --> 05:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
among my client
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
clientele that's probably the most
 
05:58:03.510 --> 05:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:05.030 --> 05:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
other questions yes
 
05:58:06.470 --> 05:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
zen kenny
 
05:58:08.868 --> 05:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question and
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
um my concern might be off base so lines
 
05:58:14.788 --> 05:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
12 through 23 lays out exceptions and a
 
05:58:16.948 --> 05:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
and b makes sense to me um i do have a
 
05:58:18.868 --> 05:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
question about lines 20
 
05:58:22.150 --> 05:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh through 23 the words health safety
 
05:58:24.470 --> 05:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
deterioration are used but not
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily defined so i'm just
 
05:58:28.628 --> 05:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
wondering if without definitions could
 
05:58:31.030 --> 05:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
and not that a landlord would but
 
05:58:34.868 --> 05:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
could those terms be used to justify
 
05:58:37.510 --> 05:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh an eviction when renovation is is
 
05:58:37.520 --> 05:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
uh an eviction when renovation is is
needed

05:58:39.190 --> 05:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
needed
 
05:58:41.510 --> 05:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm really sorry uh representative kenny
 
05:58:43.590 --> 05:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
i must have a different copy can you
 
05:58:46.790 --> 05:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
what lines are you referring to
 
05:58:46.800 --> 05:58:52.830 align:start position:0%
what lines are you referring to
[Music]

05:58:52.830 --> 05:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:55.190 --> 05:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
05:58:55.200 --> 05:58:57.270 align:start position:0%
um thank you
gotcha

05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
um so i guess your if i understand your
 
05:59:02.948 --> 05:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
question is is um
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
is there still the possibility that
 
05:59:06.830 --> 05:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
landlords can
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh be telling lesson the whole story
 
05:59:12.868 --> 05:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
about that absolutely um and
 
05:59:15.190 --> 05:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
the only way i could prevent that is to
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
do something more draconian and i'm
 
05:59:19.590 --> 05:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
trying you know i'm trying not to uh
 
05:59:20.868 --> 05:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
have the uh
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
the perfect be the enemy of the good
 
05:59:23.040 --> 05:59:24.548 align:start position:0%
the perfect be the enemy of the good
here

05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:59:26.070 --> 05:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:28.948 --> 05:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:33.030 --> 05:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
i guess we the only question i have is
 
05:59:34.470 --> 05:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
at least they were
 
05:59:36.310 --> 05:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
a few years ago a couple years ago when
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
i got done
 
05:59:40.150 --> 05:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh judges had the discretion in the
 
05:59:44.948 --> 05:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
for people to
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
leave the premises
 
05:59:50.948 --> 05:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
after that they determined that an
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
eviction was appropriate
 
05:59:55.030 --> 05:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere from seven to ninety days it
 
05:59:55.040 --> 05:59:56.150 align:start position:0%
anywhere from seven to ninety days it
said

05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:59:58.470 --> 05:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
seven to ninety days so
 
06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it was always my practice to
 
06:00:04.230 --> 06:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
hear from the tenants as to what time
 
06:00:06.310 --> 06:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
they might need to get out of the
 
06:00:07.830 --> 06:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
premises so
 
06:00:09.190 --> 06:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:00:11.190 --> 06:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
presuming that still in effect and if it
 
06:00:13.430 --> 06:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
is still in effect
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
is that not adequate or not
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
practiced well
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
it's all over the map
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i mean sometimes i would say
 
06:00:26.788 --> 06:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
though in when i'm sitting in court
 
06:00:28.868 --> 06:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:00:30.548 --> 06:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
just seeing these cases you know while
 
06:00:32.788 --> 06:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting for my own i think
 
06:00:35.110 --> 06:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
especially in cases when you're talking
 
06:00:37.430 --> 06:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
about sales and rehab
 
06:00:40.628 --> 06:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
my gut tells me that the most common um
 
06:00:43.750 --> 06:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
discretionary stay is about 30 days
 
06:00:46.390 --> 06:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
and is that is that enough often and
 
06:00:48.708 --> 06:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's not and that's that's the it's not
 
06:00:50.788 --> 06:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
because the market is so hostile out
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
there to people who don't you know again
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars is a median rent
 
06:00:56.868 --> 06:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
for a two bedroom apartment
 
06:00:57.910 --> 06:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
i have clients who've looked for six
 
06:00:59.520 --> 06:01:00.628 align:start position:0%
i have clients who've looked for six
months

06:01:00.628 --> 06:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
months
 
06:01:02.310 --> 06:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
um and this isn't going to solve the
 
06:01:04.470 --> 06:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
problem but it just makes it a little
 
06:01:06.628 --> 06:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
bit easier um
 
06:01:08.310 --> 06:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
but you're right sometimes if you
 
06:01:09.990 --> 06:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
especially if you have a very elderly
 
06:01:12.150 --> 06:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
infirm client right who
 
06:01:13.590 --> 06:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know the court's going to feel
 
06:01:15.510 --> 06:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
sorry for sure sometimes he will get a
 
06:01:18.070 --> 06:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
longer stay than that but as i said i
 
06:01:19.750 --> 06:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
think the most common stay is right
 
06:01:23.750 --> 06:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.150 --> 06:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:01:28.150 --> 06:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking over these um this
 
06:01:34.150 --> 06:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
testimony from three different property
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
managers one of them is a former mayor
 
06:01:37.830 --> 06:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
of claremont and a member of the hou of
 
06:01:39.190 --> 06:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
the claremont housing authority the
 
06:01:41.430 --> 06:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
other two are our property owners slash
 
06:01:44.070 --> 06:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
managers and they support the bill so um
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
06:01:48.548 --> 06:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
are by law do they have to kick people
 
06:01:52.868 --> 06:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
out after 30 days or can they offer them
 
06:01:54.788 --> 06:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
a lot to offer them no they cannot they
 
06:01:56.470 --> 06:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
can offer as much time as they want
 
06:01:57.750 --> 06:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's a i mean
 
06:02:00.708 --> 06:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
the uh the law's requirements are the
 
06:02:03.030 --> 06:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
minimum right and they're the minimum
 
06:02:05.830 --> 06:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
and the most common but any landlord who
 
06:02:06.948 --> 06:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
has uh
 
06:02:08.948 --> 06:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
you know feeling humanitarian extremely
 
06:02:11.110 --> 06:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
crowded that's when rental prices went
 
06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
up here because you had
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
millennials staying in the rental market
 
06:02:17.510 --> 06:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
longer retirees going into the rental
 
06:02:19.830 --> 06:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
market and you had 20 000 new hampshire
 
06:02:22.150 --> 06:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
families face foreclosure and we didn't
 
06:02:23.430 --> 06:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
build anything
 
06:02:25.750 --> 06:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
so um no i don't i don't think this a
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
sunset provision would be appropriate in
 
06:02:29.830 --> 06:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
this case thank you for the question
 
06:02:33.830 --> 06:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:35.270 --> 06:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you for your testimony
 
06:02:35.280 --> 06:02:37.990 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you for your testimony
today

06:02:37.990 --> 06:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:44.470 --> 06:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
once again for the opportunity to speak
 
06:02:50.310 --> 06:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
um you know me pretty well i am an
 
06:02:53.110 --> 06:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
advocate for landlords we have
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
a following of
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
2500 or more landlords across the state
 
06:03:01.030 --> 06:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to pass out testimonies
 
06:03:03.350 --> 06:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
you can provision this this is called
 
06:03:03.360 --> 06:03:04.548 align:start position:0%
you can provision this this is called
for

06:03:04.548 --> 06:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:03:06.788 --> 06:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
in this which are actually
 
06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the range of lines 18 through
 
06:03:09.520 --> 06:03:11.110 align:start position:0%
in the range of lines 18 through
23.

06:03:11.110 --> 06:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
23.
 
06:03:12.788 --> 06:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
they're they're uh
 
06:03:14.310 --> 06:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
someone already flagged out that they're
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
not very well defined
 
06:03:17.830 --> 06:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
you could find yourself in court trying
 
06:03:20.548 --> 06:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
to defend something that's
 
06:03:22.868 --> 06:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
hard to define and so
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
then you may find out that that case has
 
06:03:25.440 --> 06:03:26.948 align:start position:0%
then you may find out that that case has
been

06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:03:26.958 --> 06:03:29.030 align:start position:0%
been
um

06:03:29.030 --> 06:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:31.110 --> 06:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't doesn't work the judge goes
 
06:03:32.628 --> 06:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
against the property owner and so now
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
the property owner starts another
 
06:03:34.718 --> 06:03:35.990 align:start position:0%
the property owner starts another
eviction

06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
06:03:37.590 --> 06:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
they started with 30 days then they
 
06:03:39.510 --> 06:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
might restart with 60 and now it's
 
06:03:41.910 --> 06:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
taking longer and longer and longer
 
06:03:45.910 --> 06:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
also i'll remind and all of those delays
 
06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
transfer into lost revenue which
 
06:03:52.628 --> 06:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
also i just want to remind in case
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
people are forgetting that
 
06:03:59.030 --> 06:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is only the first step in eviction
 
06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
an eviction takes
 
06:04:03.430 --> 06:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
with a seven day eviction takes about
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
six to eight weeks
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
so if we're adding
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
21 to
 
06:04:11.750 --> 06:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
51 days
 
06:04:14.230 --> 06:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
six to eight weeks is becoming 51 days
 
06:04:14.240 --> 06:04:15.590 align:start position:0%
six to eight weeks is becoming 51 days
longer

06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
longer
 
06:04:15.600 --> 06:04:17.350 align:start position:0%
longer
so

06:04:17.350 --> 06:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:19.510 --> 06:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's also the discretionary stays
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
that can be granted and what we're
 
06:04:23.910 --> 06:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
seeing in the courts now we're talking
 
06:04:25.350 --> 06:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
about the difference in this market
 
06:04:26.788 --> 06:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
versus previous markets what we're
 
06:04:28.708 --> 06:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
seeing in the course now
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
is that pretty well all courts across
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
the state are doing everything they can
 
06:04:37.270 --> 06:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
to extend the eviction workout
 
06:04:39.350 --> 06:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
agreements between landlords and tenants
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
use rental assistance earnings
 
06:04:45.190 --> 06:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
monies if it's the issues with money
 
06:04:45.200 --> 06:04:46.548 align:start position:0%
monies if it's the issues with money
so

06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:49.750 --> 06:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
we don't see that there's
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of harm that would come
 
06:04:51.360 --> 06:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of harm that would come
from

06:04:52.310 --> 06:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
forcing 60 days
 
06:04:56.788 --> 06:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
and there's certainly a lot of confusion
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
in the language it would depress sales
 
06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
any time that you extend notices it's
 
06:05:05.270 --> 06:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to cause pressure on driving up
 
06:05:08.310 --> 06:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
the rents it would delay repairs
 
06:05:10.708 --> 06:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't cure the issue
 
06:05:13.270 --> 06:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
the issue is a shortage in supply but
 
06:05:16.070 --> 06:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
this was totally right when she said
 
06:05:17.990 --> 06:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we haven't been building enough
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
06:05:20.628 --> 06:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's our issue
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
we need to focus our energy on building
 
06:05:25.030 --> 06:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
more rental housing
 
06:05:28.230 --> 06:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
and i think specifically workforce
 
06:05:30.470 --> 06:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
and lower income housing
 
06:05:32.070 --> 06:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the way things are in our market
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:05:35.190 --> 06:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
with the restrictions that keep coming
 
06:05:37.190 --> 06:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
out in the eviction moratoriums that we
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
just got through
 
06:05:40.708 --> 06:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
06:05:43.030 --> 06:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
beyond the shadow of a doubt
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
there are many
 
06:05:46.628 --> 06:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
mom and pop landlords
 
06:05:47.590 --> 06:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
that are
 
06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
leaving the business
 
06:05:51.750 --> 06:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
selling their properties and who's
 
06:05:53.190 --> 06:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
buying them
 
06:05:55.430 --> 06:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
corporate investors
 
06:05:56.708 --> 06:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
that come in
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
and do renovations and raise the rents
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
and every time that happens we lose
 
06:06:05.110 --> 06:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
another piece of affordable housing
 
06:06:07.590 --> 06:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
so anytime there's more restrictions and
 
06:06:10.150 --> 06:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
barriers put on property owners and
 
06:06:10.160 --> 06:06:12.310 align:start position:0%
barriers put on property owners and
landlords

06:06:12.310 --> 06:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
06:06:13.990 --> 06:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
then you're going to see it translate
 
06:06:14.000 --> 06:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
then you're going to see it translate
into

06:06:15.110 --> 06:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
into
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
less affordable housing and higher rents
 
06:06:20.948 --> 06:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
i would certainly do delay
 
06:06:24.390 --> 06:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
repairs for hazardous conditions
 
06:06:31.990 --> 06:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:35.350 --> 06:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
i wanted to tell you about my past week
 
06:06:36.708 --> 06:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
just to give you a sense of the real
 
06:06:38.548 --> 06:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
estate market because people are talking
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
about how hot and fast and hard it is to
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
get an apartment
 
06:06:44.868 --> 06:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
in our office we finally put another ad
 
06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the craigslist
 
06:06:50.628 --> 06:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
where a lot of landlords put their ads
 
06:06:52.470 --> 06:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
and it's been a while because not as
 
06:06:54.548 --> 06:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
many people are moving
 
06:06:56.948 --> 06:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
because it's hard harder to find a place
 
06:06:56.958 --> 06:06:58.070 align:start position:0%
because it's hard harder to find a place
granted

06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
granted
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
i absolutely understand that
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
we put in the ad
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
within two days i got maybe six to eight
 
06:07:08.708 --> 06:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
calls responses to that ad
 
06:07:11.110 --> 06:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
i had three showings and i had one
 
06:07:11.120 --> 06:07:14.708 align:start position:0%
i had three showings and i had one
application

06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:20.150 --> 06:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:23.590 --> 06:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
that just happened this past week
 
06:07:26.470 --> 06:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
now i won't say that it's not hard to
 
06:07:28.470 --> 06:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
find an apartment yes
 
06:07:31.190 --> 06:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage in supply
 
06:07:32.948 --> 06:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
there's no question there's a shortage
 
06:07:34.390 --> 06:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
in supply
 
06:07:36.390 --> 06:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
and so it is harder for people to find
 
06:07:36.400 --> 06:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
and so it is harder for people to find
something

06:07:37.510 --> 06:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:07:40.390 --> 06:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
but you have to also realize that
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
creating a longer notice
 
06:07:44.470 --> 06:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
from a landlord
 
06:07:47.670 --> 06:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
is going to worsen the situation for
 
06:07:49.990 --> 06:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing because
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
a tenant is required to give 30 days
 
06:07:52.638 --> 06:07:54.310 align:start position:0%
a tenant is required to give 30 days
notice

06:07:54.310 --> 06:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
notice
 
06:07:56.868 --> 06:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
so if a landlord gives
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
has to give 60
 
06:08:02.150 --> 06:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
but the tenant only has to give 30
 
06:08:03.990 --> 06:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
then the tenant that's been given 60
 
06:08:06.868 --> 06:08:06.878 align:start position:0%
days notice is now out looking
 
06:08:08.230 --> 06:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
and probably they're out looking right
 
06:08:10.470 --> 06:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
away because yes it is harder to find
 
06:08:10.480 --> 06:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
away because yes it is harder to find
something

06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
but are they finding anything that's
 
06:08:16.868 --> 06:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
available 60 days out or 45 days out
 
06:08:18.788 --> 06:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
probably not
 
06:08:20.548 --> 06:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
because the tenant is only required to
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
give 30 days notice
 
06:08:24.310 --> 06:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
so now what you're doing
 
06:08:25.990 --> 06:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
is you're creating
 
06:08:28.548 --> 06:08:28.558 align:start position:0%
another demand
 
06:08:30.548 --> 06:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
on the supply
 
06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
and when you have more demand on the
 
06:08:32.400 --> 06:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
and when you have more demand on the
supply

06:08:34.070 --> 06:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
supply
 
06:08:36.230 --> 06:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
for housing and there's not there a
 
06:08:37.990 --> 06:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
landlord doesn't have it because the
 
06:08:40.548 --> 06:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
senate hasn't given them a 30-day notice
 
06:08:42.230 --> 06:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
then you're going to see more pressure
 
06:08:44.948 --> 06:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
on increasing the rents it will worsen
 
06:08:47.430 --> 06:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
06:08:49.590 --> 06:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is make the situation
 
06:08:52.708 --> 06:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
better by having more housing and i urge
 
06:08:54.390 --> 06:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
you to support all the different bills
 
06:08:56.548 --> 06:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
that come to you that would create more
 
06:08:56.558 --> 06:08:57.510 align:start position:0%
that come to you that would create more
housing

06:08:57.510 --> 06:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
housing
 
06:09:01.190 --> 06:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
and and we're supporting those as well
 
06:09:03.190 --> 06:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more in my notes and i
 
06:09:04.788 --> 06:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
could you know i could probably talk for
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
three hours
 
06:09:06.000 --> 06:09:06.948 align:start position:0%
three hours
so

06:09:06.948 --> 06:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
i'll stop and i haven't covered
 
06:09:10.070 --> 06:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
everything and i would be really
 
06:09:12.548 --> 06:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
delighted to take any questions please
 
06:09:14.230 --> 06:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr norman are there any
 
06:09:14.240 --> 06:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr norman are there any
questions

06:09:15.590 --> 06:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:09:17.990 --> 06:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
nick for taking my question
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
i just read this one area here that
 
06:09:24.948 --> 06:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
you're saying the bill would delay
 
06:09:27.110 --> 06:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
removing troublesome tenants that is
 
06:09:28.868 --> 06:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
disturbing and threatening could you
 
06:09:31.190 --> 06:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
explain to me how this bill is going to
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
delay removing someone that is being
 
06:09:36.548 --> 06:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
disruptive absolutely
 
06:09:39.910 --> 06:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
so the state has set up
 
06:09:39.920 --> 06:09:40.948 align:start position:0%
so the state has set up
several

06:09:40.948 --> 06:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
several
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
situations that make it hard for
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
and when you have
 
06:09:49.750 --> 06:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
a tenant that's causing nuisance to the
 
06:09:49.760 --> 06:09:50.548 align:start position:0%
a tenant that's causing nuisance to the
other

06:09:50.548 --> 06:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:09:50.558 --> 06:09:52.548 align:start position:0%
other
residents

06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
residents
 
06:09:57.190 --> 06:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
you can evict them on a 30-day notice
 
06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
but maybe not
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
because you have to get to court and you
 
06:10:02.708 --> 06:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
have to prove
 
06:10:05.270 --> 06:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
the nuisance you have to prove the drug
 
06:10:07.110 --> 06:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
abuse you have to prove the drug
 
06:10:07.120 --> 06:10:08.548 align:start position:0%
abuse you have to prove the drug
trafficking

06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
our previous judge can
 
06:10:11.920 --> 06:10:13.670 align:start position:0%
our previous judge can
can

06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:10:15.350 --> 06:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
confirm that
 
06:10:17.030 --> 06:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's very hard
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
to to win an eviction case for for that
 
06:10:22.470 --> 06:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing
 
06:10:24.948 --> 06:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
or even domestic violence you have
 
06:10:27.270 --> 06:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
someone that's a perpetrator
 
06:10:29.190 --> 06:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
that you want to remove because they're
 
06:10:31.350 --> 06:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
actually causing harm to others you have
 
06:10:33.590 --> 06:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
to prove all that stuff
 
06:10:33.600 --> 06:10:34.788 align:start position:0%
to prove all that stuff
and

06:10:34.788 --> 06:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
almost a hundred percent if you ask your
 
06:10:37.840 --> 06:10:39.110 align:start position:0%
almost a hundred percent if you ask your
tenants

06:10:39.110 --> 06:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
to testify in court
 
06:10:44.230 --> 06:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
so that you can prove and win a case
 
06:10:45.590 --> 06:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
they won't
 
06:10:48.310 --> 06:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're too much afraid of retribution
 
06:10:50.150 --> 06:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
but what you can do
 
06:10:51.670 --> 06:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
and so one of the only things that the
 
06:10:53.670 --> 06:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
state allows is you can say okay for
 
06:10:55.270 --> 06:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
business reasons i'm going to renovate
 
06:10:57.750 --> 06:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
that apartment
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine you can renovate the
 
06:11:01.510 --> 06:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
apartment i'll renovate the apartment
 
06:11:03.670 --> 06:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'll raise the rents
 
06:11:05.430 --> 06:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
because i renovated
 
06:11:07.830 --> 06:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's the only real choice that's
 
06:11:10.230 --> 06:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
workable that's given to the landlord
 
06:11:12.788 --> 06:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
and once again that worsens the
 
06:11:15.430 --> 06:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
situation because now to get that tenant
 
06:11:17.270 --> 06:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
out i need to renovate and of course i
 
06:11:19.270 --> 06:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
renovate and now i raise the rents and
 
06:11:20.788 --> 06:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
then i've solved the problem the other
 
06:11:22.708 --> 06:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
people can live in peace and quiet
 
06:11:22.718 --> 06:11:24.150 align:start position:0%
people can live in peace and quiet
enjoyment

06:11:24.150 --> 06:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
enjoyment
 
06:11:24.160 --> 06:11:25.190 align:start position:0%
enjoyment
but

06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:11:27.270 --> 06:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
you've got one more apartment this off
 
06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
the affordable list
 
06:11:34.948 --> 06:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:37.750 --> 06:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative macbeth
 
06:11:39.590 --> 06:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you mr norman for
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:11:42.628 --> 06:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
so is it your understanding that this
 
06:11:46.628 --> 06:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
bill does impact nuisance evictions
 
06:11:48.310 --> 06:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
nuisance um
 
06:11:51.670 --> 06:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
well it would impact
 
06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
so yes and no
 
06:11:55.350 --> 06:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
so no
 
06:11:59.990 --> 06:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:00.000 --> 06:12:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:12:01.590 --> 06:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:12:04.390 --> 06:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
so i have another follow-up you may

um
 
06:12:15.270 --> 06:12:15.280 align:start position:0%

but because i may want to help you with
 
06:12:19.110 --> 06:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
public relations would you be interested

is sophia hyatt and i'm an attorney at
 
06:13:05.350 --> 06:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal assistance uh but
 
06:13:06.948 --> 06:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
unlike elliot i've been there for about
 
06:13:09.110 --> 06:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
10 months not 40 years so
 
06:13:10.868 --> 06:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately though in those 10
 
06:13:12.868 --> 06:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
months i've had more than seven
 
06:13:15.750 --> 06:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
renovation eviction cases um i'm going
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
to talk about some of them but i also
 
06:13:18.868 --> 06:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
want to respond to some of the comments
 
06:13:20.830 --> 06:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
that have been made
 
06:13:24.310 --> 06:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
um with all respects to mr norman what
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
he just said about using this to evict
 
06:13:29.430 --> 06:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
people for other issues is exactly what
 
06:13:31.830 --> 06:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and changing it from
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 days will make it harder for
 
06:13:35.910 --> 06:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
people to do just that and that's not
 
06:13:37.990 --> 06:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a renovation good cause
 
06:13:40.708 --> 06:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
eviction you know there are ways to
 
06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
evict in the law for that and the court
 
06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
process should be followed and not you
 
06:13:48.548 --> 06:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
know manipulated and uh we shouldn't
 
06:13:50.310 --> 06:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
decide on how to
 
06:13:51.990 --> 06:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
adapt bills for something like this so
 
06:13:54.150 --> 06:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
that a landlord can manipulate our court
 
06:13:55.750 --> 06:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
system i would hope that everyone in the
 
06:13:57.350 --> 06:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
room agrees with that
 
06:13:59.350 --> 06:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
um and also talking about corporate
 
06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
landlords coming in and buying up
 
06:14:03.270 --> 06:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
properties that's already happening so
 
06:14:04.948 --> 06:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
make no mistake that that's happening
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
already we're not you know if we don't
 
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
do this that's not going to prevent that
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
from happening that's already happening
 
06:14:11.350 --> 06:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
here um
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
and also there was a discussion earlier
 
06:14:13.680 --> 06:14:14.788 align:start position:0%
and also there was a discussion earlier
about

06:14:14.788 --> 06:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
some of the sections in in some of the
 
06:14:19.510 --> 06:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
lines and the exceptions and the 30-day
 
06:14:21.270 --> 06:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
notice exception i just want to point
 
06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
out that that language that's um being
 
06:14:25.590 --> 06:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
referenced as causing confusion is
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
already in section
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh rsa 541 little a so
 
06:14:33.190 --> 06:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
the alleged confusion is is from
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
language that's already in our statute
 
06:14:36.788 --> 06:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clarify that
 
06:14:39.590 --> 06:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so i want to talk a little bit about
 
06:14:43.510 --> 06:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
my work at nhla uh i in 2021 our our
 
06:14:45.910 --> 06:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
organization had 32 intakes for
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
renovation evictions
 
06:14:49.350 --> 06:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh that was represented 30 different
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
tenants we had a couple people that
 
06:14:52.310 --> 06:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
brought cases back
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh we had to reject five of those cases
 
06:14:57.350 --> 06:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh like i said i've done and that was
 
06:14:59.910 --> 06:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
just for 2021 we also do work in the
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashua district courts
 
06:15:03.190 --> 06:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
and we regularly see evictions for
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
renovation in those in those situations
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
as well
 
06:15:08.948 --> 06:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
most people that don't get legal aid
 
06:15:10.548 --> 06:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
don't know that they don't have to move
 
06:15:12.788 --> 06:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
out when their eviction notice expires
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
every client i've talked to in this
 
06:15:15.350 --> 06:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
situation is like all right well i'm
 
06:15:17.350 --> 06:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
packing and i have to move out and we're
 
06:15:18.788 --> 06:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
like no you don't have to move out right
 
06:15:21.350 --> 06:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
away so the id you know a lot of tenants
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
who don't get legal assistance and
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
remember i just told you we had to
 
06:15:26.230 --> 06:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
reject five cases i'm sure that'll be
 
06:15:27.750 --> 06:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know we always are rejecting things
 
06:15:29.030 --> 06:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we just don't have the
 
06:15:29.040 --> 06:15:30.390 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we just don't have the
resources

06:15:30.390 --> 06:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
resources
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
that there are people who are just going
 
06:15:33.750 --> 06:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
to move out and they don't realize that
 
06:15:35.110 --> 06:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
they can fight it and they think that
 
06:15:36.628 --> 06:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
they just have to leave so that would
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
really help these people get either
 
06:15:40.150 --> 06:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
reach out for legal advice by having a
 
06:15:42.150 --> 06:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
little bit more time or just have more
 
06:15:42.160 --> 06:15:42.948 align:start position:0%
little bit more time or just have more
time

06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:15:45.830 --> 06:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
to find a place and it is true that 60
 
06:15:47.590 --> 06:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
days isn't a magic number people aren't
 
06:15:49.590 --> 06:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to find a place
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
but it lessens the amount of time that
 
06:15:53.430 --> 06:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
that person is homeless going to your
 
06:15:55.750 --> 06:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities for local welfare dollars
 
06:15:58.070 --> 06:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
and asking for them to pay for tran uh
 
06:15:59.830 --> 06:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
transitional housing so
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
when people are homeless they're going
 
06:16:02.868 --> 06:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
to your towns and asking for money so
 
06:16:03.670 --> 06:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that you should
 
06:16:05.830 --> 06:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
consider when thinking about minimizing
 
06:16:08.070 --> 06:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
the uh i'm sorry you're not minimizing
 
06:16:09.670 --> 06:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
extending the amount of time that
 
06:16:12.548 --> 06:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
tenants would have for a notice period
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh one of my clients was
 
06:16:16.788 --> 06:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
recently at the end of last year facing
 
06:16:18.390 --> 06:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
eviction for renovation he lived there
 
06:16:20.948 --> 06:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
for five years didn't want to move like
 
06:16:23.190 --> 06:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
the town he was in but understood that
 
06:16:25.270 --> 06:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
he had to move uh we negotiated a
 
06:16:27.030 --> 06:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
move-out agreement he moved out and
 
06:16:28.628 --> 06:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
three days later his landlord had
 
06:16:30.948 --> 06:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
painted the property and posted it on
 
06:16:33.030 --> 06:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
craigslist for 50 more
 
06:16:33.040 --> 06:16:34.150 align:start position:0%
craigslist for 50 more
so

06:16:34.150 --> 06:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:37.190 --> 06:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
this is regularly used by landlords to
 
06:16:39.190 --> 06:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
circumvent the legal eviction process
 
06:16:40.470 --> 06:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
and you should not be
 
06:16:42.230 --> 06:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
making your decision based on supporting
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
what you know to be manipulation of that
 
06:16:44.160 --> 06:16:45.510 align:start position:0%
what you know to be manipulation of that
process

06:16:45.510 --> 06:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:16:45.520 --> 06:16:46.628 align:start position:0%
process
um

06:16:46.628 --> 06:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:48.470 --> 06:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
another client of mine lived in her
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
apartment my client's a disabled woman
 
06:16:52.390 --> 06:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
and her daughter who's in college takes
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
care of her uh they lived in an
 
06:16:57.110 --> 06:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
apartment for 16 years her landlord sold
 
06:16:59.190 --> 06:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
the building and the new landlord i
 
06:17:00.150 --> 06:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
understand they talked about you know
 
06:17:02.230 --> 06:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
when a new owner wants comes in they
 
06:17:03.190 --> 06:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
06:17:05.030 --> 06:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
make changes that's not always true in
 
06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
this case that's not what happened and
 
06:17:08.788 --> 06:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
she was evicted we did negotiate a
 
06:17:11.430 --> 06:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
move-out agreement even though we
 
06:17:13.270 --> 06:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
negotiated a move-out agreement she
 
06:17:14.470 --> 06:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
still had to move in with another
 
06:17:16.470 --> 06:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
daughter of hers 50 minutes away which
 
06:17:18.150 --> 06:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
is 50 minutes away from her healthcare
 
06:17:20.310 --> 06:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
providers and appointments so we're not
 
06:17:21.830 --> 06:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
saying that 60 days is going to solve
 
06:17:23.350 --> 06:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
the problem but it is going to help
 
06:17:25.190 --> 06:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
people have more time to look for a
 
06:17:26.948 --> 06:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
place and again it's also going to
 
06:17:29.190 --> 06:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
lessen the burden on your municipalities
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you represent in terms of how much
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
money they have to pay out in local
 
06:17:34.470 --> 06:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
welfare cases
 
06:17:36.788 --> 06:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
um i also have a veteran right now that
 
06:17:38.628 --> 06:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
i work with who is currently homeless
 
06:17:41.110 --> 06:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
he's living in a temporary housing
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
he you know he's paying for
 
06:17:45.110 --> 06:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
a five-day stay at a time we're working
 
06:17:46.628 --> 06:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
with agencies to try and figure out a
 
06:17:48.230 --> 06:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
place for him to go and he was evicted
 
06:17:50.310 --> 06:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
for renovation so this is very real
 
06:17:52.070 --> 06:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
again i've been doing this for
 
06:17:53.830 --> 06:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
about 10 months i've had i think i said
 
06:17:57.030 --> 06:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
like more than seven cases already so
 
06:17:59.190 --> 06:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
just this is a very real thing it really
 
06:18:01.350 --> 06:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
affects people and any extra time is
 
06:18:02.868 --> 06:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
going to help people
 
06:18:06.150 --> 06:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:10.548 --> 06:18:10.558 align:start position:0%

from tenants we've been running tenant
 
06:19:04.708 --> 06:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
clinics for about um
 
06:19:06.230 --> 06:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
six months now
 
06:19:07.990 --> 06:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
in manchester and nashua
 
06:19:11.110 --> 06:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
and most of those around evictions
 
06:19:13.270 --> 06:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
over the weekend i was in a meeting with
 
06:19:15.990 --> 06:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh tenants in manchester as well who
 
06:19:18.628 --> 06:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
have received eviction notices to move
 
06:19:20.948 --> 06:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
because of renovation i spoke to a
 
06:19:23.830 --> 06:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
single mother with a 15 year old
 
06:19:23.840 --> 06:19:24.788 align:start position:0%
single mother with a 15 year old
who

06:19:24.788 --> 06:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:19:27.350 --> 06:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what to do um she received
 
06:19:29.430 --> 06:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
a letter uh her rent is fifteen hundred
 
06:19:29.440 --> 06:19:30.548 align:start position:0%
a letter uh her rent is fifteen hundred
dollars

06:19:30.548 --> 06:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:19:32.230 --> 06:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
currently she's getting assistance
 
06:19:33.910 --> 06:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
through the cup agencies to pay for part
 
06:19:35.910 --> 06:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
of that money her rent went up by six
 
06:19:37.190 --> 06:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
06:19:39.270 --> 06:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
and now she's being told that she has to
 
06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
move out of this place
 
06:19:41.990 --> 06:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
in 30 days
 
06:19:43.990 --> 06:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
she really she expressed that she
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what to do because she's
 
06:19:47.510 --> 06:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
looked around for alternative places and
 
06:19:49.750 --> 06:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
she can't find any place that would take
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
her for that amount of money at the
 
06:19:51.360 --> 06:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
her for that amount of money at the
moment

06:19:53.110 --> 06:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
moment
 
06:19:55.670 --> 06:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
another family in manchester that uh
 
06:19:57.190 --> 06:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
we've heard from
 
06:19:59.670 --> 06:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's a a mother with two kids in a
 
06:20:01.430 --> 06:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
two bedroom apartment they've been
 
06:20:03.750 --> 06:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
living this building for 12 years
 
06:20:05.670 --> 06:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
and recently
 
06:20:06.548 --> 06:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:20:08.070 --> 06:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
the kids grew up in that same building
 
06:20:08.868 --> 06:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
so they don't know any other
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that's their neighborhood
 
06:20:12.230 --> 06:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
they've been in and the schools they go
 
06:20:12.240 --> 06:20:12.948 align:start position:0%
they've been in and the schools they go
to

06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:20:14.628 --> 06:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh and so recently they've been
 
06:20:16.468 --> 06:20:16.478 align:start position:0%
receiving notification as well that they
 
06:20:18.150 --> 06:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
have to move because of the renovation
 
06:20:20.150 --> 06:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
project that's going to take place
 
06:20:22.310 --> 06:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
we know most of these buildings are
 
06:20:24.628 --> 06:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
actually dilapidated they are very old
 
06:20:26.548 --> 06:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
and poor conditions and the tenants in
 
06:20:29.190 --> 06:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
those buildings do agree that renovation
 
06:20:30.548 --> 06:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
needs to take place
 
06:20:33.270 --> 06:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
but what they are trying to do is
 
06:20:35.030 --> 06:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
trying to find a place anywhere in
 
06:20:37.590 --> 06:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
manchester in nashua in concord anywhere
 
06:20:39.910 --> 06:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the states is very very challenging
 
06:20:42.468 --> 06:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
for these families and they have kids
 
06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
they have
 
06:20:44.788 --> 06:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
they have their resources within the
 
06:20:46.868 --> 06:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
community so
 
06:20:48.468 --> 06:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to
 
06:20:50.548 --> 06:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
do is try and find those alternatives
 
06:20:52.070 --> 06:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
the alternatives are not there that they
 
06:20:55.030 --> 06:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
can afford so this bill would be really
 
06:20:57.350 --> 06:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
critical in helping them figure out what
 
06:21:00.070 --> 06:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
that next step is so i'm here to urge
 
06:21:02.230 --> 06:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider passing this
 
06:21:04.628 --> 06:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
bill and so i thank you for your time
 
06:21:06.230 --> 06:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you will do the right
 
06:21:07.590 --> 06:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
thing and support families in new
 
06:21:07.600 --> 06:21:09.030 align:start position:0%
thing and support families in new

06:21:40.548 --> 06:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously by biola which was
 
06:21:42.310 --> 06:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
a product of going door-to-door over the
 
06:21:43.990 --> 06:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
past two years to try and help tenants
 
06:21:45.670 --> 06:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
understand their rights as it related to
 
06:21:47.670 --> 06:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
copen now and to get through these mass
 
06:21:47.680 --> 06:21:49.110 align:start position:0%
copen now and to get through these mass
evictions

06:21:49.110 --> 06:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
evictions
 
06:21:50.708 --> 06:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
i am also on the manchester housing
 
06:21:52.230 --> 06:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
commission to try and help alleviate
 
06:21:54.150 --> 06:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
some of these issues
 
06:21:55.750 --> 06:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
and what i wanted to speak to about
 
06:21:55.760 --> 06:21:56.708 align:start position:0%
and what i wanted to speak to about
today

06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:21:58.150 --> 06:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of little things and i tried to
 
06:21:59.510 --> 06:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
gather notes
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
and respond to a few different things i
 
06:22:03.750 --> 06:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
heard this afternoon
 
06:22:05.350 --> 06:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
what i do want to start with is mr
 
06:22:07.350 --> 06:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
norman stated these renovation evictions
 
06:22:09.590 --> 06:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
are being utilized as a quick no fight
 
06:22:10.948 --> 06:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
eviction when they don't want to go
 
06:22:12.468 --> 06:22:12.478 align:start position:0%
about it as they should and take their
 
06:22:12.478 --> 06:22:14.468 align:start position:0%
about it as they should and take their
chances

06:22:14.468 --> 06:22:14.478 align:start position:0%
chances
 
06:22:16.948 --> 06:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
i stated this when we were here with hb
 
06:22:19.430 --> 06:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
217 when it was in the house i stated it
 
06:22:21.430 --> 06:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
seemed like a knee-jerk reaction to the
 
06:22:23.910 --> 06:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
moratorium that was going on before
 
06:22:26.548 --> 06:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
they couldn't they couldn't evict people
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
they were stymied and they found a way
 
06:22:30.948 --> 06:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
and they've just taken off if you look
 
06:22:32.868 --> 06:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
back over the last 14 years at least the
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
last 14 years i've advocated you've
 
06:22:37.110 --> 06:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
never seen anything like this so to
 
06:22:39.110 --> 06:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
speak to the sunset date no i don't
 
06:22:40.548 --> 06:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
think we need to revisit it in three
 
06:22:41.990 --> 06:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
years because i don't think we're going
 
06:22:43.910 --> 06:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
backwards we've only continued to grow
 
06:22:46.390 --> 06:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
and expand and we need to expand more
 
06:22:48.230 --> 06:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
i don't see house prices shrinking i
 
06:22:49.430 --> 06:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't see us
 
06:22:51.670 --> 06:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
shrinking in the number of people so if
 
06:22:53.430 --> 06:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
anything in three years we may need to
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
expand this
 
06:22:54.840 --> 06:22:56.708 align:start position:0%
expand this
protections

06:22:56.708 --> 06:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
protections
 
06:22:56.718 --> 06:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
protections
um

06:22:57.590 --> 06:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:59.750 --> 06:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
there is as i said nobody checking on
 
06:23:02.310 --> 06:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
these i had a family at 360 dubuque
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
street that called me up with a
 
06:23:05.830 --> 06:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
renovation eviction and trying to help
 
06:23:07.270 --> 06:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
them go through it the day they were
 
06:23:09.750 --> 06:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
moving out somebody moved in
 
06:23:11.350 --> 06:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
they know this because they went back to
 
06:23:12.628 --> 06:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
get the rest of their stuff and they
 
06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
were too scared to go in because the
 
06:23:16.628 --> 06:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
other people were already moving in
 
06:23:18.310 --> 06:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
there was no renovating
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
there was not even paint on the wall on
 
06:23:22.708 --> 06:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
this i see this a lot and there's no way
 
06:23:24.708 --> 06:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
unless somebody takes civil action later
 
06:23:26.468 --> 06:23:26.478 align:start position:0%
to go back and say hey that wasn't a
 
06:23:28.708 --> 06:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
renovation addiction i have some
 
06:23:30.788 --> 06:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
families that have done the renovation
 
06:23:30.798 --> 06:23:32.150 align:start position:0%
families that have done the renovation
themselves

06:23:32.150 --> 06:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
06:23:34.070 --> 06:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
rachel gagne she would not mind me
 
06:23:35.670 --> 06:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
saying this and she's asked me to speak
 
06:23:38.230 --> 06:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
about her whenever i get the chance she
 
06:23:40.150 --> 06:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
renovated with her husband their
 
06:23:42.070 --> 06:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
building five out of six units
 
06:23:44.070 --> 06:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
themselves turned around when the
 
06:23:45.670 --> 06:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
building was bought and they renovated
 
06:23:46.868 --> 06:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
evicted them
 
06:23:48.548 --> 06:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
the people that actually renovated the
 
06:23:48.558 --> 06:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
the people that actually renovated the
place

06:23:49.430 --> 06:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:23:51.430 --> 06:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
and as maintenance said to them they
 
06:23:53.430 --> 06:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
were going to paint the walls replace
 
06:23:55.990 --> 06:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
the stove add a heater and that's it
 
06:23:58.070 --> 06:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's not a renovation but yet it's
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
being used this way
 
06:24:00.240 --> 06:24:01.830 align:start position:0%
being used this way
so

06:24:01.830 --> 06:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:03.670 --> 06:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
when we look at the stats we have four
 
06:24:05.110 --> 06:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
to eight weeks for an initial
 
06:24:07.750 --> 06:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
application for the nherap program
 
06:24:09.750 --> 06:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's just a caseworker getting that
 
06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
application and trying to contact them
 
06:24:14.150 --> 06:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
and work through the motions to get them
 
06:24:15.750 --> 06:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the program
 
06:24:17.830 --> 06:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
that takes generally two week two days
 
06:24:21.270 --> 06:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
to a week to happen that part
 
06:24:23.030 --> 06:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
and it takes up to six weeks for those
 
06:24:24.868 --> 06:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
checks to go out landlords are not
 
06:24:26.708 --> 06:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
wanting to use this program that much
 
06:24:28.628 --> 06:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
when a new client is coming in because
 
06:24:30.070 --> 06:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
they know they have to wait for the
 
06:24:32.628 --> 06:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
first month's rent the security deposit
 
06:24:34.230 --> 06:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
all that stuff it makes it harder
 
06:24:36.070 --> 06:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
actually to move with the program when
 
06:24:38.708 --> 06:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
it's this busy because
 
06:24:40.868 --> 06:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
as we've seen with that program it was
 
06:24:42.628 --> 06:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
having trouble being able to upload
 
06:24:42.638 --> 06:24:43.910 align:start position:0%
having trouble being able to upload
everything

06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
everything
 
06:24:46.468 --> 06:24:46.478 align:start position:0%
so then we have
 
06:24:47.910 --> 06:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about continued
 
06:24:49.990 --> 06:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
assistance after the first initial round
 
06:24:51.910 --> 06:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
and you go back to get more you're eight
 
06:24:53.510 --> 06:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
weeks until you get a caseworker
 
06:24:56.070 --> 06:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
assigned to you again
 
06:24:57.830 --> 06:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
it is incredible weights out there so
 
06:24:59.190 --> 06:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
you don't even have time to work with
 
06:25:01.110 --> 06:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
those two months barely with that we
 
06:25:03.510 --> 06:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
have 180 people currently in hotels as
 
06:25:05.350 --> 06:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the previous state not today's date
 
06:25:07.430 --> 06:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
so it could slightly change
 
06:25:09.510 --> 06:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
waiting lists at shelters so before they
 
06:25:11.030 --> 06:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
can even get to the hotel they're going
 
06:25:12.468 --> 06:25:12.478 align:start position:0%
to the shelter but then they find out
 
06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
they have a waiting list at the shelter
 
06:25:15.430 --> 06:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
too where did they go
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
warming stations are shutting down if
 
06:25:18.948 --> 06:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
you notice in your paper you see a lot
 
06:25:21.030 --> 06:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
more homeless issues on the police calls
 
06:25:22.548 --> 06:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
why because the warming centers are
 
06:25:23.830 --> 06:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
shutting down and they're having less
 
06:25:25.830 --> 06:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
places to go
 
06:25:27.510 --> 06:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
and that's where our families will be
 
06:25:30.150 --> 06:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
when they get evicted
 
06:25:31.910 --> 06:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
um it takes a minimum of two months to
 
06:25:33.510 --> 06:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
find a place and we have to remember
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is not just an address this is a
 
06:25:37.190 --> 06:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
home this is where people have set up
 
06:25:37.200 --> 06:25:38.070 align:start position:0%
home this is where people have set up
their

06:25:38.070 --> 06:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:25:40.230 --> 06:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
custody agreements you've got to give 60
 
06:25:42.070 --> 06:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
days notice on a custody agreement when
 
06:25:44.468 --> 06:25:44.478 align:start position:0%
you want to move out of the city that
 
06:25:46.628 --> 06:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
part hasn't even been raised
 
06:25:46.638 --> 06:25:47.590 align:start position:0%
part hasn't even been raised
so

06:25:47.590 --> 06:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:49.430 --> 06:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
we could be changing people's lives here
 
06:25:52.230 --> 06:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
a custodial parent could become
 
06:25:53.910 --> 06:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
the parent that sees their kid every two
 
06:25:55.590 --> 06:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
weeks instead because of this because
 
06:25:57.350 --> 06:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
people are casting large nets when they
 
06:25:58.708 --> 06:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
have to move
 
06:26:00.310 --> 06:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
i would love to hear where mr norman's
 
06:26:02.230 --> 06:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
apartment is because generally i hear of
 
06:26:05.030 --> 06:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
500 to 1000 calls on each apartment that
 
06:26:07.190 --> 06:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
is listed i am guessing and i'd love to
 
06:26:09.350 --> 06:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
know the answer i'm guessing it's not in
 
06:26:11.430 --> 06:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
manchester natural concord or around a
 
06:26:12.788 --> 06:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
big city
 
06:26:14.468 --> 06:26:14.478 align:start position:0%
and it might be quite high for rent
 
06:26:15.750 --> 06:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
because the other problem we're having
 
06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
is finding any actual affordable rent
 
06:26:18.948 --> 06:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
because we waited a really long time to
 
06:26:21.110 --> 06:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
start building it
 
06:26:25.190 --> 06:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
and i am welcome to any questions
 
06:26:30.628 --> 06:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:32.948 --> 06:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
see none uh did you have one represent
 
06:26:32.958 --> 06:26:34.070 align:start position:0%
see none uh did you have one represent

yep
 
06:26:36.628 --> 06:26:36.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and just for clarification
 
06:26:39.030 --> 06:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so um the

granite state organization project
 
06:26:44.230 --> 06:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's not the same as new hampshire
 
06:26:46.628 --> 06:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
housing with a voucher because you're
 
06:26:48.070 --> 06:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
talking you were talking about money
 
06:26:49.910 --> 06:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's given to the landlord but they
 
06:26:51.350 --> 06:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the first and last month's
 
06:26:53.350 --> 06:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
friend so they're just given the money
 
06:26:56.468 --> 06:26:56.478 align:start position:0%
it's with the nherap program they have
 
06:26:58.868 --> 06:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
up to 18 months of rental assistance and
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
the one month security deposit is
 
06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
separate from that
 
06:27:04.468 --> 06:27:04.478 align:start position:0%
so when they find an apartment they put
 
06:27:05.990 --> 06:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
their landlord information into their
 
06:27:07.350 --> 06:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
case worker
 
06:27:09.910 --> 06:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
and they start the process um that can
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
take about a week usually to have those
 
06:27:13.510 --> 06:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
go back and forth and then you got about
 
06:27:14.948 --> 06:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
six weeks till they get their check you
 
06:27:17.350 --> 06:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
can ask to expedite it but that's like
 
06:27:19.670 --> 06:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
two to three weeks instead of
 
06:27:21.750 --> 06:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
i mean expedite sometimes you think it's
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
really quick but that's still two to
 
06:27:24.310 --> 06:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
three weeks
 
06:27:24.320 --> 06:27:26.150 align:start position:0%
three weeks
um

06:27:26.150 --> 06:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:28.390 --> 06:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
and once they get in
 
06:27:29.750 --> 06:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
what we're starting to do now is
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
immediately after they go through the
 
06:27:32.628 --> 06:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
program and they get their money settled
 
06:27:34.390 --> 06:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be paid out we
 
06:27:35.990 --> 06:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
have them immediately do their continued
 
06:27:38.230 --> 06:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
assistance application because it's so
 
06:27:41.510 --> 06:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
long until they get to the next one
 
06:27:44.070 --> 06:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm actually currently in negotiations
 
06:27:45.830 --> 06:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the large landlord in town i have
 
06:27:47.750 --> 06:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
six buildings organized together under
 
06:27:49.510 --> 06:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
one owner because they're all going
 
06:27:51.430 --> 06:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
through evictions right now that's six
 
06:27:54.708 --> 06:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
buildings in manchester
 
06:27:57.350 --> 06:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
multi-unit buildings so as i explained
 
06:27:59.670 --> 06:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
to them we got a clog in the pipe and we
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
need to kind of slow it down here
 
06:28:03.270 --> 06:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
we got to let it trickle through how
 
06:28:04.628 --> 06:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
06:28:06.310 --> 06:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
and let it open up a little bit so
 
06:28:07.590 --> 06:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're willing to sit down and try and
 
06:28:09.430 --> 06:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
negotiate because this is a lot of hours
 
06:28:11.350 --> 06:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
for them in court also and if we can get
 
06:28:13.190 --> 06:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
some moved around but this is the first
 
06:28:13.200 --> 06:28:14.628 align:start position:0%
some moved around but this is the first
landlord

06:28:14.628 --> 06:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
06:28:16.390 --> 06:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
to ever do this
 
06:28:21.030 --> 06:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:21.040 --> 06:28:22.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:28:22.390 --> 06:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:28:23.830 --> 06:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i just
 
06:28:27.030 --> 06:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
so what i just what is n-a-g-r-e i may

be the only person that doesn't know
 
06:28:30.230 --> 06:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
that acronym but i i just when we say
 
06:28:34.708 --> 06:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:36.468 --> 06:28:36.478 align:start position:0%
right the which one
 
06:28:40.190 --> 06:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
i think i think you said nagre from
 
06:28:42.548 --> 06:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
nherap the new hampshire emergency
 
06:28:45.670 --> 06:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
rental assistance application program
 
06:28:48.628 --> 06:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:48.638 --> 06:28:50.468 align:start position:0%
 
other

06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you ms margerson for
 
06:28:55.590 --> 06:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:57.590 --> 06:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
06:28:57.600 --> 06:28:58.948 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

06:28:58.948 --> 06:28:58.958 align:start position:0%
testify
 
06:29:05.750 --> 06:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:08.708 --> 06:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
i just i have a question mr attorney
 
06:29:10.390 --> 06:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
barry if you just had another minute i
 
06:29:11.990 --> 06:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
just have a question
 
06:29:19.030 --> 06:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:21.590 --> 06:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
it has to do with it this creates this
 
06:29:23.990 --> 06:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
new section h the landlord desires to
 
06:29:27.190 --> 06:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
perform repairs to the dwelling unit
 
06:29:28.948 --> 06:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
which can't be done safely while the
 
06:29:31.750 --> 06:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
tenant resides right perform substantial
 
06:29:35.830 --> 06:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
renovations or sell the property
 
06:29:35.840 --> 06:29:36.788 align:start position:0%
renovations or sell the property
and

06:29:36.788 --> 06:29:36.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:29:36.798 --> 06:29:38.468 align:start position:0%
and
presumably

06:29:38.468 --> 06:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
06:29:40.628 --> 06:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
the landlord what i've heard here for
 
06:29:43.110 --> 06:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
testimony today is that
 
06:29:46.948 --> 06:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
these conditions may be used as a ruse
 
06:29:48.948 --> 06:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
in certain circumstances that's what
 
06:29:51.190 --> 06:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
i've heard for testimony yeah absolutely
 
06:29:53.190 --> 06:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
i mean that's happening
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
without the bill there's no question as
 
06:29:58.468 --> 06:29:58.478 align:start position:0%
mr norman essentially admitted it but um
 
06:30:00.310 --> 06:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
right and he said because you have a
 
06:30:02.310 --> 06:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
tenant you want to get rid of right but
 
06:30:03.990 --> 06:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
you don't you're concerned you can't
 
06:30:06.070 --> 06:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
prove it so you say okay i'll renovate
 
06:30:08.468 --> 06:30:08.478 align:start position:0%
the property well and i think that's
 
06:30:09.670 --> 06:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
what my
 
06:30:12.788 --> 06:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
my question relates to and that is
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
the level of proof
 
06:30:17.990 --> 06:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
that would be required at a court
 
06:30:27.350 --> 06:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:29.430 --> 06:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know the simple answer for you is
 
06:30:31.030 --> 06:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
that you know the level of proof is a
 
06:30:34.230 --> 06:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence but um
 
06:30:36.390 --> 06:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
i think normally in the experience that
 
06:30:38.468 --> 06:30:38.478 align:start position:0%
i have right now i mean i think what
 
06:30:40.310 --> 06:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
would probably happen is either the
 
06:30:42.390 --> 06:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
landlord the manager and or the
 
06:30:44.548 --> 06:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
maintenance people would come in and
 
06:30:46.628 --> 06:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
describe what needs to be done
 
06:30:48.948 --> 06:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:30:50.948 --> 06:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
you know what it could be pictures it
 
06:30:53.110 --> 06:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
could be just you know verbal testimony
 
06:30:55.110 --> 06:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know uh and
 
06:30:57.030 --> 06:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think it should be all that yeah
 
06:30:59.910 --> 06:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
all that difficult
 
06:31:01.910 --> 06:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
so if and i could just follow up on that
 
06:31:01.920 --> 06:31:03.910 align:start position:0%
so if and i could just follow up on that
because

06:31:03.910 --> 06:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:31:03.920 --> 06:31:04.628 align:start position:0%
because
it

06:31:04.628 --> 06:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:31:08.310 --> 06:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
seems to me if if the issue is that this
 
06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
is being used as a ruse and that's
 
06:31:12.708 --> 06:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
ultimately what the issue is and why we
 
06:31:16.310 --> 06:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
have to extend the eviction period
 
06:31:16.320 --> 06:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
have to extend the eviction period
why

06:31:17.990 --> 06:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:31:20.390 --> 06:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
instead of increasing the eviction
 
06:31:23.350 --> 06:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
period or the the notice period i should
 
06:31:25.510 --> 06:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
say in each case
 
06:31:27.990 --> 06:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
addressing the proof that needs to be
 
06:31:29.910 --> 06:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
supplied to the court in these
 
06:31:32.708 --> 06:31:32.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances sure let me if i could and
 
06:31:34.150 --> 06:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
then i'll address that in a minute but
 
06:31:36.150 --> 06:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
let me make real clear or repeat what i
 
06:31:37.910 --> 06:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
said at the beginning of my testimony
 
06:31:40.230 --> 06:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
this by and large is not about bad
 
06:31:42.150 --> 06:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
landlords and people doing this by and
 
06:31:43.990 --> 06:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
large it's just get to get people the
 
06:31:46.868 --> 06:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
time they need however
 
06:31:50.150 --> 06:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think what you are suggesting
 
06:31:51.990 --> 06:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
although as a lawyer i find that
 
06:31:54.310 --> 06:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
intriguing uh i think you're probably
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to get more
 
06:31:59.350 --> 06:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh a lot more uh blowback from the
 
06:32:01.190 --> 06:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
property owner community than you are
 
06:32:03.350 --> 06:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
with something that's you know this easy
 
06:32:03.360 --> 06:32:04.230 align:start position:0%
with something that's you know this easy
but

06:32:04.230 --> 06:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:32:06.150 --> 06:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
um you know it's certainly something
 
06:32:08.070 --> 06:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
that if the committee is interested we
 
06:32:11.110 --> 06:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh we could work on um but you know i
 
06:32:12.948 --> 06:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
mean if you think about it
 
06:32:15.190 --> 06:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
and this is what happens all the time
 
06:32:17.270 --> 06:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
right now the landlord simply comes in
 
06:32:19.430 --> 06:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
and says what his intentions are
 
06:32:21.270 --> 06:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
and it's like
 
06:32:23.190 --> 06:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to prove and that
 
06:32:25.030 --> 06:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
prove a negative like i come back in the
 
06:32:27.910 --> 06:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
court and say no you're not you know
 
06:32:29.510 --> 06:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
the one thing i have to work with is
 
06:32:31.910 --> 06:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
whether the landlord um issued the same
 
06:32:34.548 --> 06:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
eviction notices to the other tenants in
 
06:32:36.150 --> 06:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
the building but other than that i got
 
06:32:39.110 --> 06:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
nothing so it but you know if you can
 
06:32:41.030 --> 06:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
think of a way to
 
06:32:44.070 --> 06:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh to enhance that burden of proof i'd
 
06:32:45.750 --> 06:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
certainly be willing to work with you on
 
06:32:46.788 --> 06:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
it well
 
06:32:48.868 --> 06:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
and if i could just follow up more one
 
06:32:50.868 --> 06:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
more time and that is
 
06:32:53.190 --> 06:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
for example if you want to show
 
06:32:56.070 --> 06:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's committed malpractice
 
06:32:58.628 --> 06:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
you can't just come in and say they did
 
06:33:00.708 --> 06:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
something wrong you need to have an
 
06:33:03.430 --> 06:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
expert in the field say they did
 
06:33:05.110 --> 06:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice if
 
06:33:05.120 --> 06:33:05.990 align:start position:0%
malpractice if
if

06:33:05.990 --> 06:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:33:08.150 --> 06:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
you need to show that the repairs are
 
06:33:09.750 --> 06:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
necessary and people can't live in there
 
06:33:12.150 --> 06:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
it would seem that you ought to have a
 
06:33:14.548 --> 06:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
letter from a contractor saying that
 
06:33:16.548 --> 06:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
it's unsafe for people to reside in
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
there or if you're going to sell the
 
06:33:18.878 --> 06:33:19.830 align:start position:0%
there or if you're going to sell the
house

06:33:19.830 --> 06:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
house
 
06:33:20.948 --> 06:33:20.958 align:start position:0%
that the
 
06:33:23.350 --> 06:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
new owner your the agreement that you
 
06:33:24.948 --> 06:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
have with the new owner is that the
 
06:33:27.270 --> 06:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
premises be vacated
 
06:33:29.190 --> 06:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
so let me just step back a minute just
 
06:33:31.590 --> 06:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
so everybody understands
 
06:33:34.230 --> 06:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
if you give the 60 day notice under this
 
06:33:35.670 --> 06:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill you don't have to worry about it
 
06:33:37.990 --> 06:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
all you can still just go in and say you
 
06:33:40.708 --> 06:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
know this is my intention but to address
 
06:33:42.948 --> 06:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
your but if you want to go 30 right and
 
06:33:45.990 --> 06:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
and deal with this proof issue here the
 
06:33:47.270 --> 06:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
difference between this and a
 
06:33:50.390 --> 06:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
malpractice case and almost any other is
 
06:33:52.830 --> 06:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
that it's solely about the landlord's
 
06:33:56.310 --> 06:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
intention right and you it is very hard
 
06:33:58.390 --> 06:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
to say well no landlord you don't really
 
06:34:01.030 --> 06:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
intend to do this it's not about with a
 
06:34:03.110 --> 06:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice case or almost any other
 
06:34:06.548 --> 06:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
case the question is did x happen or not
 
06:34:08.628 --> 06:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
it's not did somebody inten you know
 
06:34:10.468 --> 06:34:10.478 align:start position:0%
with criminal cases you may get into
 
06:34:13.510 --> 06:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
intent but but the issue here is one
 
06:34:15.990 --> 06:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
that in order to get the benefit of this
 
06:34:20.070 --> 06:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
30-day exception if you will um
 
06:34:22.230 --> 06:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
you you've really got to show that the
 
06:34:25.190 --> 06:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
landlord's intention is not what he says
 
06:34:27.270 --> 06:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
it is but again i think in the vast
 
06:34:29.270 --> 06:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
majority of cases the landlord will give
 
06:34:31.190 --> 06:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
the 60-day notice the tenants will get
 
06:34:33.270 --> 06:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
the benefit of that and
 
06:34:34.788 --> 06:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
you know things will work the way they
 
06:34:36.548 --> 06:34:36.558 align:start position:0%
work now except the tenant gets more
 
06:34:36.558 --> 06:34:37.670 align:start position:0%
work now except the tenant gets more
time

06:34:37.670 --> 06:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:43.430 --> 06:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
i i should ask anybody else have any
 
06:34:45.110 --> 06:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
06:34:47.110 --> 06:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
attorney barry while he's up here thank
 
06:34:48.868 --> 06:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
you for
 
06:34:50.948 --> 06:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
second round
 
06:34:53.350 --> 06:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to testify
 
06:34:55.830 --> 06:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will close the hearing
 
06:34:57.910 --> 06:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
06:34:57.920 --> 06:35:00.708 align:start position:0%
on house bill
217

06:35:00.708 --> 06:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
217
 
06:35:00.718 --> 06:35:02.150 align:start position:0%
217
and

06:35:02.150 --> 06:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:35:03.750 --> 06:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
unless there's some other matters before
 
06:35:05.510 --> 06:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
the committee we'll be in recess until
 
06:35:15.150 --> 06:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:18.788 --> 06:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
morning if you say
 
06:35:21.110 --> 06:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
i have to do a renovation so you have to
 
06:35:23.110 --> 06:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
go while i do
 
06:35:25.830 --> 06:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that gives that
 
06:35:25.840 --> 06:35:27.510 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that gives that
priority

06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
priority
 
06:35:30.390 --> 06:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
when that comes back on the market
 
06:35:33.750 --> 06:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
right right right so no so so even if
 
06:35:35.750 --> 06:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
they couldn't afford the increased rent
 
06:35:38.150 --> 06:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're not given priority that's right
 
06:35:39.750 --> 06:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that i'm aware of that
 
06:36:23.110 --> 06:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:23.120 --> 06:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
you
