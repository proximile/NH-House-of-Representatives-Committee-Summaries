oh sorry no problem no problem
 
00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.490 align:start position:0%
oh sorry no problem no problem
um

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do first and again
 
00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
just this is I mean I know I know many
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
of you some obviously much better than
 
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
others but some of you I don't know and
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
I suspect that you may not know each
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
other particularly if you're if you're
 
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
new so um what I'd like to do uh
 
00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 align:start position:0%
initially is just uh to ask everyone uh
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
to sort of go around the table ask
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
everyone to just sort of introduce
 
00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.689 align:start position:0%
everyone to just sort of introduce
yourself

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
um who you are where you're from how
 
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
long you've been in the legislature
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
um why you chose Judiciary if you did
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe some of you didn't and that's
 
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
fine too uh
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
um what you hope to accomplish uh and I
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
I guess I would say not only on this
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee but if there are you know if
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
you have if there are important pieces
 
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
of legislation that that are going to be
 
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
before other committees that you think
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
are really important you've sponsored or
 
00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
you have an interest in you tell us
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
about that also
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
um and then I the other the last thing
 
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
is any particular expertise that you
 
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
think you have that may be helpful to
 
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
the committee that might be something
 
00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful uh uh to myself uh
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
and vice chair Wallace and the ranking
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh member Smith in term if we need to
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
assign subcommittees or something like
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
that it would be important to know
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
people that have particular interests or
 
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
particular expertise so uh maybe we
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
could start with representative
 
00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.450 align:start position:0%
could start with representative
testerman

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
if you press the red if the red on the
 
00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 align:start position:0%
right there you go okay
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
um and this is my fourth term at uh the
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
state house uh I've sat on the criminal
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
law committee for the first three uh I
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
am not a lawyer I'm actually an engineer
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh but I uh I've enjoyed this kind of
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
of uh things to study whether it be
 
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.220 align:start position:0%
judicial or or
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
criminal law uh
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
I would say set in bonus or set in
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
opinions except that I do believe in the
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh and I don't believe that
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
it should be modified all right at least
 
00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:22.379 align:start position:0%
modified without a formal procedure uh
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not here to judge make
 
00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:28.099 align:start position:0%
judgments on it it either is or it isn't
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%

the education aspects and I also have a
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of an interest in some of the
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
election laws and just being more
 
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.409 align:start position:0%
election laws and just being more
transparent

00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
so that's what I hope to accomplish
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman great thank you hi
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
um so uh my name is Bob Lin I'm also
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
from Windham I'm in my uh second term uh
 
00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
first term is being chairman and I guess
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
what I would say is I have some
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
experience in the law but I don't have
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
any experience in being chairman of uh
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
of a house committee so I will I'm I'm
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
definitely in the learning mode myself
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
and I will be looking to all of you and
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
particularly to the ranking member and
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
to the uh the vice chair for assistance
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
and advice and guidance I'm more than
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
willing to to listen to any of you if
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
you have questions if you have questions
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
concerns whatever this is a learning
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
experience for me also I
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
I spent a long time as a judge on both a
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
trial judge and a appellate judge in New
 
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:24.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retired about three years ago
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
when I turned 70
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
um I I have uh two bills uh that I
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
believe actually three that I believe
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
will come before uh this committee one
 
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:38.780 align:start position:0%
is a proposed Constitutional Amendment
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh to raise the retirement age of Judges
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
from 70 to 75 that I introduced that
 
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
bill last year it did not go anywhere
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that it'll have better fate
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh a better fate this year I also have a
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh uh that will come before this
 
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
committee to establish a superior court
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
land use docket where judges will be
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
appointed to that will sort of
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
specialize in that area and I think
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of the one of the ideas
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
behind that is to kind of streamline the
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
process of getting thing land use
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
decisions that are appealed to the
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
courts getting them heard more quickly
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
and more uh more efficiently so that's
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
another one and then I also have a
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant bill that
 
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.529 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant bill that
um

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:30.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
that again I think it actually I believe
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
last year it did pass the house but was
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
killed in the Senate it basically deals
 
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.409 align:start position:0%
killed in the Senate it basically deals
with

00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
there is what in my view and I've I
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
understand people may have different
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
views in this but in my view a
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
sort of crazy Supreme Court case from
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
the 1980s that basically says if you
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
have a leased for a year
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
of restricted property the term of the
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
lease doesn't matter it's uh you uh the
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
landlord cannot terminate the tenancy
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
simply because the lease is up if
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
there's no other reason to terminate it
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
that uh to me doesn't make much sense
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
there was a dissent by Justice Netto in
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
that case which I thought was a very
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
well reasoned descent so anyway I've
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
I've basically I have a bit has a have a
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill that would propose to overrule that
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so I um I and I also am very
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
interested in bail somebody else here
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned bail I'm I'm very concerned
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
about bail issues I have a an issue on
 
00:21:41.159 --> 00:21:42.649 align:start position:0%
about bail issues I have a an issue on
bail

00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
bail
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
um that will go to criminal justice and
 
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.669 align:start position:0%
um that will go to criminal justice and
lastly

00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:47.350 align:start position:0%
lastly
um

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh my my lifelong hobby has been uh
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
target shooting I'm very interested in
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
you know I'm a very Avid uh Firearms
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
owner I've I've a very strong proponent
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
of the Second Amendment and uh so I have
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh I you know that will be those kind of
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
issues are things that I will be uh
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
particularly focusing on even though
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
they may not come before this committee
 
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm Marjorie Smith
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
this is my 13th term
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
people ask me why I keep on running and
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
I have a very easy answer I keep on
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
running until we get it right and we
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten it right yet uh and so
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
here I am
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
um those of you who are freshmen and are
 
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
understandably nervous I can tell you
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
that I learned something new every day
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
and sometimes I learned five new things
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
in a day
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's exciting and it's
 
00:23:00.659 --> 00:23:02.630 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's exciting and it's
challenging

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
um what I missed immediately on this
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
committee is our former clerk because he
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
knew how to adjust the chairs so they
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
were the right height right now I feel
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm sitting with my chin on the
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
table and it is very uncomfortable so if
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
any of you know how to adjust chairs
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
please see me afterwards
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I do oh thank goodness
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I too believe in um in the Second
 
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.570 align:start position:0%
um I too believe in um in the Second
Amendment

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.529 align:start position:0%
Amendment
um

00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
and my interpretation of the Second
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment might just differ a little
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
from um the chairs uh belief in the
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment but on many of those
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
issues I believe my position is
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
supported by the majority of the the
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state including gun
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
owners and that has to do with
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
responsible gun ownership
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
but that's not an issue that comes
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
before this committee that's just kind
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
of icing on the cake on the side
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
um I am a very firm believer in personal
 
00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.289 align:start position:0%
um I am a very firm believer in personal
privacy

00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
and in the rights of individuals
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh and I realized how complicated these
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
issues are and when a bill comes in here
 
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
and you look at the title and you say oh
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
yes I'm with that a hundred percent
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
and then you read the text
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
and you find out that what you thought
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
this bill was about it isn't so so my
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
single advice to everybody on the
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee new and old is be open to
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
everything that comes here before the
 
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.529 align:start position:0%
everything that comes here before the
committee

00:24:50.529 --> 00:24:50.539 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
and redo your homework read the bills
 
00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:58.580 align:start position:0%
talk to people who know about the issues
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
and wait a bit before you make your
 
00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.830 align:start position:0%
and wait a bit before you make your
judgment

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I have I have divided my time in
 
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
those 13 terms between this committee
 
00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:12.059 align:start position:0%
and finance and when they say it's not
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
it's always the money
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
I look forward to working with all of
 
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.850 align:start position:0%
I look forward to working with all of
you

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Louise Andrus I
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
am from Salisbury I represent Merrimack
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
County District 5 Andover Danbury Hill
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
Salisbury and Webster this is my second
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
term but I feel like a freshman because
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
the first term was so much remote and

we all each and every one of us need to
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%

with everything that's in it but um
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
I believe that it was written for a
 
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
reason as our Constitution of the United
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
got involved in doing this because I had
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
a group a huge group of parents that I
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%

00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
closet and they dug it out when I came
 
00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
back and so I swept in office in in
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
2008 along with my fellow Columbia
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
alumnus uh Barack Obama who I knew a
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
little bit but I didn't pay much
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
attention to him he uh he studied a lot
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
more than I did and got into the Harvard
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
Law School and he's president but I'm
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
but I'm here so that's nothing to be
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
ashamed of I've been just starting my
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
eighth term it's my sixth term of this
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
committee before that I was um I started
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
on an election law which
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
back before I was a rep I'm spending a
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
lot of time agitating for democracy and
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
the rule of law and also an issue which
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
never seems to go away which is the
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the of the voting machines
 
00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.690 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the of the voting machines
and

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.470 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
and then actually it's appropriate today
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
we have a bill about a granny D-Day so
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
she was a local uh she's a local
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
activist she's famous Nation invited
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
worldwide so urge you all to vote for
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
that bill when it comes to the house
 
00:33:39.179 --> 00:33:40.310 align:start position:0%
that bill when it comes to the house
stuff

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
um then in between election law and this
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
committee is on something called the
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
petitions and redress committee which
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
was mostly aggrieved
 
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
family law
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
family law lit against most of whom
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
I mean you could probably
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
most it's quite easy especially for
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
Resident per se to get yourself into a
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
bit of a bit of a pickle particularly if
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
you're on the wrong side of your lawn in
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
many cases you were these were men
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
Sometimes women who weren't paying to
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
child support or not doing other other
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
things and it's a terrible situation for
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
them but to some extent uh
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
someone said there's not much you can do
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
about us so the committee didn't do much
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
about that was when I first learned the
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
existence of a representative Lynn back
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
then I think you were still a superior
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
court judge and uh you were you're very
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
you're very nice guy you're an excellent
 
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
choice to share but I've seen some
 
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
videos where like you know if you're if
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
you're actually on creating someone in
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
the courtroom you were very firm with
 
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
them so and I I I I understand 100 of
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
why you had to do that sometimes and uh
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
you mentioned your constitutional
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
amendment my first term I tried to
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate the age limit for for judges
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
that felt just a little shorter we
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
needed 240 votes to pass it through the
 
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
house we got uh 200 vote 40 votes
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
against it so uh it's a I don't know if
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
the numbers have changed much than that
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
but good luck with that one and um
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of my uh career outside the
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislature as a writer and a computer
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
consultant for while I was working in a
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
group that's available in the technical
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
standards for the the metaverse which
 
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
you occasionally hear about but probably
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
not much of you have actually uh visited
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
it and um
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
and for a while it's also working for
 
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
the educational testing firm
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
um which at that time is no measure
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
progress I think they've been bought up
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
by somebody so if any of you are in
 
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
school in the early 2000s or at
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
Children's school so my my apologies uh
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
the testing was a little bit uh I don't
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with everything they
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
did with the testing but that's a matter
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
of the education committee so um
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
Church of my legislative priorities I'm
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
very strongly in favor of uh
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
individual freedom in terms of rule of
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
law democracy um on the other hand I am
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh I mean certainly I believe in the
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment as written but I'm not
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
sure but I'm I think that uh I think
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
gunned Common Sense gun safety policies
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
are not unconstitutional and that's uh
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
probably what the Supreme Court has
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
generally helped and um
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
so it should be
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
should be a should be an interesting uh
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
interesting session I'm glad to be back
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
because a number of us uh were here last
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
term either weren't reelected and I won
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
my primary by just four votes and had to
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
go to a recount and or
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
some of them have been moved to other
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
committees so like there's like a lot of
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of new faces here which I guess
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
is uh I guess it's good and also I'm
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
from Durham and a majority of the Durham
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
delegation has I think almost the whole
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
time we've been in judiciary we've had a
 
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
majority of the Durham delegation on the
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee so that's just sort
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
of one of these strange little
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
traditions we have here at the house so
 
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh because it's also President Kennedy
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
who haven't met yet but you'll meet him
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
soon enough and he's so thanks
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%

than most human retired mechanic and

helicopter pilot so I'm looking to
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
learning uh some of the new the subject
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
and it turns out probably about half the
 
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
bills that are presented in some way
 
00:38:52.569 --> 00:38:52.579 align:start position:0%
interact with the judicial branch either
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh have a fiscal impact up on the branch
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
which is what you'll hear a lot from me
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
um they require some modifications to
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
our processes so I talk about those my
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
goal in terms of my presentations to any
 
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
committee is to provide sort of the
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
perspective of the judicial branch in
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
terms of how bills interact with the
 
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.109 align:start position:0%
terms of how bills interact with the
branch

00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
um in terms of my background I've been
 
00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
in this position for uh three years now
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
um my practice was divided about half of
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
my uh years of practice was in uh in
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
private practice in New Hampshire and
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
about half of it was at the Attorney
 
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:35.300 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
at the Attorney General's office and in
 
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
private practice the vast majority of
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
that has been uh on the Civil side of
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
the fence so at the AG's office I was
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
the consumer bureau chief I was the
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
environmental bureau chief and then I
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
oversaw the Civil side of the office for
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
a while
 
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.329 align:start position:0%
a while
um

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know I had in my practice I had the
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to appear in front of
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
Justice Lynn both when he was a spirit
 
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
court judge and as a Supreme Court Judge
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
Justice uh you're very lucky he's a very
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
fair uh uh individual he fortunately
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
listens uh and is a great listener
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
didn't always rule my way but I never
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
hold that against anyone I recognize
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
that there are differing views and I
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
think during the course of my
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
presentations we will probably have
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
differing views but my goal is always to
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
try to present factual information
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
and information that that reflects how
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch is impacted by
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
legislation that appears before you I'm
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
always available to answer questions I
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
encourage anyone to call me anytime if
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
you have questions or if you see me in
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
the hallways feel free always to stop me
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
and ask me anything about
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
things of interest to you A lot of the
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
times I say I don't know I have to get
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
back to you and I try to get back to you
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
whenever I I don't know the answer to a
 
00:40:53.099 --> 00:40:53.810 align:start position:0%
whenever I I don't know the answer to a
question

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
but thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
letting me introduce myself thank you
 
00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579 align:start position:0%
and you know could I uh just uh sort of
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
a as a matter of maybe an informational
 
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.990 align:start position:0%
a as a matter of maybe an informational
matter

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
um am I correct Mr head that
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
it will often be the case that the
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
judicial branch on some particular issue
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
will be will be coming to provide us
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
simply with information not without sort
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
of taking a position on whether they
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
think the legislation is good or not
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
um even even if the even if sort of you
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
know internally some members of the of
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch may think it is
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
either a good idea or a bad idea
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
based upon my experience often if uh
 
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
unless it's something that's you know
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
really would have a tremendously
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
detrimental effect on the Judiciary the
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
court is likely to say this is a policy
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
matter for the legislature and we don't
 
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
here here's what you should know but we
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
don't take a position am I am I is that
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
still basically what the court does it's
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
a fair point so in terms of of the the
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
bills that impact us we do try not to
 
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
get involved in the underlying policy
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
I've had some some conversations with
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:42:07.849 --> 00:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
if I can I try to say that we support or
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
oppose a particular aspect of a bill but
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
there are frequently instances in which
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
we don't have a position on the policy
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
of the bill you may hear me testify in a
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
way that sounds positive or sounds
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
negative because
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a bill which has a a policy
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
purpose we don't have a position on will
 
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
have a significant impact on the
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branch so I would be testifying
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
not about the policy itself but to try
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
to it's sort of how
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
a bill will have an impact on resources
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
within the branch so if a particular
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
Bill were to pass so for example if it
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
required us to hear certain types of
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
cases in 30 days okay we can we can do
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
that but then the impact on that is
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to be we can't hear other cases
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
that are discretionary because we have
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
to move cases up in this session they're
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
probably 15 bills
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
that put in deadlines in terms of when
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
the court is supposed to hear things and
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
that is is a policy position and what my
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
presentation would typically be is you
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
know there are certain number of cases
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
that fall in that category we have to
 
00:43:29.569 --> 00:43:29.579 align:start position:0%
move those cases forward so as a result
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know we can only hear so many cases
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
in a day so other cases that we do not
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
have a statutory or constitutional
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
mandate to hear quickly are going to get
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
pushed and we've seen that and we see
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
that with bills so that's the type of
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
information I might provide and it may
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
sound negative I don't mean it to sound
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
negative it is simply it has an impact
 
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
on the on the court system and I try to
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
explain how that impacts operations
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Andrew any any
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
representative have any questions for Mr
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
head as I say we're not here on any
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
particular bills but if you have any
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
sort of general questions uh
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
this is the time
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much also I learned
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
from representative Smith that any
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
exhibits I hand out will have three
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
holes punched in
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great idea an
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
excellent just also one one other thing
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
I have to go to uh house criminal
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
justice you'll see frequently when I'm
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
here I'm going back and forth because
 
00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they're meeting at the
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you yes thank you
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
if I could just say that I'm delighted
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
that I've had so much influence on on
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
Miss Mr head I'd like him to have more
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
influence on us because he has knowledge
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
and experience that many of us don't
 
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
have and the implications of something
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
that looks quite innocent to us might
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
not in fact be innocent and that's why
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
I push you sometimes and I know it makes
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
you uncomfortable but I believe it's in
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
the best interests of the citizens of
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr head
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
um I I know that there are a number of
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
other people in the audience I'm
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
wondering are there any are there any
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
other people here that rep that are
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
represent sort of state agencies of one
 
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
kind or another that may be appearing
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
before us with some regularity if if
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's the case and you'd like to
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
all right uh seeing none uh then let me
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
um let me just sort of turn to some
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
Logistics uh
 
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.410 align:start position:0%
Logistics uh
um

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
as you know I sent out a memo and um
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
originally my memo said we're gonna meet
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday mornings hear the bills and
 
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
then the following Wednesday we'll hear
 
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
the we'll hear more bills and on
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
Wednesday mornings and we'll have
 
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:12.020 align:start position:0%
executive sessions in the afternoon
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative Smith very wisely quickly
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
educated me that that probably is not
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
likely to work given uh the extent of
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
given our workload basically
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
so it's more likely that at least in the
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
beginning we're going to be hearing
 
00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.230 align:start position:0%
beginning we're going to be hearing
bills

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
um for full days on Wednesdays and it it
 
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
seems from from
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
the schedule that was that was used last
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
year and actually that was the second
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
year which is generally less less busy
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
than the first last year the Judiciary
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
Committee tended to generally met two
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
days a week I think it's very likely
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to do that also
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
and so my my inclination would be that
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
we would meet on Wednesdays and
 
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
we would meet on Wednesdays and
Thursdays

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
Thursdays
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
Thursdays it will generally be the day
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
when that when the Full House meets not
 
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
every week but so we're obviously on a
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
week when the Full House is meeting we
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
can't meet on Thursdays but on other
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
days on other weeks that would be my
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
inclination is to have us meet on
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
Thursdays uh
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
um but I'm you know again if if uh if
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
somebody tells me Thursday is absolutely
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
the worst possible day and we have some
 
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
as a really you know I'm I'm open but
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not bear in mind this room is used
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
on Tuesdays by children and family and
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
on Fridays by state federal relations so
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
that basically means that Monday and
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
Thursday is the and I think Thursday is
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
probably the one that makes the most
 
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.730 align:start position:0%
probably the one that makes the most
sense

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh Mr human yes
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
um what time do you envision that we'll
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
meet on Wednesdays
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
starting time yeah I would generally say
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
 
00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.170 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
um

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
other other questions
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander thank you
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so typically in the past um and
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to you but the chair
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
um grouped together similar bills for
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
public hearings was that your intention
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
just so we could allow the public maybe
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
one day if say they're interested in
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
um you know any bills uh regarding
 
00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
abortion like they could come in that
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
day and so they don't have to come
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
multiple days was that still your
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
intention yes absolutely so I'm um I
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
I've as of yesterday I believe I I when
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
I or not yesterday Monday I'm sorry
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
um uh we had there were 29 bills that I
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
was given copies of now I understand
 
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's grown since then uh it's third up
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
to 38.
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
um but what I saw as I went through them
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
is I I came to sort of three groupings
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
one was there's a bunch of landlord
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
Senate bills there's a bunch of right to
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
know bills and there's a bunch of
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
abortion bills so I do I agree
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
completely uh representative Alexander
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
that we should we should group those
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
together and hear them
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
um you know hear them all on the same
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
day you should know that I have already
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
scheduled for next week I've scheduled
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
hearings on eight bills and I violated
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
that and because I those those seem like
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that were the most likely to be
 
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:14.990 align:start position:0%
the ones that were the most likely to be
um

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term non-com in my
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
judgment non-controversial either they
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
were you know they seemed to me to be
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
either very good or very bad
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
um but but uh that and that may that may
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
not be that right and I'm not going to
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
tell you and that may not be you may all
 
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
have a completely different view on that
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
you may say all the ones that I thought
 
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
were bad they're good and all the ones
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
that I thought were good were bad but I
 
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
would say that I I among those I did
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
include one bill
 
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
um that dealt with landlord tenant it
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
was actually my the bill I talked about
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
before about the termination of tenancy
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
at the end of a lease but that's the
 
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
only one I so
 
00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
um with that kind of exception I I would
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
plan to schedule
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
um our hearing or you know to group
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
bills by subject matter
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and I think probably
 
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
um and I think probably
um

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the abortion my inclination is that
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
for the abortion bills we should
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
probably try to do that in the house
 
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
because we'll have uh we'll have you
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
know a number a number of witnesses
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative you mean in reps hole
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
that's all yes and I think that's
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
probably a wise a wise decision and
 
00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:29.540 align:start position:0%
again group them together so that
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
citizens who are interested Advocates
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
um legislators know they're there for
 
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.710 align:start position:0%
um legislators know they're there for
the

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
the Long Haul
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
um I I wonder
 
00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.450 align:start position:0%
um I I wonder
um

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
um you and the staff support that you
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
have could double check to see if you in
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
fact have any early bills because those
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
bills will have to be heard first and
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
you should have the Chairman's copy by
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
now of bills and if you don't you might
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
want to check with the clerk's office
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
I also would ask I think on behalf of
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
all of us that you don't schedule these
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
from week to week in that meaning that
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
if you can schedule
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
15 bills for the next two two weeks or
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
three weeks or whatever it happens to be
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
give us as much notice as possible and
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
give the public as much notice as
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
possible that you're going to be hearing
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
the right to know bills on such and such
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
a date okay
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's a girl I had not thought that's a
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
very good idea and I I mean that does
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
that make that makes sense to everybody
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
all right well that's what I'll do
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you absolutely
 
00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:48.049 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you absolutely
okay

00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
um oh yes well I'm sorry yes
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan well this is uh I
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
mean I guess we'll know more the answer
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
to this when we start actually having
 
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
hearings scheduled when the calendar
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
comes out on Thursday but they've
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
revived the remote sign in from last
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
session where you can say you're either
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
four or against a bill and you can
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
submit preferably an Adobe PDF format a
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
copy of your of your testimony and last
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
year you could then the public anybody a
 
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
member or any member of the public could
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
see a list of who signed in for against
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
and if they submit a testimony could
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
download their testimony and now that um
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
at least so far is not being done this
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
year so how how will we be able to
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
what's your mechanism exists so we can
 
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:32.339 align:start position:0%
see the uh
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
we can see the files they submit a
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
testimony the names of who signed in for
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
against and also a related question is
 
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.670 align:start position:0%
against and also a related question is
how

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
how should Witnesses uh
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
submit their testimony does it is email
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
testimony gonna be including the bill
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
files in this committee or do you have
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
to do a printed file or submitted
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
through the portal so I don't
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm part of what are their choices in
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
terms of submitting written testimony to
 
00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.750 align:start position:0%
terms of submitting written testimony to
us

00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
so I um
 
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not sure that it has been
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
finalized yet to Beyond to be honest
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
with you but those are all good
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
questions we'll we'll figure out the
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
we'll find the answers to that
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah so I I mean stay tuned I
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
oh maybe representative kuchoff hasn't
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
answered so yesterday I attended the
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
clerks training and clerk Smith let us
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
know that it will be at the discretion
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the chair whether or not to accept a
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
particular piece of email testimony but
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
as a general rule
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
we should be utilizing the portal which
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
you can actually currently view for
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
every Bill what is submitted so it is
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
actually up and running
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
for for people to use but it was just
 
00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
getting really hard to track via email
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes people will use a
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
computer service that you know like a
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
jot form that's sending out thousands
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
from many people and it was just really
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
difficult to track how many people were
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
for or against and and using the online
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
just makes it much easier
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay so that's so that has been decided
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
okay yes uh representative thank you Mr
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
chair I have a question on the housing
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
bills I noticed well yesterday that um
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
Judiciary post-judiciary Silo but I
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
understand that there's a special
 
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
housing committee and was wondering you
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
know are the lean on tenants Bill going
 
00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:35.099 align:start position:0%
to be here are they going to be heard in
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh the special housing committee
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that we're coming
 
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
here but representative Alexander maybe
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
you you may have more information on
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
that than I do
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I thank you Mr chair I have a feeling
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we're going to hear those here but
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
I also know there are a number of
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
members of this committee that also sit
 
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
on the special committee and I think
 
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.150 align:start position:0%
on the special committee and I think
that

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
um if needed we should consult with that
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
special committee on certain bills
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
especially if we're undecided on
 
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.109 align:start position:0%
especially if we're undecided on
something

00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
um maybe bring them in and have joint
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
committees or whatever whatever you
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
whatever the discretion of the chair is
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
um especially on like the bigger like
 
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
the bigger more intensive bills maybe
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
like Land review DACA something like
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
that like bring in their expertise as
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
well sure that makes sense to me that
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:24.829 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
so I was just wondering in general so
 
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
for example your bill to uh terminate
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
tenancy at the expiration of the tenancy
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
or the lease term
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
how would we have the citation to the
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court decision so
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
that we could kind of consider that and
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
put that sure you know what I I don't I
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
I don't have it off the top of my head
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
but I you know when I testify to
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill I will have that I
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
I have it at home I just didn't bring it
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
with me but uh okay it's um I wish I
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
could remember the name of it I think
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's decided
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
I said I said mid 80s I might be I may
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
be wrong on that it might be it might be
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
mid 90s but anyway I do remember uh
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
but in general
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
um I know we have a researcher
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
um is that a question we could ask the
 
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.630 align:start position:0%
um is that a question we could ask the
researcher

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
there are 20 of us and
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
um we can generate a lot of questions
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the procedure in the house for
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
obvious reasons is if you have a
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
question of the researcher you go
 
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:41.579 align:start position:0%
through the chair of the committee and
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
the chair is the person who can ask the
 
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
researcher to do all kinds of things
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
including uh for example side by side
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
comparisons of different bills and and
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
other issues however there are other
 
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
resources the um office of legislative
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
Services doesn't only draft bills they
 
00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
also have a whole section where there
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
are people there
 
00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
very happy to answer questions that you
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
might have so you go down there first
 
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
floor of the um of the state house and
 
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
those uh people are on the if you're
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
facing where the OLS is there on the far
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
right and you can just go in and say I
 
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
have a question can you help me research
 
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
this and they will do that for you so
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
there are other possible the third place
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
to go is
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
um they're lobbyists they're Advocates
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
some wear orange badges particularly if
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
they're paid but not only if they're
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
paid others don't and one of the things
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
that you will learn
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
and I hope I offend No One by saying
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
this some of those
 
00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
people are incredibly helpful they will
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
be absolutely accurate and they won't
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
spin and they'll say this is what this
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
is there then they might even tell you
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
the other side might think that and some
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
of those people are not completely
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
accurate and by talking to your
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
colleagues and by your own experience
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
you'll learn who you can rely on it's
 
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
something we do more in this state than
 
00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
in many other states because we do not
 
00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:31.910 align:start position:0%
in many other states because we do not
have

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:32.630 align:start position:0%
have
um

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
the overly generous staff support and so
 
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
so so in answer to your you know your
 
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
specific way I mean I will
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
um uh in fact I can you know I will when
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
I go home I can uh I'll get the case and
 
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
I can just I can email you the name of
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
the case it's uh
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to have where I already
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
have the information there's no sense in
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
asking the researcher to look it up
 
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.089 align:start position:0%
asking the researcher to look it up
again

00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:59:02.099 --> 00:59:02.750 align:start position:0%
again
um

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.410 align:start position:0%
um so
um

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
so as I say our usual meeting day will
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
be Wednesday I will generally start at 9
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
00 a.m uh we'll we'll
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure we're gonna need to use to
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
to be hearing bills on Thursdays also so
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
I think you can kind of generally plan
 
00:59:23.089 --> 00:59:23.099 align:start position:0%
that we'll be sitting on Wednesdays and
 
00:59:23.099 --> 00:59:24.770 align:start position:0%
that we'll be sitting on Wednesdays and
Thursdays

00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
Thursdays
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
um with the exception of days when the
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
Full House is meeting on Thursdays
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I would ask you um to please be here
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
and be on time obviously if there's you
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
know if there you have medical
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
appointments or other things like that
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
you know that there's going to cause you
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
to be late we understand but if but
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
barring something really important to
 
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
ask you to be here and be on time and if
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
for some reason you can't be here
 
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
please either let me know or let the
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
ranking member know so that we can
 
00:59:56.049 --> 00:59:56.059 align:start position:0%
arrange to have a substitute for you
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
as I understand the rules we don't need
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
to have a quorum to hold hearings but
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
obviously we do need to we do need to
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
have a quorum for executive sessions and
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
so it's particularly important uh in
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
executive sessions that we that
 
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
everybody be here unless there's really
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
a very strong reason not to be here and
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
if you can't be here let you know either
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
me know if you're if uh if you're in the
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
majority majority party or let the
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
ranking member know if you are in the
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
minority party so that substitutes can
 
01:00:34.569 --> 01:00:34.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's right 24 hours
 
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
and also you have to actually be absent
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
from the state house so you're not
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
allowed to be
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
get a substitute but then still be in
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
the State House doing something else so
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
if I understand the rules correctly no
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
that's right if you're gone you're gone
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
for the day that's that's right as I
 
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.809 align:start position:0%
for the day that's that's right as I
understand

01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I'd like to do is I
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
really would like to encourage all
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
members to be active
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
um uh you know please uh we if you have
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
questions and you're interested in
 
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
something don't don't hesitate to ask
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
I'll uh I'll you know I'm not inclined
 
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
to uh in any way to prevent any members
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
of this committee from asking questions
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
where they have questions
 
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:17.870 align:start position:0%
where they have questions
um

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
I would I would say please let's make
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
sure that we treat all people that come
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
before the committee and treat each
 
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
other with respect and dignity at all
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
times uh
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
um that's what everybody has the right
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
to uh you know the right to uh insist
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
upon and I and I certainly would would
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
insist upon it and I would I would say
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
you know if you're uh at the time for my
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
view is the time for us to debate is
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
during executive sessions that's when
 
01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to have a debate it's
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
not a good idea to have a debate with a
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
witness in other words you if you have
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
questions certainly ask the questions
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
and if you if the if you're not
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
satisfied with you know an answer or the
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
answer is incomplete don't hesitate to
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
ask for a follow-up question but you
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
know I that it it can't turn into a
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
debate with the witness that's just very
 
01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.609 align:start position:0%
debate with the witness that's just very
unproductive

01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
unproductive
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
um and we'll we'll end up wasting a lot
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
of time so I'd encourage that you know
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
please please don't do that
 
01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:18.170 align:start position:0%
please please don't do that
um

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
other things that I
 
01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:23.210 align:start position:0%
other things that I
generally

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and I've talked with representative
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
Smith about this and I believe she
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
agrees but if I'm if I'm if I'm wrong
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sure she'll correct me the the
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
procedure we'll follow is the bill
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
sponsor will testify first
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
um then my practice would be that if
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
there are other Representatives or
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
Senators here who have somewhere else to
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
go and you know that they they have
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
another hearing that they need to attend
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
to or either on another bill or they're
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
or they have other committee work then I
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
would I would give them preference to
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
testify next but if they don't
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
um then I would then I would my
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
inclination would be not to give them a
 
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
preference and just to go with people
 
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
who have who may have you know other uh
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
other uh places to be themselves uh
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
particularly if uh if some if they're
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
people that are that are
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term I would I
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
would refer to them as sort of experts
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
that maybe are being paid from by one by
 
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
one person or another
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I would tend to to go with those
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
people next and then generally members
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
of the public but I'm you know that's
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
that would be generally my inclination
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'm open to if people have different
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
views on that I'm open to uh to hearing
 
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.690 align:start position:0%
views on that I'm open to uh to hearing
those

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.569 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
again as I said I
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
my inclination is to let everybody say
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
their peace I I would prefer not to have
 
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
time limits but I'm I'm very concerned
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
that with many bills it'll be necessary
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
to have time limits and so I will try to
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know enforce the time limits
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
fairly if we say three minutes maybe the
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor gets five minutes and everybody
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
else gets three or something like that
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
and I will I will enforce that across
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
the board whether somebody's testifying
 
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
in support of a bill or uh opposed to a
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill and that will hopefully keep us
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
generally on time uh so that we get
 
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
um we get through our work
 
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.870 align:start position:0%
um we get through our work
um

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I have a question
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I sponsored a bill so I will have to
 
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.569 align:start position:0%
um I sponsored a bill so I will have to
um

01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
present that bill at some point
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
um if it doesn't interfere with any of
 
01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
our meetings that's great but if it will
 
01:04:56.289 --> 01:04:56.299 align:start position:0%
interfere how exactly is that handled
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
yeah you can be no you will be excused
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
to to testify on that to testify on that
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
bill I've got you know I've got the same
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
situation I'm going to have uh I'm going
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
to have some bills in other committees
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
that I'll have to excuse myself so we
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
should just let you know ahead just let
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
me know yeah just let me know and I have
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
one more question and it's just a
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to have a drink in here
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to have food in here I
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know what that was like I
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
brought in almonds because I didn't have
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
a chance to have breakfast this morning
 
01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
and I'm sneaking them over here and
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
popping them in my mouth but I want to
 
01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:32.420 align:start position:0%
know what's allowed ready
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
sneaky my understanding of the practice
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
has been and this was the way it was on
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
finance last year and I think it was the
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
way I was on this committee you can
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
bring in water okay that's kind of it no
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
no uh you know no other drinks and no
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
other food okay
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
containments no no Brandy containers
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay well I don't know Brandy contains
 
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.049 align:start position:0%
okay well I don't know Brandy contains
but

01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
um again it's just a question of being
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
respectful to the people who are here
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
um if we're having an informal meeting
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
whether a caucus or just a discussion
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
you know that's different but when we're
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
conducting hearings when we're voting
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
um it's just a sign of respect yes that
 
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
was that that was what we were told
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
initially I just wanted to clarify that
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
that too was the truth now thank you but
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
speaking of of that if I could add at
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
this time if you go into the office I
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if the draws have been newly
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
labeled yet
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
um it that will have to be done perhaps
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
by Karen or somebody else you each have
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
your own draw you will also my children
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
my grandchildren say I don't pronounce
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
that word correctly but you know what I
 
01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.609 align:start position:0%
that word correctly but you know what I
mean

01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:06:43.619 --> 01:06:44.630 align:start position:0%
mean
um

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
um you will also find a a coffee machine
 
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:51.140 align:start position:0%
in the office
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
and it's all equipped the only thing is
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
I I didn't find those little
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
milk things other than that I mean
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
there's coffee and sugar and it's
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
available for all Judiciary Committee
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
members there is a note there that says
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
if you just can't resist and you're not
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
a Judiciary member please leave a dollar
 
01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.650 align:start position:0%
a Judiciary member please leave a dollar
uh

01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh but so that at any point you know
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
that you might have to leave to
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
um to make a phone call or you just
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
can't stand it anymore and you've got to
 
01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:23.579 align:start position:0%
stretch your legs and you want a cup of
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
um so the the other uh thing I want to
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
talk about is uh basically when when
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
once we get to Executive sessions and
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
we've we're we're voting on bills
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
um uh then I will uh try to disperse
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
evenly uh you know if if we're if we're
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
not divided if it's going to be if if
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
we're unanimous or you're nearly
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous I will try to disperse evenly
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
among all the members of the committee
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility for writing uh reports on
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
the bill reports on the bills if we're
 
01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.370 align:start position:0%
the bill reports on the bills if we're
divided

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
divided
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
um then I again will will uh we'll try
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
to fairly distribute among the the
 
01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
majority party responsibility for
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
writing the bills and I'm sure
 
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Smith will do the same
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
for uh the minority and I just I I'm
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
suspecting here I I think it's probably
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
accurate that there may be a number of
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
matters in which the committee has no
 
01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
recommendation because we're equally
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
divided I suspect that that may that
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
that may happen
 
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
um uh I'd like to word it another way if
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
I could Mr chair I suspect that in the
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
majority of bills that come before this
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee we are either unanimous or
 
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
nearly unanimous because that is in all
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
my experience that has been true there
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
are a few areas
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
where that is not likely to happen but I
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
think that will be the minority of of
 
01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.530 align:start position:0%
think that will be the minority of of
bills

01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
um and I think that the tone that you're
 
01:09:08.769 --> 01:09:08.779 align:start position:0%
setting starting right now about
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
evenness and fairness and inclusion for
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to help remind all of
 
01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:19.699 align:start position:0%
us that while there are a few issues
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we feel so strongly about and that
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another those issues
 
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:29.660 align:start position:0%
tend to
 
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
parallel party division
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
I think that there we will disagree and
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
there will be 10 10 votes but I think
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly it will not be the case
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
and perhaps others don't agree with me
 
01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:46.259 align:start position:0%
but I think I I see my good colleague
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
from Ghost Town I think does agree with
 
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:51.299 align:start position:0%
me that that's likely to be the case
 
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
I hope I hope I hope you're right I do
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
we've we've Mr chair we've had a great
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
history of working together and kind of
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
amending bills or deciding not to amend
 
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:01.850 align:start position:0%
amending bills or deciding not to amend
bills

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and I I just would like to Echo uh my
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
friend representative Smith because we
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
have had some great experience in this
 
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
committee even though there have been
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
some pretty heavy subjects as well great
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:14.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
so the the last thing I would uh talk
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
about and then I'll open it up if
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
anybody else has anything they want to
 
01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.689 align:start position:0%
anybody else has anything they want to
say

01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
um it's just
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
um uh our demeanor at hearings um I
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned before you know it's it's not
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's generally not productive to try to
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
have a debate with a witness
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
um uh the other thing I would suggest is
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
it's really important I think that in in
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
the interest of making sure that
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
everyone feels you know that that
 
01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.950 align:start position:0%
everyone feels you know that that
they're

01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
um that they have an opportunity to be
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
heard that we
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
um you know know uh
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term no you know
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
rolling rolling your eyes or raising
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
eyebrows or that kind of thing I mean
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's just it just sends the wrong
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
message to people who are testifying if
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
you you may you may think that somebody
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
is completely all wet and you know out
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
out to lunch but uh
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know we we we can discuss that in an
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
executive session and you can have
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
you'll have every opportunity to to say
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
what you think but I think it's very
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
very important that people have a sense
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
that they've that they've been heard by
 
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
people who are interested in what they
 
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
have to say and you know our our fairly
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
evaluating what they have to say
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
um that's um
 
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative uh Turner
 
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you Mr chair a real real
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
specific question um do you have a
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
preferred way if we want to be
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
recognized as the conversations going
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
around to to ask for that
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
you know if you just if you just sort of
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
um you know you know the other thing I
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
would say is I know and this is when I
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
was on finance this got to be awkward to
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
some extent so
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
um my general preference would be but if
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
you know again I stand to be corrected
 
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
if somebody thinks this could be a
 
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.450 align:start position:0%
if somebody thinks this could be a
problem

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
if if you're if let's say you have a
 
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
question you raise your hand and I say
 
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative turd you know you have
 
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.810 align:start position:0%
representative turd you know you have
questions

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.490 align:start position:0%
questions
generally

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.050 align:start position:0%
generally
by

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
I I'm content to have you ask your
 
01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
question and ask a follow-up if you have
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
a follow-up without having to say can I
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up it's just seeing because
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
I know in finance that got to be very it
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
got to be very awkward of you know going
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
there was more conversation between the
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
chair and the uh and the member about
 
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
whether they could ask a follow-up then
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot simpler to just ask to
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
follow now if it gets you know if if it
 
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
if if one follow-up or two follow-up
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
starts to look like it's going to be 10
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
follow-ups I might interrupt and say
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
well wait a minute you know there are
 
01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
other people with their hands raised who
 
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
want to ask questions
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
um but generally uh you know I I would
 
01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:02.219 align:start position:0%
prefer to have members be able to ask
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
their questions and and and if if you
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
know if the answer
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
um if if the if the question isn't
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
answered to your satisfaction to be able
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
to ask a follow-up without having to say
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
can I can I ask a follow-up Mr chair
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense and if I could
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
also just point out
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
um you don't need to wave your hand if
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
you just kind of signal the clerk
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
the deputy the vice chair
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the ranking member will be generally
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
looking around and so we can then say to
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Paris has a
 
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
question and and he'll keep a list you
 
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
know in order of what people see and
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
then you just wait your turn and that
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
way it can all be done and give the
 
01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:56.060 align:start position:0%
illusion at least that we're very very
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
a well-oiled machine yes Mr here yes
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
it's a quick question do you have a
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
policy on um whether we can have like
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
laptops here or
 
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:09.890 align:start position:0%
laptops here or
um

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't I I don't have a problem
 
01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
um I guess the only thing I would say is
 
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's I think I think it's really
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
important that if you have a laptop if
 
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
you want to bring a laptop I don't have
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
a problem with that but what I think
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
would really be a bad look so to speak
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
from the public is if you're just
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know like this and and the you know
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't appear that you're paying
 
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
attention to the witness so if you want
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
to bring a laptop that's fine but
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
um you know when when the witness is
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
testifying I think we need we all need
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
to be paying attention to what the
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
witness is saying thank you
 
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.490 align:start position:0%
witness is saying thank you
yes

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:14:57.649 --> 01:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
I just want to mention that
 
01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
if there's a lot of Smiths people have a
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
tendency to make sure they have the
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
correct Smiths I there are only two
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
Perez's and I believe that
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
um you have a tendency to think that
 
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
well that there's only one Perez I have
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
received mail that has not been for me
 
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
but has been for Maria Perez so please I
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
ask you just remember I'm Christine with
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
a K Perez okay good point
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
so you know what uh representative
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
Horrigan you you raised a
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
you raised a question and I I want to uh
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
I wanna follow up on because I think it
 
01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:38.219 align:start position:0%
was it was uh an important one and I I'm
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
going to ask uh representative Smith for
 
01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
guidance on this I
 
01:15:42.659 --> 01:15:43.550 align:start position:0%
guidance on this I
um

01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that frequently it
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
will happen that a witness will come to
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
testify you know orally but we'll also
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
Present written testimony that uh my
 
01:15:59.209 --> 01:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
inclination unless somebody tells me we
 
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
shouldn't my inclination is that's
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine they can present their
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony that will become part
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
of the record and uh and and so I assume
 
01:16:07.679 --> 01:16:08.450 align:start position:0%
of the record and uh and and so I assume
that

01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
that you what you were asking about
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
before was not to suggest that there's
 
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
any limitation on that no not at all so
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's a very good practice
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
if they write out what they're going to
 
01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
have to say hopefully it won't be too
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
long but uh yeah but yeah sure well I
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
think in some sense that you know if
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
particularly if we're gonna if we're
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
going to be limiting testimony for oral
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
testimony to three minutes or whatever
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
it and somebody has more they want to
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
say they can say it in written testimony
 
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.930 align:start position:0%
say they can say it in written testimony
so

01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.270 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
anything else of course in my most
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
obstetris how do I say that
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
strappers I think
 
01:16:46.199 --> 01:16:47.270 align:start position:0%
strappers I think
um mood

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
um mood
 
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:51.860 align:start position:0%
um when people read word for word
 
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
testimony that they have written
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
my inclination when I'm feeling I'll
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
just say rude I don't have to use a word
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
I can't pronounce is to say all of us
 
01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
read and we will all read your testimony
 
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
why don't you tell us
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
what you think are the most important
 
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
points and that might not be very fair
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
because some people are very nervous
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
when they appear before us and they
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
can't they couldn't do it without
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
reading and
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and I don't like not to be fair but I
 
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
do get impatient when somebody has 10
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
pages that they're going to read to us
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
word for word right representative yes I
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
I agree with that there are some
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
instances members of the public it's
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
good for them to have their crib notes
 
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
if you will to keep them on subject
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
matter and on a good Tempo however again
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
a 10-page report from some subject
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
matter expert we can all digest that at
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
our own Leisure and not burn a
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
committee's Time unnecessarily
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
right yeah I've I've sort of with you
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I I think that you
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
know that uh when I was still in the
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
court and people would occasionally do
 
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.470 align:start position:0%
court and people would occasionally do
that

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
um uh particularly at like at oral
 
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
argument at the Supreme Court it really
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
it was not very effective and I think
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
all of us were would get uh would get
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
frustrated at that but I but I do
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
understand I think your point is well
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
taken some people are
 
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
um you know I've particularly if we had
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
Pro Se people in front of the court
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
um they are nervous and that it's
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes you just sort of tolerate that
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's uh but it's but it does it can be
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
sort of nerve-wracking I agree and we
 
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
will have people with obvious
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities and we can be sensitive to
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
that but we will have people whose
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
disabilities aren't obvious and we have
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
that we have to accommodate that it's
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
hard it's hard it's this is not easy
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
stuff and that's part of what I mean by
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
saying you've learned something new
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
every day and one of the things you
 
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.370 align:start position:0%
every day and one of the things you
learn

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
learn
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
um some of you might uh
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
some of you have been here before uh
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
would be familiar with the name Alabama
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
Sarah Al and I
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
will be very good friends nobody
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
can understand how the two of us could
 
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
be very good friends
 
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
but we were and you will all learn that
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
you can be very good friends with
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
someone where you don't agree with them
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
on any issue that's before us
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
but the decent people or they you know
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
they like Opera that you do or they like
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
high tea or and just keep that in mind
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
as you meet
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
members on your side of the aisle and
 
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
members on the other side yeah it's uh
 
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
they're 400 of us and we're not actually
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
a cross-section of the state we know
 
01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
that because there are many issues where
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
the public seems to feel one way but the
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislature feels another but just keep
 
01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
and you open up your eyes to the
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
differences about stuff and the
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
similarities does that sound like a
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
violent play it's not it's not yes
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative and I like to add to that
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
we've all got to learn how to get along
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
I don't care if we're on one side of the
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
aisle or the other I worked for this guy
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
he was on one side of the aisle and I
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
was on the other we never agreed but
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
what we did we never talked politics but
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
we had a great friendship there's so
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
many things he liked that I liked and
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
vice versa and I think we get to
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes stop looking at things that as
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
the person and not what they believe in
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you well I I would Echo your your
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
view I and I to sort of personalize this
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh the love of my life my wife uh
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
um is a committed Democrat we uh we we
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
often uh we often uh I we are we often
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
say to each other that we when we go to
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
the polls we cancel each other out
 
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:25.070 align:start position:0%
the polls we cancel each other out
because

01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I think if uh if we can do that in a
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
marriage of oh 27 years uh I I think we
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
can do it here yes that's an observation
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
um you know last session
 
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:38.750 align:start position:0%
um you know last session
um

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
I found it very very awkward that when
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
folks were coming to testify they would
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know before speaking they would go
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
through all through the room to all of
 
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
us to pass out their testimony and it it
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
could have kind of wasted time so I
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
think that we should look at more
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
efficient ways to get that
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
um paper out paper to the machine back
 
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
on the end and pass it around yeah yeah
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
that's true but some of them some of
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
them will just walk right by people
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
nope okay no I I think that I think that
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.590 align:start position:0%
makes sense
other

01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:22:18.649 --> 01:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask so
 
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
um when we're going to be meeting on
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays and Thursdays
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so during the when the house usually
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
meets on a Thursday would we also meet
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
on another day of that week probably not
 
01:22:36.169 --> 01:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
probably not so that was that you know
 
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm gonna
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned about making sure that
 
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
we get our work done obviously so I mean
 
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
there may that may mean that they're
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
particularly as we have as as we get
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
closer to deadlines that may mean that
 
01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to have some long days
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
um but um you know that's kind of
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way it is yes uh uh
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lack of microphone
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
etiquette you know people uh they either
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
sit back like this or talk like this you
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
know uh I I assume that the the this is
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
being recorded
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
or the hearings will be recorded
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
I would ask that people speak into the
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
microphone so that when people are
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
watching it at home or we're reviewing
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
it so that we can hear what they're
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
saying you know and because like I said
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
I've I've seen several people here that
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're talking like this or uh that's
 
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point and I will try
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
to remember you know particularly with
 
01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
at all I'd ask everyone here to make
 
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
sure you're talking to the microphone
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
but particularly with Witnesses I will
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
because you're right and we want to we
 
01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
wanna this is being recorded and we want
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're not that
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're being heard on the recording as
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
opposed to just you know sort of white
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
noise yeah yeah I'm sorry the other
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
thing is I believe if more than three of
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
the microphones are on that kind of
 
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
disables them
 
01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
so when you're done speaking oh good
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
good point yeah okay good point
 
01:24:15.169 --> 01:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
um with the microphones
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
um some people are even trying to listen
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
on YouTube while they're driving in
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
their car it says
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
so I did uh
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I know I forgot which
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee it was I was listening to and
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
actually they did a pretty good job with
 
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
the microphones but uh the worse
 
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
offender ironically was the rules
 
01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
committee which is all the senior
 
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
leadership of the house and uh
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
well my own caucuses leader
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm was pretty
 
01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
audible uh representative Simpson his
 
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
Deputy was very audible but like some of
 
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
the other people like they're just sort
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
of this murmur and I almost like drove
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
off the road trying to figure it trying
 
01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
to get trying to like car radio loud
 
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:55.340 align:start position:0%
enough to hear them so like uh
 
01:24:57.649 --> 01:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
well it's okay to listen just don't
 
01:24:59.450 --> 01:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
watch the video which is pretty boring
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
anyway so um
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
actually and and also when I originally
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
raised my hand too on isn't Thursday
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
Thursday is also like a reporting
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
deadline every week to be in the next
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
week's uh session so although sometimes
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
we exact things and then don't vote on
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
on the full house until like
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know two or three weeks later it was
 
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.090 align:start position:0%
you know two or three weeks later it was
yeah

01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.169 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:21.179 --> 01:25:24.229 align:start position:0%
yeah
thanks

01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
um anything else anything else yes
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Staples yeah especially
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
during votes in executive sessions
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
um I've seen in the past from Zoom
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
review that some people didn't have
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
their microphones on
 
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
and so you're trying to figure out how
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to work in the final count
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
so if everybody's up close to the mic
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
and has the mic on for the votes that
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
helps the public understand what's going
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
on the other item I wanted to mention is
 
01:25:57.169 --> 01:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
other committees
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
I've seen where a testimony will begin
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
and they'll split
 
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
the written testimony in half one on
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
this table one on the other table and
 
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
then we just pass them all up seems to
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
be a pretty efficient way instead of a
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
lot of moving around or one table only
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
all around yeah I think that makes sense
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense I agree thank
 
01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:19.610 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense I agree thank
you

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
all right right
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
yes I thought it was interesting that uh
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh likes to have
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
is because I keep my bills
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
in a binder that keeps them
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
in order I put them in an order and then
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
I put all the testimony behind
 
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
and some people like to have an
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
individual file for each bill
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
works for them if they're neater than I
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
am but for me I need them all
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
too so that's why I have I brought the
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
binder because I knew that the chair
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
would have bills for us today it did and
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
now I can put it see now I like page
 
01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.350 align:start position:0%
now I can put it see now I like page
numbers

01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh getting getting testimony or
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
documentation that doesn't have page
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
you and I were in charge it would be
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
all right um so you so just so that um
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
everyone knows I as I said I I scheduled
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
I believe about eight bills for hearing
 
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
for next Wednesday I'm gonna add to that
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
so we're probably gonna be here for a
 
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
full day on Wednesday and I'm also going
 
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
to schedule bills for uh for the
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
following day
 
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:01.460 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
my my plan would be if there if of the
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
bills we've got if there are enough
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
bills to fill up the two days of work
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
without without addressing the three
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
where the three areas where we have a
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
lot of bills that is abortion landlord
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
tenant and right to know I will probably
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
not schedule those bills in that first
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
two day period two-day period but if you
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
know if we can't if we don't have enough
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
bills then I may schedule but again I
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
will try to I will try to if I'm gonna
 
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
do uh in one of those areas I'll try to
 
01:28:39.729 --> 01:28:39.739 align:start position:0%
do all the bills we have in that area
 
01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
you have to get that in by noon today I
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
think I do have to get it in yeah yeah
 
01:28:43.739 --> 01:28:45.229 align:start position:0%
think I do have to get it in yeah yeah
so

01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:45.239 --> 01:28:46.490 align:start position:0%
so
yes

01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
I just want to say I appreciate that
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
from a new person perspective let us get
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
our feet wet before we get really hit
 
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
hard right no exactly I think that I
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
think that makes sense for all of us
 
01:28:59.810 --> 01:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
really to um to try to get those bills
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
out of the way first all right great um
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
all right well thanks thanks so much for
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
