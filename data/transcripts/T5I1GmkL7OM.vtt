00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
bring it down to three minutes and then
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
if it's repetitious we don't want to
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
hear it if you have anything new to add
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean so that way there
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're not being the same thing over and
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
over and over
 
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.390 align:start position:0%
over and over
okay

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
before we get started any questions or
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
anything uh
 
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.629 align:start position:0%
anything uh
okay

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh if phyllis katzesaurus comes i'm
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
hoping she's gonna be here
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that uh ben berube who's
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
a long time friend of mine
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
and it killed me to tell him that i'm
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
not going to reschedule his bill
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
because it's a resolution and i don't
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
think i should bring you all in just for
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
one bill
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know i mean so what we'll do is
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
we'll have somebody if if phyllis isn't
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
here we'll have somebody introduce the
 
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.550 align:start position:0%
here we'll have somebody introduce the
bill

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know and if you have somebody on
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
your side that wants to introduce it we
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay we'll adjust from there but to
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
bring everybody in for that one
 
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
bring everybody in for that one
resolution

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's just and it's too late for me to
 
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
put it on the schedule for tomorrow
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
i have to think about this i might be
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
able to recess it i don't know
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
relative to the to transparency of
 
00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.990 align:start position:0%
relative to the to transparency of
federal

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
agency operations within new hampshire
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
in speaking with voters in my district
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
many had questions about the authority
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
and level of activity of our federal
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
agencies in our state
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
upon investigating this
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
i made several interesting discoveries
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
some of which i was unaware of
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
these investigations led to the
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
i personally was surprised to find out
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
that there are currently 73 federal
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
agencies employing full-time law
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
in the united states and these
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
officers are authorized by law to
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
perform four specific functions
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
conduct criminal criminal investigations
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
execute search warrants including no
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
knock warrants make arrests
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
and carry firearms
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
when i began to look into these agencies
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
to which of these agencies were
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
operating in new hampshire and to what
 
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.790 align:start position:0%
operating in new hampshire and to what
extent

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
extent
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
they were performing these functions i
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
was surprised again at what i found
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
agencies of the federal government are
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
under no obligation to provide any
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
transparency of their past present or
 
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.390 align:start position:0%
transparency of their past present or
future

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
presence or activities to citizens of
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
any state
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
while the most while most active
 
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
while the most while most active
agencies

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
in a state in the spirit of cooperation
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
develop relationships
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
and share to some degree this
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
information with the state
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
and even local law enforcement officials
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
it is voluntary
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
and only to the level they wish to
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
this lack of transparency leads to a
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
lack of knowledge and understanding in
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
regards to the president activities
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
the presence and activities of the
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
federal government agencies in our state
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
this in turn leads to fear speculation
 
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.829 align:start position:0%
this in turn leads to fear speculation
and

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding fb
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
1411 seeks to improve this transparency
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
in a safe and voluntary way
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
it has the ag's office request
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
non-identifying and historic data
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
relating to the presence and level of
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
activities of these agencies during the
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
previous month or year
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
this data is then compiled and put into
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
a single location on the state doj
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
public website
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
i believe by increasing transparency and
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
public awareness
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
in an easy to access location we have an
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reduce speculation and
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
misinformation and improve the pro the
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
public's trust
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
i hope that these agencies will see this
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity to improve and define
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
their public image and improve the state
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
and federal relations
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
agents from ice
 
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
agents from ice
can

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes come on the campus and request
 
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
sometimes come on the campus and request
or

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
really demand off sometimes with a
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
warrant sometimes not
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
to get information on international
 
00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
to get information on international
students

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.670 align:start position:0%
students
um

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
uh you know they'll walk into say the
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
admissions office or the registrar's
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
office and with ice jackets on saying we
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
want information on these students
 
00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:34.069 align:start position:0%
want information on these students
um

00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
and you have a secretary or
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
there it's it's very intimidating i uh
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to develop some
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
protocols because
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
there should be a warrant and there
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
should be a specific type of warrant in
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
order to get that information sometimes
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
there is sometimes there isn't you have
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
a person sitting at a front desk
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
is this the type of thing would your
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
bill then
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
help alert us
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
that ice agents are on the ground trying
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
to collect information
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that we should be prepared to ask
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
certain questions or refer them to
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
in reality no because
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh what this will do
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
is it will
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
allow you to look and see to what level
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
they have done it
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
the questions that that are asked and
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
that are written in this bill
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
generally refer to what they did in the
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
previous month
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
um and and this is in regards to
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
operational security for federal
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
agencies it would be very difficult for
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
a state to say hey we would like to know
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
what you're going to be doing because
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
that affects their ability to operate
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
and and we don't have the authority to
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
do that they have the authority to
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
operate in the state
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
what this does is it
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
provides transparency in what in who's
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
it about who is in the state and what
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
they have been doing so that we can look
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
and see the levels of of activity within
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
the state over a year period um right
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
now that data is collected across
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
you can get the data some of it if you
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
the websites of those agencies and and
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
see hey are you operating in our state a
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
lot of times you would actually have to
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
write letters to them and as uh
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
civilians you may or may not get an
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
answer because they're under no
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to tell you
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
this is the ag asking them to
 
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.230 align:start position:0%
this is the ag asking them to
voluntarily

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
give us some of this data that is not
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous to their operational security
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can have a running tally of
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
what what they're actually doing so it's
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
just a matter of increasing transparency
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
in public awareness
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
and giving us something that we can look
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
at and say this is what's been happening
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
in our state and we can we can take
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
different actions we could possibly um
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
talk to the federal congressional
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh delegation and see if they could you
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
know if we had concerns and see if they
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
could address those at the federal level
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's very little we can do at the
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
state level
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
in your bill you include the total
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
number of federal foreign refugee
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
relocations in new hampshire year to
 
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.949 align:start position:0%
relocations in new hampshire year to
date

00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
updated monthly the first question i
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
have is why did you include that
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
um it's just a data point to see because
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
when when they are
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
when they are bringing refugees into the
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
state there is different federal
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
activities the transportation a bunch of
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
different activities and all this is
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
doing is keeping track of the level of
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
that activity um
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
and and so that was included in there
 
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
and and so that was included in there
it's

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
um it actually is is public knowledge if
 
00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:01.509 align:start position:0%
um it actually is is public knowledge if
you

00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
can hit the right websites and the right
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
agencies that are doing it this just
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
allows someone
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
to look at that and see it
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
in one spot that's awesome
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you mr
 
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you mr
chair

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
so do you expect the locations to change
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
monthly is that why you're having it
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
updated monthly
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
the locations yeah because you said no
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
that will probably end up being static
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
data within the database
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
but if they if they um
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
add locations or add um
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
facilities then that would be recorded
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
the additions more than anything else or
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
the subtractions if they leave
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative moffitt you had a
 
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative moffitt you had a
question

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you representative
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and uh so i
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
noticed the way this is worded it
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
asks that the federal agencies
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
voluntarily verify an update if they
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't do that there's i don't see any
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement or mechanism
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have the authority well thank
 
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
we don't have the authority well thank
you

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we don't have
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
the authority to
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
do any kind of enforcement on the
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
federal agencies what we can do is we
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
can ask them for the information if they
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
don't provide the information we can say
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
they chose not to provide the
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
information if they do that over a long
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
enough period of time
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the question may come up as to why
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
they're not providing information
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have any of that so
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
this gives us just a little bit it gives
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
us as much as i could
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
but like i said we are very limited as
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
to what we can do at a state level
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh understood thank you and a follow-up
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
so if an fbi if the fbi is conducting a
 
00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:46.150 align:start position:0%
so if an fbi if the fbi is conducting a
uh

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
some um
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
investigation of uh say
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
border violations or
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
whatever they would be doing here
 
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.749 align:start position:0%
whatever they would be doing here
uh

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
would i suspect they would have concerns
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
about opsec operational security and and
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
would be very reticent to share
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
who's here doing what is it is that a
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
fair concern that that
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
that they would have
 
00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:13.749 align:start position:0%
that they would have
about

00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
this measure well as far as a fair
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
concern over operational security yeah i
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
with with my uh
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
with with the units that i served with
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
in the air force and
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
i understand operational security
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
very well and how a little teeny bit of
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
information can actually damage the
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
ability of an agency or organization to
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
get their job done
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
so when i did this um
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
if you look in the wording it basically
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
is trying to say things that they've
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
completed not ongoing investigations
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's not i'm not trying to target
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
anything they are doing because in doing
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
that it would
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
compromise their investigation so if
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
this is just a matter of
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
what have you completed
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
because i don't see any any uh
 
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.630 align:start position:0%
because i don't see any any uh
any

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
danger to their operational security by
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
asking them what they've completed
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
okay before i go to representative
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things we talked about
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
earlier was the date
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh there will be an amendment on this
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
here to change the date from july to
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
probably january i believe 2023 uh
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
is that what your plan was uh thank you
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i my plan was to just do
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
something like a 60 days after uh
 
00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
something like a 60 days after uh
passage

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
passage
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
my recommendations here would be to do
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
something like a january or 2023. okay i
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
could do that give them an ample enough
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
time because you don't know
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
what type of software is this a mandate
 
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.270 align:start position:0%
what type of software is this a mandate
or

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know do they have to bring up a new
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
website for this here or what design
 
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.350 align:start position:0%
website for this here or what design
something

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
and there's nobody here from federal
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
government you know to come in to
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
testify on this so something to keep in
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
mind that's why we try to put it out to
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
give them the opportunity
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
uh representative for taking my question
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
i just had one question um are federal
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
agencies so when the attorney general of
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire solicits and
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
they you know request this information
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
to be published on the website are the
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
federal agencies required is it like an
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
all or nothing are they required to give
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
all this information or if they choose
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
not to give all of it then they can't
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
give it all or could they just pick and
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
choose you know which information that
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
they do give well they actually could
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
pick and choose it's nine data points if
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh they give you the data point you
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
write down what data they gave you and
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
if they don't then you write down that
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
they didn't you know that they didn't uh
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
provide you with any data could i have a
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman thank you mr
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
chairman uh just just another question
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
then because you know this is the point
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
that i'm trying to lead to is so so so
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
federal agencies will have a certain
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
amount of discretion over what
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
information if they choose to provide
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
what information they give so then it
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
protects their agency's ability to
 
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.110 align:start position:0%
protects their agency's ability to
operate

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
and it can protect the public interest
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
of them being able to operate on behalf
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
of the public or to provide as much
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
information as they like so they can
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
have as much transparency and you know
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
also uh fulfill that duty to the public
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
too correct oh absolutely yes thank you
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
for the question they they they would be
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
able to um withhold information that
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
they felt was uh you know a threat to
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
their their operational security
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
but could provide information
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
that that would let people know what
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing because sometimes what
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
they're often what they're doing in our
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
state is very good things and
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
even that would be a positive awareness
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
so this would allow us to to hopefully
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
um improve the uh the federal and state
 
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.150 align:start position:0%
um improve the uh the federal and state
relations

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i mean i i like
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
to build but i'm not sure whether we can
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
hold um the federal government you know
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
i mean in this here because i wish there
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
was somebody that came in the testify on
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
so even if we moved it over the senate
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully somebody from this you know
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
that will testify in the senate if they
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
see that we're serious
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
and want information there now represent
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
you had a great question there about at
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
the colleges there and i know there was
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
an issue somewhere out in california or
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
argonne where they were doing the same
 
00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:19.430 align:start position:0%
argonne where they were doing the same
thing

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
but it came out that
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
the elected officials were telling
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
people to leave
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
knowing they broke the law
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
before the knowing that they were coming
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
in it's illegal
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know to really do that um so it's
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's why i
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
i relate what you said there but i
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
believe this happened in other states
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%

uh do i need a second mr chair um do we
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative massimilia
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
actually a second by uh mason is not
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
required but i always oh okay i didn't i
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't realize that but i'm
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
saying i always do a second but you're
 
01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:29.110 align:start position:0%
saying i always do a second but you're
right

01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
but go ahead you can speak to your
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
motion yeah of course um so the the
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us today to uh
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
it would essentially amend the bill to
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh to exactly replicate uh 2007's senate
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
bill 221.
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
that was a suggestion by representative
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
wall who actually introduced that uh
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
legislation back in 2007
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to organize
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
events in celebration of the abraham
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
lincoln bicentennial so um some of the
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
some of the basic changes is the makeup
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the commission
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
i decided to make it so then there would
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
be one person from the senate appointed
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
by the senate president one from the
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
minority one from the majority caucus um
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
from the house appointed by the speaker
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
one from the majority one from the
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
minority office um
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
we we left in the native american
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
affairs chair of their designee and we
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
then added the state veterans council um
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
as established and rsa 110-b colon 89 or
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
their designee that was in you know an
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
agreement that was came up with with the
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
majority caucus and the minority caucus
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
of the committee we also um changed
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
instead of having it so the board of
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
trustees of the college system and the
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
community college system we changed it
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
so then it would be the chancellor of
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
the university system or the community
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
college system because that's what it
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
had in uh and the formerly uh lincoln
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
the abraham lincoln bicentennial
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
commission right so then instead of
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
having the board of trustees meet and
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
have to appoint someone having the
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
chancellor has already been appointed to
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know basically run these
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
institutions have them or a designee do
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
it would make more sense and you know
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
saves everyone time
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the change of the the
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
makeup and it would be 15 people on the
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee we also changed a little bit
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
of what the duties were i made them a
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more precise and more in line
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
with what historically has been done
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
with commissions like this
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
for example like the abraham lincoln
 
01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
for example like the abraham lincoln
bicentennial

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
bicentennial
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
one thing that we added that isn't in
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 221 that's going to be in
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation is making sure that
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's a publicly noticized and
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
publicized event for july 4th 2026. um
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a requirement in the abraham
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
lincoln bicentennial i think it's
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
important for requirement in this that
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
we have a specific day of when a
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
celebration will take place and when uh
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
in that the public is notified and told
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
about it and then one last thing that
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
some people had asked about that even
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
olas had asked about and i had to
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
explain to them based on what uh
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative wall explained to me is
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
the uh the trust fund that was
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
established this wasn't done in the
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
previous bill this was done though in
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
the abraham lincoln bicentennial uh
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is so then there can be
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of funds if the finance
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
committee chooses in future budget uh
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know future budgets to put some
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
money aside or so the state can solicit
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
donations the commission can solicit
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
donations from organizations you know
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
within the state and across the country
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
or accept federal funds if federal funds
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
ever become available for helping states
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
the fund would be run by the by the
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
treasurer of the state and um it would
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh it would lapse into the general fund
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
any extra dollars in 2027 and um one
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
last thing to just clarify too is that
 
01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:29.590 align:start position:0%
last thing to just clarify too is that
um

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
i believe we have the uh the
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
organization um and this is the same
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
this was one question i couldn't find
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
answered by representative wall
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
which is they meet this commission even
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
after the celebration that was something
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
the abraham lincoln bicentennial did too
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
why they did that i'm not sure i
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't get a hold of anyone who was on
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
that um on that committee i actually
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
think senator hassan might have been
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
involved so and when she was a state
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
senator then to give it some perspective
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
right so um
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
that might be for creating a final
 
01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
that might be for creating a final
report

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm not entirely sure but i know that
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
it could also just be because they said
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
well what if we couldn't have it on that
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
date and we need to reschedule for a
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
date in the future um i don't know but i
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
copied the exact how the lincoln abraham
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
lincoln bicentennial
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
how they established their commission it
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
worked it was successful they had a good
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
program i think you know we shouldn't
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel this amendment just
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
mocks that
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
are there anyone else that want to speak
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
to the uh
 
01:12:30.719 --> 01:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
to the uh
representative

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
yeah no i think uh i think that probably
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
that final date to your point is
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
probably to debrief and probably come
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
out with the final report and like look
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
at oh how did this work out
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if they if the lincoln
 
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.070 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if they if the lincoln
um

01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh memorial team like if they came out
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
with a report after um might be good to
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
guess maybe either our researcher to
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
look into but
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
um no i think this is a great amendment
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
i think let's not reinvent the wheel i
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
think this is this is the right way to
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
do this so
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%

there was the emails that went around to
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
the whole committee this here was as
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan as nonpartisan gets
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing is it got a little bit
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
out of control because it went to the
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
whole committee which goes against the
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
91a because there's a quorum working on
 
01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.590 align:start position:0%
91a because there's a quorum working on
legislation

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%

cover if anyone wanted to see those
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
you know they think it's right of a grey
 
01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:51.910 align:start position:0%
you know they think it's right of a grey
area

01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
oh wait a second right here right here
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
14 11
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
14 11.
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay that goes for my own file
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
one second i'm sending something to our
 
01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:39.189 align:start position:0%
one second i'm sending something to our
assistant

01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
has your amendment come back down from
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna get ready to start yeah
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
you had something quick
 
01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:16.229 align:start position:0%
you had something quick
yeah

01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
does a senator so how does it work when
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's a concurrent resolution because i
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
know the senate has rules for what they
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
permit what they don't permit to come
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
because i know they usually don't take
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
these unless they're probably to take
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
this because the gop wants it yeah oh
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to okay
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's what that okay that's that
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
clarification too yeah
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
no just don't ask yeah
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
i won't be asking yeah that's why i
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
asked you
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:46.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open up the hearing on hcr
 
01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.430 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open up the hearing on hcr
7

01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
7
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
which is reaffirming support for the
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
nation of israel in the location of the
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
embassy of the united states
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
therein and the prime sponsor
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine welcome to the
 
01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:09.750 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine welcome to the
committee

01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to uh
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
present to you hcr 7. uh it's already
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
been read by the chair
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is a simple resolution but i think
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's an important and powerful statement
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
because at this time we have generations
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
who are forgetting history we have
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
institutions that are trying to rewrite
 
01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:26.470 align:start position:0%
institutions that are trying to rewrite
history

01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
we have nations and people who are more
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
and more attacking the simple existence
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
of one of our most steadfast allies in a
 
01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:32.790 align:start position:0%
of one of our most steadfast allies in a
region

01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
region
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
of great upheaval
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
and as we recently saw in texas
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
terrorists are becoming more brazen
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire should stand firm with
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
israel and tell the world that we
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
remember and we support our democratic
 
01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.229 align:start position:0%
remember and we support our democratic
ally

01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
ally
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have
 
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you take questions from
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
the committee i will thank you any
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
questions for representatives colleen
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative miller
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm just curious what precipitated
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
this bill as i mentioned we've got more
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
and more
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
statements from countries throughout the
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
the world and actions taking place
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
within our own borders that
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
are disturbing and
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
we have recently located the embassy uh
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
into jerusalem where it belongs and uh
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
there are many many people trying now to
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
fight to not only tear down israel
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
itself but to
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
remove the capital and remove the
 
01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
remove the capital and remove the
embassy

01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
embassy
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:35.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh my question and thank you chairman
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
for letting me ask a question uh why
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
in this house resolution or house
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution
 
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:44.790 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution
uh

01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
why does it make the specification that
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
we are supporting the uh change in the
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
embassy's location
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
because it is now located where we had
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
for generations promised it would be
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
moved and uh although
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
four or five uh different presidents
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
came and go without it moving we finally
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
have it in the right place and it should
 
01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:08.709 align:start position:0%
have it in the right place and it should
remain

01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
we fulfilled a promise that was made
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
long ago yes okay representative cat
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
service you have a question
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
no oh representative
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative spelaine for bringing
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
forward this important concurrent
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
resolution um i my question is um is it
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
is it true that it was uh president uh
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
bill clinton who originally had the had
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the law passed at the embassy
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
would be moved from tel aviv to
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
jerusalem and that has just been
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
congress constantly suspending that
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
change until finally the president
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
united states president trump allowed it
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
to be moved to jerusalem
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
that would be my understanding
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up uh do you
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
think that this house concurrent
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
resolution uh is
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh unjustly picking a sign in a tooth uh
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
in a conflict between the israelis and
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
palestinians and do you think that it
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
could interfere with the peace process
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions around
 
01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.750 align:start position:0%
any other questions around
representative

01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
did the obama administration also
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
support the move from tel aviv to
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative a couple here um
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
i i believe um president obama also
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
in his speech and when he first ran was
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
in support
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
because as a matter of fact my
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and many presidents that
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
did support this here
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
and president trump was the first one to
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know finally do it make it happen do
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
you agree
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
yes okay my other question is on uh
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
concerns over why now
 
01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:56.870 align:start position:0%
concerns over why now
um

01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
why did you put this in now versus
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
because we've seen the attacks and the
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh drum beat around the world and
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
especially at the u.n to try to um
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
subvert and and um
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
make israel uh
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
not no longer a nation of its own
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um are there any other
 
01:51:19.119 --> 01:51:20.709 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um are there any other
questions

01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%

on the topic and watching documentaries
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%

holocaust
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
after the war among those who survived
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
many immigrated to the holy land
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
israel has been our strongest ally in
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
the middle east
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you've heard of brigitte
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
gabriel but she was born in lebanon and
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
had to live in an underground bunker for
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
seven years during the civil war and
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
destroyed the peace in that country
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
it was in the nation of israel that
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
interceded to rescue her and then helped
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
to get her to the united states today
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
she is an american activist for freedom
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
and liberty and obviously supports
 
01:53:00.239 --> 01:53:01.669 align:start position:0%
and liberty and obviously supports
israel

01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
israel
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
on a personal note i have always had
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
great respect for judaism i learned a
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
lot about the faith from the guff which
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
is said to be the repository for all the
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
unborn souls to the mezuzah
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
the latter is a decorative case that
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
contains specific hebrew verses from the
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
torah it looks like a scroll and you'll
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
find it on the doorposts of jewish homes
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
before entering the home you touch the
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
mezuzah and then kiss your fingertips
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
and that is what i do out of respect
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
when i visit a jewish home
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
when i went to a synagogue i had a
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
profound sense that i was in a holy
 
01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:34.149 align:start position:0%
profound sense that i was in a holy
place

01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
i can't describe it but i've met others
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
who have said the same
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
so when i first visited the orthodox
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
church that i've been attending for the
 
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
last 20 years i remember thinking wow
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's almost jewish here except they're
 
01:53:45.599 --> 01:53:47.109 align:start position:0%
it's almost jewish here except they're
christians

01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
christians
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
so knowing how much i revere the ancient
 
01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:50.709 align:start position:0%
so knowing how much i revere the ancient
faith

01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
faith
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
explains why i asked to co-sponsor hcr
 
01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:54.470 align:start position:0%
explains why i asked to co-sponsor hcr
hcr7

legislator four terms ago i also
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
remember asking him where he got it
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
because i wanted to get one too but i
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it this morning i would
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%

01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
now i too support israel and i believe
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
that having the u.s embassy in israel is
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
prudent and just and it needs to stay
 
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:17.270 align:start position:0%

there
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
lastly a resolution may not be a bill
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
that has sharp teeth but it's the
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%

01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
significance there which israel
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
recognizes and protects fiercely
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
israel's government regards jerusalem as
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
the eternal and indivisible capital of
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
the country and the united states
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
recognized that important historical
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
political and religious claim
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
so do 32 other countries in the world
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that we must as a legislative
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
body make a bold statement in support
 
01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.229 align:start position:0%
body make a bold statement in support
and

01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
solidarity of the jewish people and
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
their homeland israel
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
as well as the decision by our
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
government to move the u.s embassy to
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
watching the hostage situation unfold at
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
congregation beth israel in coleyville
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
texas last week was another reminder of
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate rise in anti-semitism
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
throughout our country and the world it
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
reminds us all that we must take a stand
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
against anti-semitism and discrimination
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
of all kinds
 
01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:14.470 align:start position:0%
of all kinds
indeed

01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
we have even had a bipartisan statement
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
broadcast taking a stance against
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism on december second twenty
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
twenty one
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
by our speaker of the house and minority
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
leadership so this bill seems a natural
 
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that letter to house
 
01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:33.189 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that letter to house
members

01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
my husband has family that live in
 
01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.709 align:start position:0%
my husband has family that live in
israel

01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
israel
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
members of his family immigrated to
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
when it was the only place jews could go
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
both of us personally have many family
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
members who perished in hitler's
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
concentration camps
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
we as descendants are considered
 
01:59:01.599 --> 01:59:03.430 align:start position:0%
we as descendants are considered
survivors

01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
survivors
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
and thank god our relatives survived
 
01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
those awful times
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
and were either able to come to america
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
but still my husband and i have seen the
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
we grew up with it and unfortunately it
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
still lingers even since hitler's defeat
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we've heard the ugly words of people
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to push the house of israel
 
01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
into the sea
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
instead of working towards peaceful
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
peaceful resolutions to this kind of
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
awful division in hatred
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to see
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire house take a leading
 
01:59:52.159 --> 01:59:53.109 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire house take a leading
role

01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
role
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
to a firm support of the jewish state of
 
01:59:55.199 --> 01:59:56.629 align:start position:0%
to a firm support of the jewish state of
israel

resolution the same but add
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%

and i think that one thing that has been
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of months ago
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
a member of the general court
 
02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:08.149 align:start position:0%
a member of the general court
actually

02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:02:08.159 --> 02:02:10.629 align:start position:0%
actually
publicly

02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
02:02:10.639 --> 02:02:12.390 align:start position:0%
publicly
espoused

02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
espoused
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
the motto
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the terrorist group hamas
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
from the river to the sea palestine will
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
be free
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
and when you examine that statement from
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
that terrorist group designated
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
terrorist group
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
it means to wipe out the state of israel
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
and kill all the jews by pushing them
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
into the mediterranean sea
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's what it means
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the subtext of that
 
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:41.669 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the subtext of that
statement

02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
and we need
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
by passing this
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%

to happen under republican democrats

02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
relationship between america and israel
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely and it's our only true ally
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
through thick and thin in the mideast
 
02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:29.830 align:start position:0%
through thick and thin in the mideast
yes

02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%

anyone else out there that wants to
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
speak that did not sign up
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see any with that i am going to
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on house concurrent

02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say that again one sec
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't look at me
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.519 --> 02:16:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
once again i'm going to open up the
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on hr 17 house resolution
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
opposing our federal in state efforts to
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
establish a carbon tax on fuels for
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
electricity and transportation i'm going
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
to welcome representative bernardi to
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
the committee and the floridas
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman and
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
jd bernardi i'm representative from
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
rockingham 16 which is southampton east
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
kingston and kensington
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
so why would anyone want to propose a
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
carbon tax on fuels and transportation
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
and for transportation and electricity
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
nominally because burning carbon dioxide
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
based fuels releases carbon dioxide into
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
and what's wrong with releasing carbon
 
02:17:30.559 --> 02:17:31.830 align:start position:0%
and what's wrong with releasing carbon
dioxide

02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
dioxide
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
the gas that we exhale when we breathe
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
about two pounds a day into the
 
02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:38.629 align:start position:0%
about two pounds a day into the
atmosphere

02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
well the environmental crusaders say it
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
will cause global warming and manifold
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
attendant consequences
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
adverse weather sea level rises
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
this was predicted by computer models
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
that were first reported by the u.n
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
environmental director
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
in 1972
 
02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
but then it was global cooling because
 
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
of all the other pollutants
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
that are part of combustion
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
since 1982
 
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
89 90 2007
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
1518 and last year
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
the world is just another
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
10 years from a global
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
warming catastrophe
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
additionally the computer models focus
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
only on man-made sources of carbon
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
dioxide and completely ignore
 
02:18:32.479 --> 02:18:34.110 align:start position:0%
dioxide and completely ignore
significant

02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable contributions like
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
volcanic eruptions
 
02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:41.750 align:start position:0%
volcanic eruptions
importantly

02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
none of the crusaders models
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
correspond to the actual observed
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
climate on earth
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
global temperature change has been about
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
a half a degree in the last 50 years
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
the most disastrous models
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
model scenarios have pushed pushed by
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
the crusaders
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
and a complicit media and big tech say
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
that these levels will be a three and a
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
half to four and a half degrees
 
02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%
disasters sell
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
and support the need
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
for big government solutions and support
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
the need for more government grants
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
to study the quote-unquote problem
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
mankind has easily adapted to this
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
modest half-degree temperature change we
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
lived through warmer periods in the past
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
the highest recent temperatures
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
occurred during the dust bowl areas of
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
the 1930s
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
previous warm periods occurred in the
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
middle ages when they grew barley
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
in greenland so the vikings could
 
02:19:51.359 --> 02:19:53.030 align:start position:0%
in greenland so the vikings could
survive

02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
survive
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
during the roman era they grew grapes in
 
02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
england for wine
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
the sun's warmth and carbon dioxide
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
allow plants to photosynthesize to grow
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
and produce more abundant grasses trees
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
and crop yields
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
not remotely an emergency
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's been a positive
 
02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:15.630 align:start position:0%
it's been a positive
thing

02:20:15.630 --> 02:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
agriculturally for this planet
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
le chateau's principle tells us that
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
when a settled system is disturbed
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
disturbed it will adjust to diminish the
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
change that has been made to it
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
despite the modest carbon dioxide
 
02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:33.110 align:start position:0%
despite the modest carbon dioxide
increase

02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
storms floods droughts have reduced
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
from 1980 to 2016.
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
yet this doesn't stop
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
demagoguing these events
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
that have always occurred and will
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
there is no climate emergency and we
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
should not be stampeded into adopting a
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
climate crusader's prescription for
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
raising carbon taxes to lessen the use
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
of these fuels for transportation and
 
02:21:06.479 --> 02:21:08.309 align:start position:0%
of these fuels for transportation and
electricity

02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:21:08.319 --> 02:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
electricity
unfortunately

02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
since the time that i drafted this bill
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
the biden administration has effectively
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
added an overwhelming carbon tax by
 
02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:19.790 align:start position:0%
added an overwhelming carbon tax by
various

02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
various
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
anti-energy initiatives
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
natural gas production and distribution
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
has been discouraged
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
the keystone xl pipeline was cancelled
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
immediately at the start of the
 
02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.630 align:start position:0%
immediately at the start of the
administration

02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
dominion and duke energy canceled the
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
atlantic pipeline due to quote
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
legal uncertainties
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
caused by progressive pipeline opponents
 
02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
the panic pipeline was cancelled for
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
similar reasons
 
02:21:52.870 --> 02:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
all new drilling was prohibited on
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
federal lands so existing wells so as
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
existing wells are closed supplies
 
02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
become more limited and prices go up
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
note about 56 percent of the electricity
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
generated in new england is from natural
 
02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.150 align:start position:0%
generated in new england is from natural
gas

02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
gas
 
02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
gas
supplier

02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
supplier
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
portions of our electric bills have more
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
than doubled
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire pays the fifth highest
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
electric rates in the continental u.s
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
and they're skyrocketing
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
natural gas prices for home heating are
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
jumping over 50 percent as well
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
on top of that gasoline prices have
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
surged from two dollars a gallon to 330
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
a gallon and even more today since i
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
wrote this
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
effectively the biden administration has
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
already implemented a massive carbon tax
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
earlier this legislative session the
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
transportation and climate initiative
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
tci was rejected by this legislature and
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
tci was another carbon training
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
trading scheme
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
that was intended for 13 states from
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
north carolina to maine
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions were to be capped for
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
transportation fuels and carbon credits
 
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
would be sold to fuel suppliers the tci
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
was designed to achieve
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
the same carbon reduction by making gas
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
and oil prices more expensive
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
forcing consumers to ride share or take
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
mass transit
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
rising gas prices caused by the biden
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
administration effectively killed the
 
02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
tci plan resulting in the governor
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
formally rejecting the initiatives and
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
all the other governors following suit
 
02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:44.469 align:start position:0%
all the other governors following suit
finally

02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
the last federal plan clean
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
energy performance program is another
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
carbon reduction program in the pending
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
built back better legislation
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
it is also designed to make electric
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
prices rise
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line we don't need to accept
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
false climate models
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
and extremist solutions that our
 
02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
economy and our people
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
say no to carbon taxes and send that
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
message to our federal delegation
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
with that i will take questions
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for your
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
testimony i got a few things myself
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
and you know while you were speaking
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
some things that popped will you take
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions from me absolutely
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
um i i had flashbacks of my younger days
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
with tip o'neill and the kennedys my
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
grandfather was a four-term mayor in
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
cambridge massachusetts so i grew up at
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
the mall
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
and back then as a kid the sky was going
 
02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
to fall
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
it was called something else back then
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
then i joined the marines global cooling
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah warming that's right and i joined
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
the marines and all they kept hearing in
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
a few years we're done the sky's going
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
to fall
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
then i listened to vice president
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
al gore when i was in the marines and
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
for the record i retired from the marine
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
corps and all i heard was it's the end
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the world
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
in a couple of years we're done
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
um but since then i've seen the light in
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
my my grandfather used to tell me read
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
the almanac
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
is is the almanac i mean uh that they
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
always say you if you want to know
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the weather read
 
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
the the farmer's almanac
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
statement well there are a lot of people
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
that take that point of view
 
02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:30.150 align:start position:0%
that take that point of view
okay

02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
my my other thing was on this here is
 
02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
why is it always the united states
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
that has to do a redistribution of
 
02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
people's money
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
for this carbon tax where china and
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
other countries no big deal we we bow to
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
them how come
 
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
well i
 
02:25:52.389 --> 02:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
these carbon tax initiatives are driven
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
by people like uh
 
02:25:54.319 --> 02:25:55.670 align:start position:0%
by people like uh
uh

02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
john kerry and and others that want us
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
to quote unquote lead the way
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
and and uh are not
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
willing to force the same requirements
 
02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:07.910 align:start position:0%
willing to force the same requirements
on

02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
china or india or other
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
third world developing countries into
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
second or first world countries uh to
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
accept the same costs so i you know i i
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
can't explain their ill logic but that's
 
02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
what they want to do
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay for the record do you sit on
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
science and technology yes i'm on
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
science technology one of the big geeks
 
02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:32.150 align:start position:0%
science technology one of the big geeks
that

02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
keeps us straight in this information i
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you are there any
 
02:26:37.750 --> 02:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
other questions uh
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative uh
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
sure um well just to wax nostalgically i
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
remember mr coffler
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
in seventh grade teaching us about
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
something called the greenhouse effect
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
when i was born in 1958
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh there were 347 parts per million of
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide there's now 417 parts per
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
million of carbon dioxide 98 of all
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
climate scientists tell us that
 
02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:06.150 align:start position:0%
climate scientists tell us that
that

02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
sort of contrary to what you're saying
 
02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:11.110 align:start position:0%
sort of contrary to what you're saying
um

02:27:11.110 --> 02:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
what do you know about the greenhouse
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
effect and is it just not true was mr
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
koffler wrong in telling me about
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
well mr koffler is not wrong in telling
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
you about the greenhouse effect i think
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
some of the things that you might be
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
remembering are wrong
 
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh the greenhouse effect has caused by
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
the shortwave radiation coming in from
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
the sun
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
being easily passed through the
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
atmosphere but once it we do a little
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
heating of the of the earth the long
 
02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
wave radiation that
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
would is emitted
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
it does not all escape and that causes a
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
warming and and
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
there was a recent paper in the
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
international journal of atmosphere and
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
oceanic sciences december of this last
 
02:27:59.040 --> 02:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
oceanic sciences december of this last
year

02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
that describes how the earth itself
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:05.070 align:start position:0%
would be
uh

02:28:05.070 --> 02:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:08.469 --> 02:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
33 degrees kelvin
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:12.550 align:start position:0%
which is
centigrade

02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
centigrade
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
cooler did we not if we didn't have the
 
02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
greenhouse effect so 33 degrees of the
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
earth's current temperature centigrade
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
degrees would be we would be cooler now
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
they analyzed what are the contributors
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
to that greenhouse effect
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
the biggest greenhouse gas is water
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
vapor all the stuff in our clouds and
 
02:28:42.910 --> 02:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
that's responsible for
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
three

02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:51.510 align:start position:0%
i have the numbers here
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:53.429 align:start position:0%
i have the numbers here
[Music]

02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
3.3 degrees of that are caused by carbon
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
dioxide and .3 degrees of that are
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
caused by methane
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
why they want to have
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
cows no longer fart in the in the fields
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
and nitrous oxide um
 
02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:12.950 align:start position:0%
and nitrous oxide um
so

02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
that those are the facts of the
 
02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:16.550 align:start position:0%
that those are the facts of the
circumstance

02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:17.910 align:start position:0%
circumstance
so

02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:21.270 --> 02:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
the rising of the greenhouse gases that
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
are

02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to cause one half a degree
 
02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:30.469 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to cause one half a degree
centigrade

02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
centigrade
 
02:29:30.479 --> 02:29:32.469 align:start position:0%
centigrade
rise

02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
rise
 
02:29:32.479 --> 02:29:33.349 align:start position:0%
rise
from

02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide and the attendant water
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
vapor changes that happen with that
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
because of more cloud formation
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
point zero six and point zero eight
 
02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
respectively of the methane and nitrous
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
oxide this is a de minimis amount a day
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
minimus effect
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
additionally there are two other papers
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
that have recently been published that
 
02:29:57.439 --> 02:29:59.349 align:start position:0%
that have recently been published that
basically

02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:30:02.309 --> 02:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
describe the effect of carbon dioxide in
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere and
 
02:30:04.479 --> 02:30:05.270 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere and
and

02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:06.150 align:start position:0%
and
it's

02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:07.830 align:start position:0%
it's
uh

02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
and how it impacts um
 
02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
the temperature rise and and
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
it effectively says
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
the higher the the amount of carbon
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
dioxide the less the carbon dioxide has
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
an effect i i reference uh
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
um le chatelier's
 
02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:31.349 align:start position:0%
um le chatelier's
principle

02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
principle
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
basically what this would say is the
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
first 100 parts per million causes 70
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
impact of temperature
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
the next
 
02:30:46.479 --> 02:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
the next
100

02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
100
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
going from 100 to 200 you you get up to
 
02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:52.150 align:start position:0%
going from 100 to 200 you you get up to
81

02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
81
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
of the effect going from
 
02:30:58.950 --> 02:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh 200 to 300 you get up to 96 of the
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
effect and
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
above that is your is your remaining
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
four percent is that last increment of
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide essentially
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the more you add
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
the less the
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
effect well thank you for that uh
 
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
of course when they speak on the floor
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
there a lot of us are lost you know and
 
02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
there a lot of us are lost you know and
but

02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
you know they're the knowledgeable ones
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
there any other questions uh
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
deloomis thank you thank you mr chairman
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:31:38.309 --> 02:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
know that plants give off carbon dioxide
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
and they do use carbon monoxide they use
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
it and they and they expel it right also
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
yes right so at night at night they do
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
it and sometimes and parts of the day
 
02:31:50.309 --> 02:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
when the sun comes out then you've got
 
02:31:50.319 --> 02:31:52.150 align:start position:0%
when the sun comes out then you've got
photosynthesis

02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
photosynthesis
 
02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:53.830 align:start position:0%
photosynthesis
so

02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
if we cut down all my question is if we
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
cut down all the trees in the
 
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
rain forests
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
i i eliminated the carbon dioxide that
 
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
they would they would emit i i well
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
since the plants are large contributors
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
i i i understand your your point i think
 
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
the greater impact of cutting down uh
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
the trees is is going to
 
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
cause less sequestering of carbon
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
dioxide in fact one of the
 
02:32:28.399 --> 02:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
dioxide in fact one of the
the

02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
the methods people talk about about
 
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
addressing co2 buildup is
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh planting more trees
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
so that the trees uh when they
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
when they photosynthesize and grow and
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
capture that carbon in their wood and
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
and whatnot they are they are reducing
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
the net carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
 
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
as you as if you remember in my
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
testimony i made the statement
 
02:32:57.359 --> 02:32:58.270 align:start position:0%
testimony i made the statement
that

02:32:58.270 --> 02:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:58.280 --> 02:32:59.910 align:start position:0%
that
agriculturally

02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
agriculturally
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
increased levels of carbon dioxide have
 
02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
been a good thing for this planet and if
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
you go to sophisticated greenhouses and
 
02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
you want to understand how they can
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
push plant growth and get things ready
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
for the season one of the things they do
 
02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
for the season one of the things they do
is

02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
tightly isolate those those houses and
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere so
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
the plants grow faster so it's a vet a
 
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
would you take one more question
 
02:33:34.399 --> 02:33:36.870 align:start position:0%
would you take one more question
absolutely

02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
well i am a gardener
 
02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
and uh i
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to ask if you feel that
 
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's a good natural balance that the
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
that we have on earth that our balance
 
02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:49.910 align:start position:0%
that we have on earth that our balance
is

02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
between the oxygen and the carbon
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
dioxide is
 
02:33:57.270 --> 02:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
fairly static and and uh and would
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
sustain life
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
as we know it and has been for
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
the next few thousand years or
 
02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
well i i would agree with that i think
 
02:34:08.950 --> 02:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
that you know even
 
02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:10.150 align:start position:0%
that you know even
even

02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
though the modern industrial society is
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
clearly contributing
 
02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:15.670 align:start position:0%
clearly contributing
to

02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
a a modest increase in carbon dioxide
 
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
one of the other recent papers that that
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
has been published this time in in
 
02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
has been published this time in in
climate

02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
climate
 
02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:28.150 align:start position:0%
climate
describes

02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
describes
 
02:34:30.150 --> 02:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
what the levels of carbon dioxide have
 
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
been in the atmosphere
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh by they've
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
looked at the stable isotopes
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
over the uh
 
02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:39.429 align:start position:0%
over the uh
the

02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:39.439 --> 02:34:40.590 align:start position:0%
the
last

02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
435 million years
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay so in that paper
 
02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
they found a negative a modest but
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
negative correlation between
 
02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of carbon dioxide in the
 
02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:56.830 align:start position:0%
the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere

02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
and and warming uh there are times
 
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:02.630 align:start position:0%
and and warming uh there are times
in

02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
ancient past when the carbon dioxide
 
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
levels in the atmosphere were
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than they are now
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
and i do not believe that the modest
 
02:35:17.270 --> 02:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
amount of carbon dioxide
 
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
change that we're now seeing is going to
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
significant impact on on humans in fact
 
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that humans are very
 
02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
good at doing is adapting to their
 
02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:32.309 align:start position:0%
good at doing is adapting to their
environment

02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering all right thank
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
you representative seeing that
 
02:35:37.990 --> 02:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
there are no other questions we thank
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony it was definitely
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
a learning process for me that was
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful yeah it was wonderful
 
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
testimony there and most people
 
02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:46.630 align:start position:0%
testimony there and most people
really

02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
don't look oh do you have a
 
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i didn't see it
 
02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:35:56.710 --> 02:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
do you see any parallel
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
between the consequences that resulted
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
as the denial of the pandemic and its
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
resulting consequences
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
could be a parallel to the possibility
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
of longer
 
02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
of longer
term

02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
effects of denial of the carbon
 
02:36:19.439 --> 02:36:23.270 align:start position:0%
effects of denial of the carbon
emissions

02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
short answer no
 
02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:25.830 align:start position:0%
short answer no
uh

02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
but first i would uh not agree with your
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
initial premise that there was a denial
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
i think what there has been is a
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
disagreement as time has gone on about
 
02:36:43.349 --> 02:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
what the proper methods to address the
 
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic are
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
and that has been characterized by those
 
02:36:50.230 --> 02:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
that don't like that as denial i believe
 
02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
that is inaccurate
 
02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
seeing so thank you very much uh for
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you the chair
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
recognized uh representative janine nada
 
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:04.950 align:start position:0%
recognized uh representative janine nada
our

02:37:04.950 --> 02:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:11.270 align:start position:0%
our
whip

02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
committee

02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:37:17.190 --> 02:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
like representative bernardi and
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative vos i too am on the
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee of nerds and geeks also known
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
as science technology and energy i know
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
so the past four terms now i've been on
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
the committee of science technology and
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
energy and many times now we have heard
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
arguments for and against a carbon tax
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
i keep some of the past testimony in a
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
folder that has the eiffel tower on the
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
cover it serves as a reminder of the
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
crowds that took to the streets to
 
02:37:46.150 --> 02:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
protest the carbon tax that was imposed
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
on the people of france
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
serving in the new hampshire legislature
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
we often hear the same bills over and
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
over each term in this committee it was
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
the honor and remember flag that kept
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
02:37:59.830 --> 02:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
so let me tell you what a carbon tax
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
would mean for new hampshire
 
02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
new england convenience stores and
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
energy markets association testified
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
that every cent the state charges
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
through this plan will get pushed down
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
the various supply chains and ultimately
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
end up hitting new hampshire citizens in
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
the wallet
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
it will affect anyone who drives a car
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
heats their home or business or anyone
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
doing construction
 
02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
projects of any kind anyone who buys
 
02:38:24.550 --> 02:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
groceries or eats out in a restaurant
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
and on and on and on this tax will touch
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state multiple times
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
each and every day
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
this domino effect was further explained
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
by representative michael vose the
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
collapse of the new hampshire economy is
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
what this carbon tax will likely induce
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
since surrounding states will not have
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
adopted this tax energy prices in those
 
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
states will become lower than those here
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
people will drive to neighboring states
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
to buy cheaper gas
 
02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
renters especially those who commute out
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
of state for work will move there
 
02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
because apartment utilities will be
 
02:38:55.920 --> 02:38:56.790 align:start position:0%
because apartment utilities will be
lower

02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
lower
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
since all goods and services vendors in
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire will be subject to the
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
carbon tax the price of everything will
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
go up
 
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
this inflation will cut back on other
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
expenses such as labor
 
02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
jobs will be lost companies may
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
eventually be forced to recla relocate
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
out of state new hampshire will fall
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
into a death spiral
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
of economic chaos
 
02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
at a task force meeting at the american
 
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
legislators exchange council a slide was
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
presented to highlight our states and
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
the ridiculous carbon tax proposal
 
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is among the lowest in the
 
02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
0.0029 percent
 
02:39:40.469 --> 02:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
so let me repeat that point zero zero
 
02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
two nine percent of the u.s total
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
so how can anyone possibly rationalize
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
taxing the people of new hampshire and
 
02:39:51.429 --> 02:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking 300 to 800 million dollars
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
for such a minuscule return
 
02:39:56.469 --> 02:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the majority party at the time
 
02:39:58.790 --> 02:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
tabled the carbon tax bill to avoid
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
having the public hear the debate on
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
this disastrous legislation that spells
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
government overreach to the extreme
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
so as legislators we sometimes receive
 
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
literature from the heartland institute
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
you may hear testimony later today from
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
someone who will try to convince you
 
02:40:17.429 --> 02:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
that there that the heartland institute
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
is just a tiny little outfit that knows
 
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
nothing on the contrary the heartland
 
02:40:23.990 --> 02:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
institute has the respect of tens of
 
02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
thousands of scientists worldwide who
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
dispute that we are in a climate crisis
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that the public is only
 
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
told what those in charge of the media
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
and or administration want you to know
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
during a previous administration only
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
the climate alarmists got federal grants
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
and those in opposition got canceled
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
i had the opportunity to attend the
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
international climate conference this
 
02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
past october
 
02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
i took home stacks of books and read
 
02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
every one of them and i filled up this
 
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
entire notepad
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
with notes just from that conference in
 
02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
those books and i kept hearing no carbon
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
is good you need carbon you you need
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
carbon and we've had more carbon in the
 
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
air in times past
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
so true science dictates that questions
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
must always be asked
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
is science ever really settled
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
new information pops up every day
 
02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
so to sum it all up
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
a resolution is not a bill that knocks
 
02:41:23.279 --> 02:41:24.230 align:start position:0%
a resolution is not a bill that knocks
change

02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
it is a political statement that we do
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
not want to ruin our economy with an
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
unsustainable carbon tax like they
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
implemented and implemented in france
 
02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
put the granite staters first and pass
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
this resolution thank you well thank you
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
do we have a copy of your written
 
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
testimony too if we can
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
i have to meet a girl scout so you know
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
sitting here just listening to this
 
02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
stuff here and i think of um
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
the number came up if i'm not mistaken
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
was 308 million dollars coming in
 
02:41:56.309 --> 02:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know on uh this redistribution of
 
02:41:56.319 --> 02:41:57.429 align:start position:0%
you know on uh this redistribution of
money

02:41:57.429 --> 02:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh what is this doing to our electric
 
02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:00.790 align:start position:0%
uh what is this doing to our electric
bills

02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
keeps going up and up and up well let me
 
02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
tell you um
 
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
there was a scientist named
 
02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:07.269 align:start position:0%
there was a scientist named
holger

02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
holger
 
02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
i have his name here somewhere
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
holder i can't remember his last name at
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
the moment but he's from germany and he
 
02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
told me that there are people in germany
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they have the highest energy
 
02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
costs in the world followed by australia
 
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
in the united states it's california
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
that has the highest
 
02:42:27.030 --> 02:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
people cannot afford electricity in in
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
germany there's there's they're freezing
 
02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
and they want to do that to us here why
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
if people want to sit in the dark alone
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
and freeze i mean they're welcome to do
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
that but we shouldn't be forced to
 
02:42:36.399 --> 02:42:37.190 align:start position:0%
that but we shouldn't be forced to
right

02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
now they could move to germany yeah
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
another quest yeah they moved to germany
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
my next question would be is um
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
one of the phone calls and different
 
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
things i get from business owners are
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
from out of state that
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
would love to come to new hampshire but
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
they always complain about our high
 
02:42:55.750 --> 02:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
electric costs
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:57.830 align:start position:0%
i mean
what

02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:42:59.269 --> 02:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
can we do
 
02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
to straighten this out because i mean to
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
me this is a redistribution of money it
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
is and we've been doing great here in
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for many many years the
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
sky is not falling so what can we do to
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
attract more business that are
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
complaining about electric bills i mean
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
well on science and tech and energy
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
what we what we try to say is we have to
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
um chip away a little bit at a time
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
because we keep getting told every time
 
02:43:26.950 --> 02:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's a bill or something oh it's only
 
02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
the price of a cup of coffee it's only
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
the price of two cups of coffee well you
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
know we're talking about gallons and
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
gallons of coffee with all these little
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
taxes and fees so it keeps going up so
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
we have to chip away where we can
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
also well this is another committee but
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
i just put in a bill in ways and means
 
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
to continue lowering the business
 
02:43:45.429 --> 02:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
profits tax and business enterprise tax
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
because that will help
 
02:43:47.359 --> 02:43:48.710 align:start position:0%
because that will help
bring

02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
bring
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
businesses to want to come here
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
and also um
 
02:43:54.309 --> 02:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be a nerd or a geek to
 
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
to want to know what the energy prices
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
are so there's this little app called
 
02:43:59.110 --> 02:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
iso to go
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
so it's free you
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
download it to your phone and you can
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
see real time what the energy costs in
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so right now it's 168
 
02:44:11.590 --> 02:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
dollars and five cents per megawatt
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
my last question here maybe you can help
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
me out understand this here
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
is what that 308 million dollars 300 to
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
800 million 300 800 million 800 million
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah what does what does that money go
 
02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
what do you i mean besides helping low
 
02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:29.030 align:start position:0%
what do you i mean besides helping low
income

02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
with their homes that's awful a lot of
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
them what are we doing with that money
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
why don't they just leave it where
 
02:44:38.309 --> 02:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
with the people where it belongs they
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
they take it and they like redistribute
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
it like they'll give it to someone here
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
and it's like you spend 100 today to
 
02:44:47.269 --> 02:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
maybe get 70 back later on it's a big
 
02:44:47.279 --> 02:44:48.469 align:start position:0%
maybe get 70 back later on it's a big
long

02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:44:50.469 --> 02:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh complicated um
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
system so just leave it alone just don't
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
no carbon tax just you don't need it
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
but what are they how is it making a
 
02:45:00.710 --> 02:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
difference in the carpenter i mean in
 
02:45:03.269 --> 02:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
the carbon
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
i mean with that you know with the money
 
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're taken from because of producing
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
carbon or trees is somebody taxing the
 
02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
trees or
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean where it's
 
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
producing all this carbon they will
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
tax the air we breathe
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay i mean that's why i'm confused on
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
why so much money's coming in
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
and that i mean elderly in my district
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
are complaining you know it's the same
 
02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:26.790 align:start position:0%
are complaining you know it's the same
thing

02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
they're putting the heat down to 65 or
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
60 you know just to stay because of the
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
cost and electricity and oil and other
 
02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:36.630 align:start position:0%
cost and electricity and oil and other
okay

02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:45:40.389 --> 02:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative chase uh thank you mr
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative notter
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question so so let's
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
assume right let's let's entertain the
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
idea that that that this issue could be
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
solved via carbon tax right let's let's
 
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
make that assumption
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
um my question though is don't we
 
02:45:59.429 --> 02:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
already have a a regulatory system
 
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
reggie right the greenhouse green uh
 
02:46:03.429 --> 02:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
02:46:06.389 --> 02:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
reggie is an energy tax it's an and so
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
um has that been effective in reducing
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases and how has that money
 
02:46:12.389 --> 02:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
been reinvested in new hampshire right
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
is that is that current system is that
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
working is that successful and would if
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
that is successful would it not prove
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't need a carbon tax we
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
already have our own system or if it
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
isn't successful wouldn't it just
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
further prove that a carbon tax probably
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work if reggie's not working
 
02:46:29.910 --> 02:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm lost in your question but um i
 
02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:31.030 align:start position:0%
i'm lost in your question but um i
always

02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
always
 
02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor a co-sponsor bill every year to
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
try and get rid of reggie
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that was a disaster okay um
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else uh you had a question
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative uh nada appreciate your
 
02:46:48.399 --> 02:46:49.990 align:start position:0%
representative uh nada appreciate your
testimony

the chair welcome that opposes the bill
 
02:46:52.399 --> 02:46:54.469 align:start position:0%
the chair welcome that opposes the bill
um

02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
wharton sinclair we finally get them up
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you chair to the committee yeah
 
02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my name is wharton
 
02:47:18.830 --> 02:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
sinclair and i'm from sandwich new
 
02:47:22.469 --> 02:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i was curious do we have
 
02:47:24.309 --> 02:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
numbers on
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh on the on the record of how many
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
opposed and in favor of h.r 17
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
no i don't
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
i have the numbers um
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
i will i mean i'm sure there are online
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh in-person uh indications of the
 
02:47:45.429 --> 02:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
numbers of uh pro and conor i can just
 
02:47:47.349 --> 02:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
like to know those numbers i mean i can
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
get the numbers there uh um okay
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
assistant there will get it first but i
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
can tell you myself as a legislator for
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
the town of londonderry
 
02:47:57.670 --> 02:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
i look at what it's costing my elderly
 
02:47:59.910 --> 02:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
and other stuff so even though there's
 
02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
people all around the country calling in
 
02:48:04.870 --> 02:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
and opposing us here emails i got from
 
02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
out of state and i'm saying oh they they
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
want us and then there was some from
 
02:48:11.349 --> 02:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
in-state so don't get me wrong but they
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
they would love for us to you know keep
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
redistributing people's money and all
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm doing is hurting my seniors and
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
low-income people but go ahead so my
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
comments are as follows
 
02:48:25.750 --> 02:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
we in this country have always embraced
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
good science and good technology and it
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
served us extremely well
 
02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
right now we you know we've done things
 
02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:34.790 align:start position:0%
right now we you know we've done things
like

02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
addressing the ozone
 
02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
ozone layer destruction very effectively
 
02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
by phasing out the chemicals
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
that were causing that damage to the
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
ozone layer and exposing people to uv
 
02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:48.870 align:start position:0%
ozone layer and exposing people to uv
light

02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
light
 
02:48:51.269 --> 02:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
we can do we have a problem right now
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
the scientists are telling us that as
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
the representative to my right here
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out earlier
 
02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:58.630 align:start position:0%
pointed out earlier
98

02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
98
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
of climate scientists
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
are in agreement that climate change is
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
real it's happening it's caused by our
 
02:49:10.150 --> 02:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide emissions primarily
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh from the use of fossil fuels
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it's having uh profound effects
 
02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
right now those are not modeled effects
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
they are real uh we are experiencing sea
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
level rise we are experiencing a lot
 
02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
large loss of ice
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
from glaciers and at our poles
 
02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:32.070 align:start position:0%
from glaciers and at our poles
and

02:49:32.070 --> 02:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:35.269 --> 02:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
we are experiencing severe heat waves
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
and record temperatures and wildfires
 
02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
all of which
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
have been scientifically related to
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
the climate change that we're causing
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
with our carbon dioxide emissions
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that you know i would
 
02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
like to think that we as a society
 
02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
can grasp science and address and solve
 
02:49:57.920 --> 02:49:58.790 align:start position:0%
can grasp science and address and solve
with

02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
good sound policy
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out that h.r 17
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
in its uh in its points opposing carbon
 
02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:09.590 align:start position:0%
in its uh in its points opposing carbon
taxes

02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
essentially paints a caricature of a
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
badly designed
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
carbon tax
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's not really related to real
 
02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
proposals of carbon taxes or carbon
 
02:50:21.439 --> 02:50:23.030 align:start position:0%
proposals of carbon taxes or carbon
pricing

02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
02:50:25.349 --> 02:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
for example um
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
the the hr 17
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
suggests that
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
with a with carbon pricing we would end
 
02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:33.670 align:start position:0%
with a with carbon pricing we would end
up

02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
hurting our
 
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
competitiveness but in reality the bills
 
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
that are that are on that are actually
 
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
being considered that implement carbon
 
02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
pricing as a means of creating the
 
02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
incentives to use less fossil fuels
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
those bills all include measures such as
 
02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
a carbon border adjustment mechanism
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
or cbam which would basically
 
02:50:57.600 --> 02:50:59.510 align:start position:0%
or cbam which would basically
uh

02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:51:02.710 --> 02:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
it would force exporters to the us who
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't have an equivalent carbon price
 
02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
to pay a border adjustment on the goods
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're importing to us
 
02:51:11.750 --> 02:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
so this would protect the
 
02:51:13.269 --> 02:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of american
 
02:51:13.279 --> 02:51:14.950 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of american
manufacturing

02:51:14.950 --> 02:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
by levying
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
essentially the equivalent carbon tax on
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
goods as they're imported that's that's
 
02:51:22.319 --> 02:51:23.349 align:start position:0%
goods as they're imported that's that's
real

02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
real
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing policy and what hr 17
 
02:51:28.150 --> 02:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
discusses isn't
 
02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
real it's a caricature of poorly
 
02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:31.510 align:start position:0%
real it's a caricature of poorly
designed

02:51:31.510 --> 02:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
designed
 
02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing meant to
 
02:51:37.269 --> 02:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
to scare legislators and to mislead the
 
02:51:40.150 --> 02:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
public about what carbon pricing really
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
is and what it can accomplish
 
02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
another example is that it talks about
 
02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
electricity prices
 
02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
as being immediately and substantially
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
increased by a carbon tax well obviously
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
that depends how that carbon tax is
 
02:52:00.309 --> 02:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
is introduced does it start small and go
 
02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
up over time we in new hampshire we
 
02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
already generate more than 60 percent of
 
02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
the electricity we consume
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
with non-emitting sources so we're
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
actually already quite far ahead of the
 
02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:13.590 align:start position:0%
actually already quite far ahead of the
curve

02:52:13.590 --> 02:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
curve
 
02:52:15.590 --> 02:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you have a small and steadily
 
02:52:18.389 --> 02:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
increasing price on fossil based carbon
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
you'll promote
 
02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
the utilities to move away from fossil
 
02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
fuel energy and you'll give them time to
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
do it and an incentive to do it
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
and by doing that in fact they avoid the
 
02:52:32.630 --> 02:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
tax completely
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
so the tax may not
 
02:52:37.269 --> 02:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
really even show up that much but by
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
being present and creating incentives it
 
02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
leads us in the right direction away
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
from the use of fossil fuels which are
 
02:52:46.070 --> 02:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
causing this problem
 
02:52:48.389 --> 02:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
which i discussed earlier due to global
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
warming global warming these are facts
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have sea level rise we have
 
02:52:53.520 --> 02:52:55.110 align:start position:0%
we have sea level rise we have
uh

02:52:55.110 --> 02:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the
 
02:52:59.670 --> 02:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
the warmest years on record have all
 
02:53:02.150 --> 02:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
been in the last seven years
 
02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:03.269 align:start position:0%
been in the last seven years
uh

02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:05.830 --> 02:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's real data and uh
 
02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think by slamming the door on carbon
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
pricing without carefully considering
 
02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
what a good carbon price would entail
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
we're really throwing the baby out with
 
02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
the with the wash water
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we should
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
we should not uh we should not do that
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is misguided and
 
02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:27.030 align:start position:0%
this bill is misguided and
in

02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
trying to preempt
 
02:53:31.830 --> 02:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
a policy without carefully considering
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know the nuance the caveats how it
 
02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
can be structured positively for our
 
02:53:38.469 --> 02:53:38.479 align:start position:0%
city for our citizens and for our
 
02:53:38.479 --> 02:53:39.910 align:start position:0%
city for our citizens and for our
residents

02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh and that's all i have thank you very
 
02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:42.870 align:start position:0%
uh and that's all i have thank you very
much

02:53:42.870 --> 02:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
will you accept uh
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
questions sure absolutely
 
02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
some of you you brought up there that
 
02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
on the use of uh you said we used we
 
02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:00.389 --> 02:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
i'm no uh you know representative branch
 
02:54:03.750 --> 02:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
who's one of our gurus and uh
 
02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know brilliant on this uh issues
 
02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
you know brilliant on this uh issues
here

02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
and i know when i look at studies you
 
02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
say 98 of the scientists
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
but i see other studies that disagree
 
02:54:16.230 --> 02:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
with many many studies disagree
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay on this area here but my question
 
02:54:22.070 --> 02:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
is what the electric cars that they're
 
02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:23.910 align:start position:0%
is what the electric cars that they're
pushing

02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
02:54:29.349 --> 02:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
and what does that do to electric
 
02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
companies that have to produce
 
02:54:33.359 --> 02:54:34.550 align:start position:0%
companies that have to produce
more

02:54:34.550 --> 02:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
um electricity and they must be doing
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
put more
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the air or carbon or whatever in the
 
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
air i mean what does that do i mean
 
02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
we uh we i own an electric car and i
 
02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
charge it overnight and
 
02:54:52.230 --> 02:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
between 1am and 5am
 
02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
almost certainly the electricity i'm
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
using to charge my car comes from our
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
nuclear plant at seabrook it's
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
completely emissions free
 
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah if we as we transition to more
 
02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:09.670 align:start position:0%
yeah if we as we transition to more
electric

02:55:09.670 --> 02:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
electric
 
02:55:12.790 --> 02:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
electricity in our transportation sector
 
02:55:15.349 --> 02:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
we will need to improve our electric
 
02:55:18.150 --> 02:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
grid we will need to add supply
 
02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
but we should get going on that that's
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
something that putting a price on
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
will really
 
02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
encourage us to do aggressively we need
 
02:55:31.190 --> 02:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
to move fast with this because the
 
02:55:33.269 --> 02:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
threat to our children and grandchildren
 
02:55:34.630 --> 02:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
is real
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh we will not have the same climate
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we're already
 
02:55:40.230 --> 02:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
seeing last summer heat waves that
 
02:55:42.309 --> 02:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been at all you know
 
02:55:44.469 --> 02:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
common or they would be
 
02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
they would have been extremely
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh rare 30 years ago
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
okay um i'm hoping representative branch
 
02:55:53.429 --> 02:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
is taking notes because i'm going to ask
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
him to come back up if you don't mind at
 
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
the end to help my committee out and
 
02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
decipher some of the things that have
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
been said here before we go to
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
executives there to make a difference
 
02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:03.750 align:start position:0%
executives there to make a difference
but

02:56:03.750 --> 02:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:56:05.429 --> 02:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
with your electric car one question
 
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
there would help us on some of the votes
 
02:56:09.190 --> 02:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
that we get
 
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
you're not paying any road tax anymore
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
because you're not getting gas
 
02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
what's that going to do to the highways
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
i mean the highways are funded from uh
 
02:56:22.230 --> 02:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
gasoline taxes but they're also you want
 
02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
to get rid of fossil fuels but they're
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
also funded in very large measure
 
02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:28.230 align:start position:0%
also funded in very large measure
by

02:56:28.230 --> 02:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
regular income taxes federal income
 
02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
taxes because
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
the gasoline tax the federal gasoline
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
tax hasn't increased since 1992
 
02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:38.950 align:start position:0%
tax hasn't increased since 1992
so

02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
so you and i
 
02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
when we when we pay our income tax to
 
02:56:45.990 --> 02:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
uncle sam we're actually supporting
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh we're supporting transportation so if
 
02:56:50.230 --> 02:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
i may
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
because we're
 
02:56:53.429 --> 02:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
moving along now a lot of time here but
 
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
if i may i just need you to answer me
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
i'm talking new hampshire new hampshire
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
maintains their roads by the gas tax
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
not by the taxpayers uh you know the gas
 
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
tax watch is used and then we bond
 
02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
to fix certain roads that are paid by
 
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
those general fund then in the gas tax
 
02:57:14.710 --> 02:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
so with all these electric cars
 
02:57:16.950 --> 02:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking your recommendation
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
how do you ex
 
02:57:22.710 --> 02:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
how do you recommend us to tax you to me
 
02:57:24.230 --> 02:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
because you're driving a car you're not
 
02:57:27.429 --> 02:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
using fuel i mean i do agree with you in
 
02:57:27.439 --> 02:57:28.630 align:start position:0%
using fuel i mean i do agree with you in
principle

02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
principle
 
02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
the the roads do need to be paid for and
 
02:57:33.429 --> 02:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
at some point it will be appropriate to
 
02:57:33.439 --> 02:57:34.710 align:start position:0%
at some point it will be appropriate to
levy

02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
levy
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh tax to you know on electric vehicles
 
02:57:39.670 --> 02:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
to help pay for the roads
 
02:57:41.110 --> 02:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know right now the sector is
 
02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
extremely small and it's actually
 
02:57:45.670 --> 02:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
important that it be allowed to grow
 
02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
so prematurely slapping a punitive tax
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
on electric vehicles is i think a bad
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
idea right now that's my personal
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
opinion yeah i mean the principle you
 
02:57:58.389 --> 02:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
bring up there about paying for our
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
roads and services is important and i
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
agree with it okay because we're losing
 
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
money in our gas tax that's why i'm
 
02:58:08.309 --> 02:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chair and thank you for
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh
 
02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
would you believe that um
 
02:58:20.309 --> 02:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
that are you know in december was the
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know it was nine degrees warmer than
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
the average um
 
02:58:26.309 --> 02:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this year was
 
02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
yeah nine degrees warmer than the
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
average in uh in massachusetts or in new
 
02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:30.950 align:start position:0%
average in uh in massachusetts or in new
hampshire

02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh our december you know i don't have
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
the i don't have at my fingertips the
 
02:58:39.870 --> 02:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
state uh
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
climatologist's uh conclusions for the
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the month of december is that
 
02:58:46.710 --> 02:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
is that yeah that's what i saw on the
 
02:58:48.870 --> 02:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
news the other day right yeah
 
02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
it was a very warm fall and right into
 
02:58:53.429 --> 02:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
december that's correct
 
02:58:55.510 --> 02:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
02:58:57.670 --> 02:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
i can tell you i left went to florida
 
02:58:59.429 --> 02:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
there because it was too cold it was
 
02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
colder than normal in my book but i had
 
02:59:03.349 --> 02:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and i i want to
 
02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
you mr chair for allowing me to ask a
 
02:59:11.190 --> 02:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
i i too i drive a hybrid vehicle and i
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
drove here today and i
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
got about 78 the equivalent of 78 miles
 
02:59:20.710 --> 02:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
to the gallon with my hybrid
 
02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:21.590 align:start position:0%
to the gallon with my hybrid
uh

02:59:21.590 --> 02:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:59:24.389 --> 02:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle so i guess i am contributing to
 
02:59:27.030 --> 02:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
the demise of new hampshire roads by not
 
02:59:30.550 --> 02:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
burning enough fossil fuels no
 
02:59:30.560 --> 02:59:31.429 align:start position:0%
burning enough fossil fuels no
but

02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:59:33.269 --> 02:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
i want to ask you it was previously in
 
02:59:35.349 --> 02:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
previous testimony we heard that the
 
02:59:36.710 --> 02:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
united states
 
02:59:40.070 --> 02:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
produces a very small amount of the co2
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
in the world
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm seeing according to the union of
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
concerned scientists that
 
02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
we are one of the top we are the top co2
 
02:59:51.190 --> 02:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
emitting country in the world that we
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
emit 24.5
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the co2 compared to 13.9 percent
 
03:00:00.230 --> 03:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
produced by china
 
03:00:01.590 --> 03:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
can you resolve this do you know
 
03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
anything about this are we are we
 
03:00:05.030 --> 03:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
actually very tiny contributors or is
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
the union of con concerned scientist
 
03:00:09.030 --> 03:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
data incorrect
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know i believe we were passed by
 
03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
china not long ago like without actually
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
looking up numbers i'm afraid i'm not
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
exactly the expert on this but uh we are
 
03:00:22.550 --> 03:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
certainly as a nation one of the largest
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh in emitters in the world of the gases
 
03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
uh in emitters in the world of the gases
that

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
are causing global warming
 
03:00:32.309 --> 03:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr single for the record are
 
03:00:34.389 --> 03:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
you a scientist are you
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
i actually am a material scientist so i
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
have a phd
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
in a field that's not related to climate
 
03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
in a field that's not related to climate
but

03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
i am scientifically trained i have some
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
background in chemistry
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
and physics and uh
 
03:00:50.230 --> 03:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that's my
 
03:00:52.870 --> 03:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired researcher
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay one last uh representative dilemma
 
03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:00:59.670 --> 03:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:01:01.590 --> 03:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's going to probably be a
 
03:01:03.429 --> 03:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
silly question to you
 
03:01:03.439 --> 03:01:04.550 align:start position:0%
silly question to you
but

03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
considering that we've had an ice age
 
03:01:08.469 --> 03:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
and you do do you believe that there was
 
03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
an ice age okay absolutely considering
 
03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
we've had an ice age and considering
 
03:01:15.429 --> 03:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
that greenland did in fact grow crops
 
03:01:17.110 --> 03:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that's
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
fairly common knowledge
 
03:01:22.230 --> 03:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
how would you explain the warming that
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
took place from the ice age to
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
the heat that it would take to have
 
03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
green land produce
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh plants and then now you're saying
 
03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:33.110 align:start position:0%
uh plants and then now you're saying
that

03:01:33.110 --> 03:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
with the with the infinitesimal amounts
 
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
of of carbon that that we were just told
 
03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
of of carbon that that we were just told
about

03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
by my esteemed colleague
 
03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
by my esteemed colleague
that

03:01:43.030 --> 03:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're able to affect any change if the
 
03:01:48.790 --> 03:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
if globally the sun probably had a fair
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
amount to do with the warming of the
 
03:01:51.520 --> 03:01:52.950 align:start position:0%
amount to do with the warming of the
planet

03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
planet
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
are you
 
03:01:56.630 --> 03:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
by having hybrid cars and and stopping
 
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
the emissions that we produce now which
 
03:02:05.750 --> 03:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
also do benefit the growth of plants
 
03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to affect
 
03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to all drown in the raising
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
waters from the ocean i i i'm confused
 
03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
i mean there are a lot of questions you
 
03:02:18.790 --> 03:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
you asked actually quite quite a few
 
03:02:20.550 --> 03:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
questions some of them you can make it
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
some of them would require a lot of a
 
03:02:25.750 --> 03:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion to resolve you know i
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
think there's
 
03:02:28.389 --> 03:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
there are certainly some very good
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
sources on the causes of the ice ages it
 
03:02:34.389 --> 03:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
was actually more than one
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them have to do with
 
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
earth's orbit around the sun and angles
 
03:02:42.070 --> 03:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
of inclination between the axis of the
 
03:02:46.710 --> 03:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
03:02:51.269 --> 03:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
this material is
 
03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
something that scientists
 
03:02:56.790 --> 03:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
climate scientists are well aware of and
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
there are good scientific explanations
 
03:03:01.429 --> 03:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
for ice ages
 
03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
and um in the context of our complete
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
fairly complete and rigorous
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of the earth's climate
 
03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:10.070 align:start position:0%
understanding of the earth's climate
system

03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
we are still able to say that
 
03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:14.309 align:start position:0%
we are still able to say that
our

03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide emissions are disrupting
 
03:03:20.469 --> 03:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
the climate that we have today and will
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
be causing
 
03:03:23.670 --> 03:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
substantial warming have already caused
 
03:03:25.190 --> 03:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
substantial warming and that that's a
 
03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing we can't let that just
 
03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
go on unabated and expect to enjoy our
 
03:03:35.110 --> 03:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:37.269 --> 03:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful climate here in new hampshire
 
03:03:38.950 --> 03:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
and you know play other parts of the
 
03:03:42.389 --> 03:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
world will really suffer
 
03:03:44.309 --> 03:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
very unduly
 
03:03:46.950 --> 03:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
because of heat and sea level rise thank
 
03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:48.150 align:start position:0%
because of heat and sea level rise thank
you

03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:03:50.230 --> 03:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes i do mr chairman
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
03:03:59.510 --> 03:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
as a scientist do you believe that there
 
03:04:03.670 --> 03:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
is a correlation
 
03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:05.110 align:start position:0%
is a correlation
between

03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:04:07.830 --> 03:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
the availability and cost of energy in a
 
03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:09.110 align:start position:0%
the availability and cost of energy in a
society

03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
society
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the average standard of living
 
03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:04:17.110 --> 03:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
use of energy does certainly contribute
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
to our well-being but this having a
 
03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
having putting a price on fossil based
 
03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:26.230 align:start position:0%
having putting a price on fossil based
carbon

03:04:26.230 --> 03:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
is not uh
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
the the end of energy use as we know it
 
03:04:33.670 --> 03:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
that certainly is would be unacceptable
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
and but i you know again this goes back
 
03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
and but i you know again this goes back
to

03:04:36.870 --> 03:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:37.670 align:start position:0%
to
uh

03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
over generalization about carbon pricing
 
03:04:44.230 --> 03:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of well-designed versus
 
03:04:47.110 --> 03:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
poorly designed and if we are careful
 
03:04:49.750 --> 03:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
and deliberate carefully about
 
03:04:52.710 --> 03:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
how exactly to implement something like
 
03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
a carbon price
 
03:04:56.309 --> 03:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
we can accomplish what we need to
 
03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish with respect to climate
 
03:05:00.070 --> 03:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
change without
 
03:05:03.750 --> 03:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know sacrificing and having our
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
citizens sacrifice uh in their life in
 
03:05:09.190 --> 03:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
their standard of living
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
oh really
 
03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
you don't want to real quick
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah no i'll give you a follow-up i was
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
just wondering uh when you tax them on
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
the carbon does the carbon like
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
automatically go away because we took
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
their money
 
03:05:22.230 --> 03:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know i mean so but go ahead
 
03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
represent foster
 
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
with that said do you think that a
 
03:05:30.389 --> 03:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
carbon tax would have a positive or
 
03:05:33.990 --> 03:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
negative effect on the average standard
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
of living within our society
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i think a well-designed carbon
 
03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:41.429 align:start position:0%
i mean i think a well-designed carbon
tax

03:05:41.429 --> 03:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:05:43.750 --> 03:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know is an economic question really
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
so it's a question
 
03:05:45.359 --> 03:05:46.790 align:start position:0%
so it's a question
of

03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
properly designed carbon tax does that
 
03:05:52.870 --> 03:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
increase gdp or does it increase jobs
 
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
or does it increase
 
03:05:57.429 --> 03:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
our population's health
 
03:05:58.550 --> 03:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
there are economists who've carefully
 
03:06:03.190 --> 03:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
considered this question
 
03:06:05.190 --> 03:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
and the answers that they have come up
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
with is that
 
03:06:09.030 --> 03:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
what a carbon tax will do
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
is effective at reducing carbon
 
03:06:10.800 --> 03:06:12.230 align:start position:0%
is effective at reducing carbon
emissions

03:06:12.230 --> 03:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
without sacrificing jobs or standard of
 
03:06:15.359 --> 03:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
without sacrificing jobs or standard of
living

03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
living
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
or if those sa if there are sacrifices
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
very small and negligible
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
um certainly on
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
issues such as health
 
03:06:29.910 --> 03:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know transitioning away from fossil
 
03:06:33.190 --> 03:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
fuels removes a lot of
 
03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know air quality burdens
 
03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
that impact
 
03:06:39.429 --> 03:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
americans and not so much in new
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire but
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
certainly in our big cities and adjacent
 
03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
to our highways you know having
 
03:06:49.830 --> 03:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
less uh just air pollution is is a is a
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
beneficial side effect of
 
03:06:52.399 --> 03:06:53.190 align:start position:0%
beneficial side effect of
uh

03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:56.309 --> 03:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know moving our energy use away from
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
polluting fossil fuels
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:07:01.349 --> 03:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you of course you know we're here
 
03:07:02.710 --> 03:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
concerned with what's going on in new
 
03:07:02.720 --> 03:07:03.750 align:start position:0%
concerned with what's going on in new
hampshire

03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
since we're taking people our bit money
 
03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
out of their pockets
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
but they thank you very much very very
 
03:07:11.429 --> 03:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
interesting testimony and i like
 
03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
listening to both sides anyways thanks
 
03:07:16.150 --> 03:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
for allowing me
 
03:07:18.790 --> 03:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
for years just testify
 
03:07:18.800 --> 03:07:20.309 align:start position:0%
for years just testify
um

03:07:20.309 --> 03:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
is it phil or is it yeah brown phil
 
03:07:23.040 --> 03:07:24.469 align:start position:0%
is it phil or is it yeah brown phil
brown

03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
brown
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh who opposes the bill
 
03:07:29.349 --> 03:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
oh hi
 
03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to the resolution yes
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
oh by the way your other answer you were
 
03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
asking how many supported or
 
03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
140 opposed in for support which is
 
03:07:40.870 --> 03:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
normal for this type of bill
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
because they come in from all over the
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
place and uh on these bills and a lot of
 
03:07:47.830 --> 03:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
them i want to pull the list a lot of
 
03:07:49.269 --> 03:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
them are all activists and they come
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
from out of state too but thank you
 
03:07:52.479 --> 03:07:54.710 align:start position:0%
from out of state too but thank you
okay

03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
yes welcome mr brown
 
03:07:58.950 --> 03:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
good day my name is phil brown i'm a
 
03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
retired science teacher from concord
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
high school
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
taught science at all grades and in all
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
science areas for 35 years here in the
 
03:08:07.279 --> 03:08:08.469 align:start position:0%
science areas for 35 years here in the
state

03:08:08.469 --> 03:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm i'm in opposition to this
 
03:08:13.030 --> 03:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
resolution and and
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
i gave you a piece of paper
 
03:08:17.030 --> 03:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
that i actually
 
03:08:20.469 --> 03:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh brought to bear for house
 
03:08:23.590 --> 03:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
hb 1657 it was about local foods for
 
03:08:24.870 --> 03:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
local schools
 
03:08:29.110 --> 03:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
did you get did all of you folks get one
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
of these
 
03:08:34.389 --> 03:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay if you look at this side
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
there are two data tables here
 
03:08:39.670 --> 03:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
the first data table
 
03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
relates to a 20-year period from roughly
 
03:08:42.399 --> 03:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
relates to a 20-year period from roughly
1981

03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
1981
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
or 19 yes uh 1981 to 2000.
 
03:08:50.230 --> 03:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
and this is a data table that was
 
03:08:53.590 --> 03:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
created by uh looking at the
 
03:08:55.750 --> 03:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
noaa which is the national ocean and
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
graphic and atmospheric administration
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
does every year they study the number of
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
billion dollar disasters
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
billion-dollar disasters in this country
 
03:09:08.720 --> 03:09:10.150 align:start position:0%
billion-dollar disasters in this country
right

03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:09:13.990 --> 03:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the 20-year period from 81 to 2000
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
they were i don't have my spectacles so
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping i can read it correctly there
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
were if you look at the
 
03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
the the vertical line with the yellow
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
bar on it uh in that 20-year period
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
there were 84
 
03:09:29.910 --> 03:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
cpi adjusted computer price index
 
03:09:33.750 --> 03:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
adjusted 84 billion dollar disasters
 
03:09:35.670 --> 03:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
and the total cost to the country was
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:42.309 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
okay

03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:09:44.469 --> 03:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
in 1986
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
in 1986
 
03:09:49.590 --> 03:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
down at goddard space flight center
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
jim hansen
 
03:09:53.429 --> 03:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
after looking at the data that came from
 
03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
the mauna loa
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
observatory on the island of mauna loa
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
out in the pacific he was studying the
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
levels of carbon dioxide
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
and 350 parts per million
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
of co2 was initially
 
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
monitored that particular year
 
03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
well the ice cores somebody was talking
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
about ice cores in greenland they've
 
03:10:20.389 --> 03:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
been taking ice cores out of the ice in
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
greenland and they go down
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
a mile two miles deep into the ice
 
03:10:27.670 --> 03:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
and they can study them
 
03:10:30.389 --> 03:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
and they can figure out for a particular
 
03:10:30.399 --> 03:10:31.429 align:start position:0%
and they can figure out for a particular
year

03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
like 25 000 years ago when was our last
 
03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
last ice age
 
03:10:39.030 --> 03:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
that the greatest amount of co2 in the
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
atmosphere at that time was 300 parts
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
per million and now we're at 400 and
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say close to 20 i'm not
 
03:10:47.520 --> 03:10:49.349 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say close to 20 i'm not
sure

03:10:49.349 --> 03:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
so 350 in 1986 which is in this 20-year
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
time period
 
03:10:57.429 --> 03:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
okay so what we have is a situation
 
03:10:59.910 --> 03:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
where if you look at the second data
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
table below that
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
which is just the last five years
 
03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:05.670 align:start position:0%
which is just the last five years
from

03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
2017 to 2021
 
03:11:11.190 --> 03:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
the total number of disasters roughly
 
03:11:14.070 --> 03:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
the same but a five-year period as
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to a 20-year period there were
 
03:11:19.590 --> 03:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
86 billion dollar disasters in the in
 
03:11:21.190 --> 03:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
at a cost of roughly 742
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
03:11:29.429 --> 03:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
so the cost of having
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
this disruption
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
to our climate and to our earth and to
 
03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
our social system
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
is ever increasing on our society i'm
 
03:11:41.429 --> 03:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
not even talking about the 10 plus
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
billion or trillion dollars that we've
 
03:11:47.110 --> 03:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
spent on covet over the last three years
 
03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:47.990 align:start position:0%
spent on covet over the last three years
right

03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
so we're talking here about disasters
 
03:11:52.150 --> 03:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
that we see
 
03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
and and you would really have to be
 
03:11:54.239 --> 03:11:55.510 align:start position:0%
and and you would really have to be
somewhat

03:11:55.510 --> 03:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
out of it not to notice that when we
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
have rain events we don't just have rain
 
03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
anymore we have deluges
 
03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
when we have wind events we don't just
 
03:12:04.720 --> 03:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
when we have wind events we don't just
have

03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:12:07.990 --> 03:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
breezes we have wind
 
03:12:10.309 --> 03:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
right we have wind
 
03:12:12.870 --> 03:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
now that wind can be used offshore to
 
03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
generate electricity which could reduce
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of co2 in the atmosphere
 
03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
we need to seriously think about what
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
the cost is to our society
 
03:12:27.429 --> 03:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
by an ever increasing dependence on
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
when i was born in 1948
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
there were only 2 billion people on this
 
03:12:35.920 --> 03:12:37.670 align:start position:0%
there were only 2 billion people on this
planet

03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
planet
 
03:12:39.190 --> 03:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
2 billion
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
today we're approaching 8 billion
 
03:12:44.469 --> 03:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
and all of them
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
want to live like we have lived here in
 
03:12:50.790 --> 03:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
the united states for the last 70 years
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
we have lived as kings and queens
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
we have lived the life that no one could
 
03:12:59.190 --> 03:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
have imagined
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
growing up in the depression like my mom
 
03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:02.710 align:start position:0%
growing up in the depression like my mom
did

03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
we we need to think about what we can do
 
03:13:08.790 --> 03:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
to preserve this planet
 
03:13:11.429 --> 03:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
for my children your children our
 
03:13:14.710 --> 03:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
grandchildren into the future
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so i would really like to think that
 
03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
you would want to consider them
 
03:13:20.479 --> 03:13:21.269 align:start position:0%
you would want to consider them
in

03:13:21.269 --> 03:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
not supporting
 
03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
this resolution
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony
 
03:13:28.950 --> 03:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i will take questions do you have
 
03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
just just this okay okay that's right
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
you did get this right i didn't write
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
down what i just said you no no i just
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the testimony you got
 
03:13:41.030 --> 03:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh but anyways uh would you take
 
03:13:42.790 --> 03:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions of course thank you any
 
03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:45.429 align:start position:0%
questions of course thank you any
questions

03:13:45.429 --> 03:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative branch
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
you brought up a thank you uh for coming
 
03:13:53.030 --> 03:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
to testify today uh you brought up uh
 
03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
renewables and wind power
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
do you believe that uh renewables and
 
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral uh power sources such as
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
nuclear wind solar could make up for the
 
03:14:06.070 --> 03:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh loss in electricity production uh
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
from fossil fuels oh i certainly do
 
03:14:09.750 --> 03:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
i mean they the
 
03:14:13.990 --> 03:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
the offshore wind program for the gulf
 
03:14:16.870 --> 03:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
of maine stands to create an enormous
 
03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
amount of electricity we are we are so
 
03:14:23.030 --> 03:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
far behind in that kind of of electrical
 
03:14:25.269 --> 03:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
generation compared to european
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
countries and and even china that we
 
03:14:30.229 --> 03:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
need to think seriously about ways to
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
catch up
 
03:14:34.150 --> 03:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
and that's an ideal way to catch up
 
03:14:34.160 --> 03:14:35.110 align:start position:0%
and that's an ideal way to catch up
when

03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
a question uh when we tax do this carbon
 
03:14:39.910 --> 03:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
tax i mean i'm i don't know where the
 
03:14:41.190 --> 03:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
money goes what but i'm pretty
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
interested now i'm gonna have to dig
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
into this a little more
 
03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
educate me
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
when we when they pay their carbon taxes
 
03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
like their carbon go away or what what
 
03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:52.550 align:start position:0%
like their carbon go away or what what
happens

03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
happens
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry sir what i'm trying to figure
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
out in my mind
 
03:14:59.590 --> 03:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
when we charge a business
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
a carbon tax
 
03:15:04.150 --> 03:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
what happens after that does that like
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
the carbon go away or does uh or we just
 
03:15:08.950 --> 03:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
keep taking their money
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
well do you mean is the carbon
 
03:15:12.389 --> 03:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
diminishing in the atmosphere yeah
 
03:15:13.990 --> 03:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
because we're taking their money i mean
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
where what happens then do they have to
 
03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
like invest in something that cleans
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh i mean well if you reduce the amount
 
03:15:24.710 --> 03:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
of carbon dioxide being generated by
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels my question is how real
 
03:15:29.190 --> 03:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
quick if i may instead
 
03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
how do you reduce it once you take their
 
03:15:31.279 --> 03:15:32.550 align:start position:0%
how do you reduce it once you take their
money

03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
how well you're not what you're doing is
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
you're trying to push the economy
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
towards more renewable sources of
 
03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
electrical generation like offshore wind
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
so we take their money just to push them
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
to basically to
 
03:15:51.269 --> 03:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
it motivates them right they know how to
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
do this right the
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
the industries know how to generate
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
electricity using offshore wind but they
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to necessarily do it because
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
right now there's no
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
monetary incentive to do that
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
but by passing and utilizing a carbon
 
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
type tax and it's only a tax in the
 
03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
sense that
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
the people pay it initially but then
 
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
they get it back
 
03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
they get the money back it's returned
 
03:16:22.389 --> 03:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
back to the to the the stakeholders the
 
03:16:25.349 --> 03:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
the the consumers if you will
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
if i may uh if you can real quick
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
because i know scientists they can go on
 
03:16:31.990 --> 03:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
and on no disrespect but i
 
03:16:35.190 --> 03:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
i because we our science and technology
 
03:16:37.990 --> 03:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
committee when they can really educate
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
us in but it takes a while for slow
 
03:16:43.590 --> 03:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
people uh like myself
 
03:16:45.670 --> 03:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to get educated i'm still
 
03:16:45.680 --> 03:16:47.190 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to get educated i'm still
confused

03:16:47.190 --> 03:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
confused
 
03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
i mean so why we keep carbon tag this is
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
where i'm getting at
 
03:16:57.190 --> 03:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
why i'm leaning to support this here is
 
03:16:57.200 --> 03:16:59.110 align:start position:0%
why i'm leaning to support this here is
because

03:16:59.110 --> 03:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
i have elderly and i have um you know in
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
my district at a complaint that are
 
03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:04.710 align:start position:0%
my district at a complaint that are
suffering

03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
you know i mean with the electric bills
 
03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
and stuff i got people on oxygen that
 
03:17:10.229 --> 03:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
are paying more money
 
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
but yet we're gonna
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
put this carbon tax and we're raising
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity
 
03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's hurting people
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's helped me out to understand what
 
03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
that's helped me out to understand what
this

03:17:23.910 --> 03:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:17:23.920 --> 03:17:24.830 align:start position:0%
this
you

03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
know the only thing that i can say
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
relative to that is that the way that
 
03:17:33.110 --> 03:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
the plan is designed and i'm not sure
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
catherine or john are you going to
 
03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
testify in regard to this
 
03:17:38.790 --> 03:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
i might want to defer
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
your question to me
 
03:17:43.510 --> 03:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
to either john gage or his wonderful
 
03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
daughter catherine back there she's one
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the children that i'm advocating for
 
03:17:51.990 --> 03:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
with clean energy with renewable energy
 
03:17:53.910 --> 03:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
so they they might be able to better
 
03:17:56.229 --> 03:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
answer you that question okay but um
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much without any other
 
03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
questions then uh
 
03:18:07.349 --> 03:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
that i do not know i would like to think
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
probably 30 years
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
i would like to think that that would be
 
03:18:17.910 --> 03:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh which is kind of what a nuclear power
 
03:18:17.920 --> 03:18:18.870 align:start position:0%
uh which is kind of what a nuclear power
plant

03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
plant
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
without some retrofit is designed to
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
last 30 years
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
and i am i am definitely in favor of
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know i know there was a lot of huff
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
and puff about seabrook many years ago
 
03:18:32.710 --> 03:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
but there are ways of doing nuclear
 
03:18:32.720 --> 03:18:33.750 align:start position:0%
but there are ways of doing nuclear
energy

03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
that may that may result in a
 
03:18:37.750 --> 03:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount of
 
03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:38.790 align:start position:0%
significant amount of
less

03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:39.910 align:start position:0%
less
polluting

03:18:39.910 --> 03:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
polluting
 
03:18:43.110 --> 03:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh electrical generation today than what
 
03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
we are seeing now with seabrook okay
 
03:18:46.790 --> 03:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:55.510 --> 03:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
probably the same thing that we do with
 
03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
the old automobiles you know we we would
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
recycle the metals
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of very very
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
valuable materials and those and the
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
windmills themselves
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much sir for your
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you folks if you want to
 
03:19:13.510 --> 03:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
see what they do with those uh windmills
 
03:19:15.110 --> 03:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
here take a ride out to yucca valley
 
03:19:17.190 --> 03:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
where i used to go train in the desert
 
03:19:19.349 --> 03:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
hundreds of them all rusted out and just
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
sitting there they look beautiful
 
03:19:21.600 --> 03:19:22.389 align:start position:0%
sitting there they look beautiful
so

03:19:22.389 --> 03:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of that sheet too by the
 
03:19:25.590 --> 03:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
way there's a little point of
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
information about the amount of fema
 
03:19:29.670 --> 03:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
money that new hampshire has taken over
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
two different intervals and that's gone
 
03:19:33.670 --> 03:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
up significantly
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years thank you
 
03:19:39.030 --> 03:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to invite uh john gage
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
and welcome to the committee and he
 
03:19:43.269 --> 03:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill and i'm going to ask
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
the the next few speakers because we're
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
running out of time and i want my
 
03:19:49.750 --> 03:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
representatives to go to lunch but um if
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's anything
 
03:19:53.429 --> 03:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
that you've already heard that's been
 
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
spoken we
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
please don't be repetitious we want to
 
03:19:58.469 --> 03:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
hear new
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh some new uh testimony
 
03:20:20.389 --> 03:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:23.110 --> 03:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
now john are you a scientist
 
03:20:23.120 --> 03:20:24.150 align:start position:0%
now john are you a scientist
no

03:20:24.150 --> 03:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:20:25.910 --> 03:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'm an amateur scientist i have a
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
biology degree from college but instead
 
03:20:31.590 --> 03:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
of watching professional sports on tv i
 
03:20:33.910 --> 03:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
read science books for fun so
 
03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm an artist it's hard for me to
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
hear with that mask can you put the mic
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
down some yeah sure
 
03:20:40.319 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
down some yeah sure
oops

03:20:42.720 --> 03:20:42.730 align:start position:0%
oops
 
03:20:42.730 --> 03:20:54.790 align:start position:0%
oops
[Music]

03:20:54.790 --> 03:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
i'm submitting that as information
 
03:21:07.190 --> 03:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
um i will i tried to submit my written
 
03:21:07.200 --> 03:21:08.870 align:start position:0%
um i will i tried to submit my written
testimony

03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:21:11.190 --> 03:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
after i had registered my opposition to
 
03:21:11.200 --> 03:21:12.790 align:start position:0%
after i had registered my opposition to
this

03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:21:15.269 --> 03:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
resolution and it didn't let me so i
 
03:21:16.229 --> 03:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if
 
03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
i couldn't do it again it gave me an
 
03:21:19.830 --> 03:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
error that i'd already registered my
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
position so
 
03:21:22.309 --> 03:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
i either have to send my written
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
testimony to you or some get it to you
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:36.309 --> 03:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:39.190 --> 03:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so if that's what i said before i
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
heard the first two speakers i added
 
03:21:43.110 --> 03:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
about 10 more minutes to what i could
 
03:21:43.120 --> 03:21:44.229 align:start position:0%
about 10 more minutes to what i could
say

03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:21:45.429 --> 03:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
but it's up to you how much time you
 
03:21:46.550 --> 03:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
want to spend
 
03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:47.349 align:start position:0%
want to spend
um

03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:47.359 --> 03:21:48.710 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
my background is in computer science but
 
03:21:53.429 --> 03:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
i as i said i i love to read science and
 
03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
i started off reading biology and
 
03:21:57.110 --> 03:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
chemistry and physics and astronomy and
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
about seven years ago i shifted to
 
03:22:00.309 --> 03:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
climate science
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
just for fun
 
03:22:03.750 --> 03:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
i have worked in a biology lab so i knew
 
03:22:06.870 --> 03:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
how to read research i know how to
 
03:22:09.750 --> 03:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
identify reputable sources
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
and evaluate
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
information from multiple sources so
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
what you have right there is the fourth
 
03:22:17.110 --> 03:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
national climate assessment the
 
03:22:19.750 --> 03:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
executive summary from volume one and
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
the overview from volume 2.
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
this is produced by law
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
by the united states global change
 
03:22:29.030 --> 03:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
research program
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of climate scientists
 
03:22:33.670 --> 03:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
and other scientists from across a wide

it's reviewed by the national academy of

03:22:45.510 --> 03:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
sciences
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of this is to do a
 
03:22:49.510 --> 03:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
survey of what we know about global
 
03:22:53.349 --> 03:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:55.750 --> 03:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
write it down and produce a report that
 
03:22:57.510 --> 03:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be used by
 
03:22:59.750 --> 03:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative side of government to
 
03:23:02.309 --> 03:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
make decisions about what we should do
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
about our climate pollution
 
03:23:04.800 --> 03:23:05.670 align:start position:0%
about our climate pollution
so

03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative notter mentioned somebody
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
might come up
 
03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
and talk about the heartland institute
 
03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
and talk about the heartland institute
because

03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
i have seen her handing out copies of a
 
03:23:18.150 --> 03:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
booklet called why science
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
to disagree about global warming
 
03:23:24.229 --> 03:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
there is a bunch of shadow organizations
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
that are funded by the fossil fuel
 
03:23:26.239 --> 03:23:27.349 align:start position:0%
that are funded by the fossil fuel
industry

03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:23:30.630 --> 03:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
koch brothers exxon others to produce
 
03:23:30.640 --> 03:23:33.030 align:start position:0%
koch brothers exxon others to produce
misinformation

03:23:33.030 --> 03:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
they take a
 
03:23:36.309 --> 03:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
a bit of science
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
and then they exclude a bunch of other
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
science and they
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
produce documents that
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
try to convince you that the science is
 
03:23:47.110 --> 03:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
not science
 
03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
but they're not science they're
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
propaganda so
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
propaganda is
 
03:23:54.630 --> 03:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
marketing made to influence people's
 
03:23:57.190 --> 03:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
opinions and decisions
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's not based on what we know
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
through science it's based on how to
 
03:24:03.349 --> 03:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
convince people
 
03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
that we should
 
03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
behave a certain way
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
not pass certain legislation so
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
the first volume of this is the causes
 
03:24:14.870 --> 03:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
of global warming as we know through
 
03:24:14.880 --> 03:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
of global warming as we know through
science

03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
science
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
now there's not a scientific
 
03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
organization that in the world that
 
03:24:22.870 --> 03:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
disagrees with the conclusions in here
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to read just two
 
03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:26.630 align:start position:0%
i'd like to read just two
paragraphs

03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's a nice so it's a very large
 
03:24:31.269 --> 03:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
report this is the executive summary 25
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
pages or so there's a two page
 
03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
highlights of it and i'm going to read
 
03:24:37.510 --> 03:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
you two paragraphs from the highlights
 
03:24:39.030 --> 03:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
which is two pages long what page are
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
you reading from it's page one page one
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
that way to clerk and underline it for
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
so remember this is from all of the
 
03:24:53.510 --> 03:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
science organizations
 
03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the us and they surveyed all the
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
science from around the world for the
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
last couple decades
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
and they say globally global annual
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
sorry so second paragraph on page one
 
03:25:07.830 --> 03:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
global annually average surface air
 
03:25:10.229 --> 03:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
temperature has increased by about 1.8
 
03:25:12.309 --> 03:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
degrees fahrenheit over the last 115
 
03:25:12.319 --> 03:25:13.349 align:start position:0%
degrees fahrenheit over the last 115
years

03:25:13.349 --> 03:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:25:14.950 --> 03:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
this period is now the warmest in the
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
history of modern civilization that's
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
the last 10 000 years
 
03:25:21.269 --> 03:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
the last few years have also seen
 
03:25:22.870 --> 03:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
record-breaking climate-related weather
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
extremes in the last three years have
 
03:25:26.870 --> 03:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
been the warmest years on record for the
 
03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:27.910 align:start position:0%
been the warmest years on record for the
globe

03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
globe
 
03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
these trends are expected to continue
 
03:25:32.309 --> 03:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
over climate time scales
 
03:25:34.229 --> 03:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
this assessment concludes based on
 
03:25:36.469 --> 03:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
extensive evidence that it is extremely
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
likely that human activities especially
 
03:25:40.950 --> 03:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
emissions of greenhouse gases are the
 
03:25:43.269 --> 03:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
dominant cause of the observed warming
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
since the mid 20th century
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
for the warming over the last century
 
03:25:48.550 --> 03:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
there is no convincing alternative
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
explanation supported by the extent of
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
observational evidence
 
03:25:55.990 --> 03:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
so extremely likely in scientific terms
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
means 95 to 100 percent
 
03:25:58.160 --> 03:26:00.150 align:start position:0%
means 95 to 100 percent
confidence

03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
that it's right based on all the
 
03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:02.710 align:start position:0%
that it's right based on all the
evidence

03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:03.670 align:start position:0%
evidence
so

03:26:03.670 --> 03:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:26:05.349 --> 03:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
the heartland institute will say the
 
03:26:08.070 --> 03:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
science isn't settled
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
science has never settled
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
which is true
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
we can become very confident that we
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
know something through science when the
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
evidence becomes overwhelming
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
and that's what it is about human cause
 
03:26:19.279 --> 03:26:21.910 align:start position:0%
and that's what it is about human cause
pollution

03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:23.910 --> 03:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
and global warming
 
03:26:26.550 --> 03:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay the volume 2 was about the impacts
 
03:26:29.349 --> 03:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
of the problem
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
but i want to talk to you directly about
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
what you asked
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
why carbon tax how does putting a price
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
on carbon reduce emissions
 
03:26:40.229 --> 03:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier to understand how a
 
03:26:42.870 --> 03:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
regulation can reduce emissions you say
 
03:26:44.070 --> 03:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
03:26:47.110 --> 03:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
release that pollution so they don't
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh if you tell a coal produced a power
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
plant that uses coal
 
03:26:53.030 --> 03:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
that they have to reduce their emissions
 
03:26:55.190 --> 03:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
by a certain amount they produce less
 
03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
electricity or they have to install
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
something that pulls co2 out of the air
 
03:27:03.190 --> 03:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
it raises the cost of that electricity
 
03:27:04.630 --> 03:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
so you've
 
03:27:06.790 --> 03:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
you've legislated regulation
 
03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
and you've indirectly affected the cost
 
03:27:11.590 --> 03:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
that cost
 
03:27:15.030 --> 03:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
it goes into producing electricity the
 
03:27:16.950 --> 03:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
consumers of that electricity pay higher
 
03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:18.550 align:start position:0%
consumers of that electricity pay higher
costs

03:27:18.550 --> 03:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why people don't like
 
03:27:23.110 --> 03:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
regulations it increases costs
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
you can also use subsidies and
 
03:27:24.479 --> 03:27:26.150 align:start position:0%
you can also use subsidies and
incentives

03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
03:27:27.190 --> 03:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
we can
 
03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
help people buy electric cars
 
03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
give them a tax break
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
that helps the people that buy the
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
electric cars which
 
03:27:35.670 --> 03:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
is kind of a regressive thing because
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's more the wealthy
 
03:27:38.950 --> 03:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
people that are able to buy a more
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
expensive car get some tax help and they
 
03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
get get electric cars
 
03:27:47.110 --> 03:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
so the the reason we want to do that is
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
that they then produce less pollution
 
03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
which is good for everybody they also
 
03:27:53.349 --> 03:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
expand the market for electric vehicles
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
which over time makes them cheaper for
 
03:27:58.229 --> 03:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
everybody but that's also a regressive
 
03:27:58.239 --> 03:28:00.469 align:start position:0%
everybody but that's also a regressive
policy

03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
and it's one particular thing we've got
 
03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of pollution from everywhere
 
03:28:07.190 --> 03:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
a vehicle transportation is 40 of us
 
03:28:08.469 --> 03:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
emissions but it's
 
03:28:10.389 --> 03:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
less than half
 
03:28:12.950 --> 03:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
then there's a carbon price
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
let me talk about a really good design
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
for a carbon
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
carbon price a carbon tax
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's three parts
 
03:28:25.030 --> 03:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
and they work like the legs of a stool
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
the first is a steadily rising fee
 
03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
on the production of fossil fuels based
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
on the carbon emissions
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
paid by the fossil fuel producers so
 
03:28:38.070 --> 03:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
when they sell coal oil and natural gas
 
03:28:39.590 --> 03:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
into the economy
 
03:28:42.150 --> 03:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
they pay another line item on tax to the
 
03:28:42.160 --> 03:28:43.269 align:start position:0%
they pay another line item on tax to the
irs

03:28:43.269 --> 03:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
irs
 
03:28:45.910 --> 03:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
for the carbon content of their fuels
 
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
we start
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
there's a bill in congress to do this
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
called the energy innovation act which
 
03:28:54.630 --> 03:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
would start at 15 per ton of co2 emitted
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
from the fuels and rising by ten dollars
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
more a year so it'll reach about a
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
03:29:02.790 --> 03:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
in about 10 years wrap it up please uh
 
03:29:04.150 --> 03:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
because you're four minutes away over
 
03:29:04.160 --> 03:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
because you're four minutes away over
but

03:29:04.950 --> 03:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
the second part
 
03:29:10.229 --> 03:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
the second part is the dividend
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
all the money that's collected
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
is rebated back to all american
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
households on an equal per capita basis
 
03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:19.269 align:start position:0%
households on an equal per capita basis
so

03:29:19.269 --> 03:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
we will start paying trickle down higher
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
if all the money that's collected is put
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
into a carbon trust and rebated back to
 
03:29:31.429 --> 03:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
households on an equal basis one share
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
per adult a half a share per child most
 
03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
people will come out ahead
 
03:29:37.990 --> 03:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
most people especially low income and
 
03:29:40.150 --> 03:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
middle income households will receive
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
more money in their carbon rebate
 
03:29:46.389 --> 03:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
than they pay in higher prices total
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
this helps low-income households affect
 
03:29:50.790 --> 03:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
higher energy prices it doesn't hurt
 
03:29:50.800 --> 03:29:51.990 align:start position:0%
higher energy prices it doesn't hurt
them

03:29:51.990 --> 03:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:29:55.750 --> 03:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
we advocate for carbon fee and dividend
 
03:29:58.710 --> 03:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
but that's a carbon tax according to
 
03:30:00.389 --> 03:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know legislation
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
even though it's not raising revenue for
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
government spending all the money is
 
03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
going back to households
 
03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
like this resolution you're saying we
 
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't want carbon fee and dividend
 
03:30:13.830 --> 03:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
the third thing that this stool needs is
 
03:30:17.190 --> 03:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
to protect u.s manufacturers and
 
03:30:17.200 --> 03:30:19.269 align:start position:0%
to protect u.s manufacturers and
to

03:30:19.269 --> 03:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
hold other countries accountable for
 
03:30:22.389 --> 03:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
their pollution
 
03:30:23.750 --> 03:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
how do we do that
 
03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
with border adjustments as
 
03:30:27.269 --> 03:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
one of your previous immigrants you can
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
wrap it up because i'm trying to out of
 
03:30:31.349 --> 03:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
respect for my committee because uh
 
03:30:32.950 --> 03:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise i don't want to recess there
 
03:30:34.790 --> 03:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
and put it to the end of the day that's
 
03:30:36.950 --> 03:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
why i want to give respect that you all
 
03:30:39.190 --> 03:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
came here oh sure because i have another
 
03:30:40.710 --> 03:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
hearing at one o'clock and i want them
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
to eat lunch
 
03:30:41.920 --> 03:30:42.710 align:start position:0%
to eat lunch
okay

03:30:42.710 --> 03:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
i teach a class to high school students
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
called help solve climate change it
 
03:30:49.349 --> 03:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
covers the science economics policies
 
03:30:51.910 --> 03:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
and politics of global warming
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and it teaches them to advocate for
 
03:30:55.349 --> 03:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
effective and equitable climate
 
03:30:55.359 --> 03:30:56.469 align:start position:0%
effective and equitable climate
solutions

03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
03:30:59.910 --> 03:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
carbon fee fian dividend is the most
 
03:30:59.920 --> 03:31:01.110 align:start position:0%
carbon fee fian dividend is the most
powerful

03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
powerful
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
effective and equitable
 
03:31:06.150 --> 03:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
policy we have
 
03:31:08.150 --> 03:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
as part of that in new hampshire
 
03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
we did a carbon cash back coalition
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
project and put a warrant article in 44
 
03:31:15.750 --> 03:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
towns town meetings in the last two
 
03:31:15.760 --> 03:31:17.110 align:start position:0%
towns town meetings in the last two
years

03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:31:19.510 --> 03:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
33 of those towns voted to ask their
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
state and federal legislators to pass
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
carbon infinitive and legislation
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
including londonderry
 
03:31:27.750 --> 03:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned that your voters
 
03:31:30.389 --> 03:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
in londonderry wouldn't like this
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
but if you explain simply that
 
03:31:34.469 --> 03:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
if we put a price on pollution
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
we'll get less of it through efficient
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
market forces
 
03:31:38.710 --> 03:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
if we rebate the money back to
 
03:31:40.710 --> 03:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
households we have a revenue neutral
 
03:31:43.750 --> 03:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
policy it's not a tax and in fact most
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
people come out ahead
 
03:31:46.950 --> 03:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
and it's the only way that we can use
 
03:31:48.389 --> 03:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
border adjustments
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
to hold other countries accountable for
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
their pollution if you say we're not
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to do a carbon tax you're saying
 
03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're taking away our tools
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your testimony i
 
03:32:00.070 --> 03:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
i can tell you right now while you were
 
03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
speaking i brought up my solar usage
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
because i fell into the trap
 
03:32:06.630 --> 03:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
and i bought i had 30 panels on my house
 
03:32:09.030 --> 03:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
thinking it was going to save the day
 
03:32:11.190 --> 03:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
like today i'm very low because of
 
03:32:14.150 --> 03:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
cloudy day but i i during winter months
 
03:32:15.990 --> 03:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
and other you know cloudy days and rainy
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
days i produce nothing very limited
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
but i
 
03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
got sucked in on it and they think it
 
03:32:23.590 --> 03:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
was the best deal in the world and i've
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
got these big panels on my roof which
 
03:32:27.750 --> 03:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
does save me money
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
but i gotta wait for the sun to come out
 
03:32:31.510 --> 03:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm saying so i thought i'd throw
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
that out there on uh on my feelings
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
on this green energy there that i
 
03:32:38.309 --> 03:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
thought was the best thing since peanut
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
butter and i feel like i got used well
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between subsidies
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
and letting the market figure it out i
 
03:32:45.269 --> 03:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
didn't get the subsidy the company that
 
03:32:47.349 --> 03:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
put them in took the subsidy i was more
 
03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
looking to save money for my family as
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who lives on a budget
 
03:32:54.389 --> 03:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
so if we have carbon fee and dividend
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
you'll actually come out ahead you will
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
end up with uh more money each month in
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
your carbon dividend
 
03:33:02.389 --> 03:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
yet in seven years
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
but thank you anyways well it's
 
03:33:05.349 --> 03:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
happening in canada they're doing it
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
there right
 
03:33:09.670 --> 03:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
we live in new hampshire this bill is
 
03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
interested in the state of new hampshire
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
the people who live here not next door
 
03:33:16.229 --> 03:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts anywhere else we're
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about new hampshire well the
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
resolution says we want our state and
 
03:33:22.469 --> 03:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
federal governments to not carbon tax
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
and what i'm saying is what we need is a
 
03:33:24.399 --> 03:33:25.269 align:start position:0%
and what i'm saying is what we need is a
federal

03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
carbon fee and dividend with border
 
03:33:26.560 --> 03:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
carbon fee and dividend with border
adjustments

03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
03:33:30.070 --> 03:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
so the resolution it doesn't say just
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
state the resolution also says federal
 
03:33:32.239 --> 03:33:33.190 align:start position:0%
state the resolution also says federal
which

03:33:33.190 --> 03:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:33:35.349 --> 03:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
according to the experts is
 
03:33:37.830 --> 03:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
our best first step to reduce pollution
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
around the world in a way that protects
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
family budgets and helps u.s
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers be even more competitive
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
in a global marketplace well i thank you
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony and uh
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead representative chase
 
03:33:58.469 --> 03:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i i decided to save my
 
03:34:00.070 --> 03:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
question for you know because i knew you
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
had something you'd send calls and send
 
03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
emails to the committee well thank you
 
03:34:05.190 --> 03:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman for let me ask thank you for
 
03:34:07.830 --> 03:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony today so um
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
you know obviously
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
a big reason why people want a carbon
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
tax and a big reason you know why so
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
many people came here today was um that
 
03:34:17.429 --> 03:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
they want to see less
 
03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
carbon-based energy being used in our in
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
our economy and on our energy grid but
 
03:34:23.830 --> 03:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
um however
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm a little confused and if
 
03:34:27.990 --> 03:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
you could just briefly briefly explain
 
03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:28.790 align:start position:0%
you could just briefly briefly explain
um

03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:30.389 --> 03:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
the reality is we can't to my
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
understanding and we can't fully move
 
03:34:35.830 --> 03:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
our entire energy grid to be carbon
 
03:34:38.710 --> 03:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
neutral or carbon to zeroed out because
 
03:34:40.710 --> 03:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of these energy sources like solar
 
03:34:42.229 --> 03:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
and like wind right they're very
 
03:34:43.990 --> 03:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
dependent on natural and you know what
 
03:34:45.990 --> 03:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
the climate is right what the weather is
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
of the day and even things like nuclear
 
03:34:49.830 --> 03:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of energy to get the
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
plant going and the energy is pretty you
 
03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
know it stays stagnant at a current
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
level right to deal with the troughs
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
that happen throughout the day or even
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
based on months of the year you need to
 
03:35:01.670 --> 03:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
be able to you know increase energy or
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
decrease the amount of energy and the
 
03:35:05.590 --> 03:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
only fuel source the only kind of energy
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
source that can do that is coal natural
 
03:35:10.469 --> 03:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
gas and oil right you can control it's
 
03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
very easy for a coal plant to control
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of energy that you're putting
 
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
into the grid or to decrease the amount
 
03:35:17.670 --> 03:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
of energy you can't really do that
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
specifically with renewables like solar
 
03:35:20.239 --> 03:35:21.429 align:start position:0%
specifically with renewables like solar
and

03:35:21.429 --> 03:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
solar and wind it's very dependent on
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
the weather and with nuclear it's
 
03:35:27.349 --> 03:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
completely stagnant right once you get
 
03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
the plant up that's it so my i'm trying
 
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm confused like
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
do you really think that a carbon tax
 
03:35:35.429 --> 03:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
could completely make our entire grid
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral because i just don't see
 
03:35:39.269 --> 03:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
it in any way being possible yes i do i
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
think it's the only way we can make it
 
03:35:40.720 --> 03:35:43.030 align:start position:0%
think it's the only way we can make it
happen

03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:35:45.269 --> 03:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you well thank you because
 
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
can i respond yeah real quick please if
 
03:35:49.990 --> 03:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
you're right well
 
03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
if we had started carbon fee and devon
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
in 30 years ago we would have all the
 
03:35:55.349 --> 03:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
solutions that you're saying we don't
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
have right now
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
we have a market failure
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
when you have a market failure the
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
market doesn't produce all the things
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
you need to get the maximum benefit
 
03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
the market fails to account for the
 
03:36:07.830 --> 03:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
costs of using fossil fuels in their
 
03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:08.790 align:start position:0%
costs of using fossil fuels in their
price

03:36:08.790 --> 03:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
price
 
03:36:10.630 --> 03:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
the the pollution that comes out of
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels is free
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
and economists say
 
03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
in order to correct the market failure
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
you can do policies lots of different
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
policies but the most
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
direct way to affect this market failure
 
03:36:25.110 --> 03:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
to wrap it up is to put the price of
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
pollution into the cost of fossil fuels
 
03:36:27.359 --> 03:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
pollution into the cost of fossil fuels
so

03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah nuclear uh takes a long time to
 
03:36:33.670 --> 03:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
ramp up and ramp down but when you're
 
03:36:35.269 --> 03:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
not using electricity you can generate
 
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
hydrogen you can split water with the
 
03:36:39.269 --> 03:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
extra electricity that you're using and
 
03:36:41.110 --> 03:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
then you can use that later when you
 
03:36:42.550 --> 03:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
want electricity
 
03:36:43.510 --> 03:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
more than what you're getting from
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear we need to get the market
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
solving a lot of these problems in a lot
 
03:36:50.790 --> 03:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
of different ways and that's why carbon
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
price is a better solution than any of
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
the specific
 
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
chipping away at the edges i'm trying to
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
give as much leeway as i can out of
 
03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
respect because you took the time to
 
03:37:02.309 --> 03:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
come in but i'm asking you you know
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
because otherwise i don't want to have
 
03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:04.790 align:start position:0%
because otherwise i don't want to have
to

03:37:04.790 --> 03:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:37:06.550 --> 03:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
recess this committee
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
and then come back this afternoon for it
 
03:37:10.150 --> 03:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
and have you sitting all day that's why
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to push you
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't have to do that you know what
 
03:37:14.469 --> 03:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
i'm saying out of respect for the other
 
03:37:14.479 --> 03:37:16.070 align:start position:0%
i'm saying out of respect for the other
speakers

03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
03:37:18.070 --> 03:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your testimony and
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you for your time i
 
03:37:21.429 --> 03:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
have to let my committee lunch that's
 
03:37:21.439 --> 03:37:23.990 align:start position:0%
have to let my committee lunch that's
why

03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:25.349 --> 03:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
three minutes uh opposes the bill
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
if it's repetitious on what was already
 
03:37:38.309 --> 03:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
said we appreciate if there's anything
 
03:37:40.630 --> 03:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
new oh thank you so much for hearing
 
03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
that how old you by the way 18 18 god
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
bless you we we like when we see the
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
young people involved oh thank you so
 
03:37:49.349 --> 03:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
much for listening to me and i want to
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you is it your dad
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes i was made i want to thank him
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
because you know i'm going to look to
 
03:37:56.790 --> 03:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
these here because i'm in i'm in the
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
learning process this should have went
 
03:38:00.630 --> 03:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
to the state and you know to engine i
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
mean um science and technology
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know because they're the duty
 
03:38:07.110 --> 03:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
experts but i'm we're trying to deal
 
03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
with it here in my committee
 
03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
um so i oppose hr17 because i think a
 
03:38:18.309 --> 03:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
federal carbon fian dividend with border
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
carbon adjustments which is of the
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
three-part carbon price done correctly
 
03:38:26.469 --> 03:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
is really necessary um for our safety
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
and it will also really help the people
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
and the economy because with the
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
dividend coming back 85 percent of all
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
households or and 99
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
of the lowest of the poorest households
 
03:38:41.349 --> 03:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
will either come out ahead or break even
 
03:38:43.110 --> 03:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
under this policy they'll be getting
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
more money in their dividend that
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
they'll be paying at higher prices due
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
to the carbon fee and meanwhile this
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
policy is getting us 90 percent of the
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
way to net zero by 2050 and there's a
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill in congress
 
03:38:59.750 --> 03:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
called the energy innovation act that's
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing done well
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:04.870 align:start position:0%
and um
another

03:39:04.870 --> 03:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
problem we would have with opposing
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing at the federal level is
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
that border carbon adjustments can be
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
used by other countries that have carbon
 
03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
prices and they can put border carbon
 
03:39:17.830 --> 03:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
adjustments on us so that when we trade
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
with them we have to pay them money
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a carbon tax so we
 
03:39:24.710 --> 03:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay the carbon tax to them if we
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a carbon tax here in the u.s
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
so for example the eu is going to start
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
doing this on us in 2026
 
03:39:35.189 --> 03:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
and canada and the uk are also talking
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
about it so
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
if they're having a carbon tax if we
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a government tax we'll be
 
03:39:43.990 --> 03:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
paying money for our carbon to other
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
countries whereas if we have a carbon
 
03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
tax in the us we'll be able to keep that
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
money here in our economy and give it
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
back to citizens
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that's why
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of citizens support it and i hope
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
you'll consider opposing this resolution
 
03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
because it
 
03:40:02.469 --> 03:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
limits our options especially at the
 
03:40:04.870 --> 03:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
federal level well thank you they're
 
03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
very impressive on your testimony i
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh do you have written
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
testimony i submitted something online
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
um representative moffatt
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr i'm supposed to ask a
 
03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
question so my question is did you know
 
03:40:21.349 --> 03:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
that i read your concord monitor piece
 
03:40:22.950 --> 03:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday and that i thought it was very
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
well put together oh thank you and i did
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
speak with your dad on the phone last
 
03:40:29.590 --> 03:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
night and i we're out of time and i
 
03:40:31.349 --> 03:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
there are a lot a lot a lot of pieces to
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
this i wish we had time to get into but
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
we will have an executive session
 
03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
scheduled on this at some point and
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
within this committee we will
 
03:40:41.429 --> 03:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
be able to talk about some of the things
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we just don't have time for now and
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it's it'll be on youtube so
 
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
you may i think you'd be interested to
 
03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
tune into that i'm going to give a
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
little leeway so if you've got some
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
questions for please ask her because 18
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
year olds will come in here and get
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
involved i owe them i owe her that
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you miss chair i will ask
 
03:41:00.550 --> 03:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
when i i was going to ask your dad but i
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
know we have some time constraints but
 
03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
global warming used to be the term that
 
03:41:07.510 --> 03:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot about and it kind of
 
03:41:10.630 --> 03:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
morphed into climate change because
 
03:41:11.670 --> 03:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
there was
 
03:41:13.830 --> 03:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
questions and data that maybe global
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
warming is not happening there's a
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
spectrum of
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
did you know that 7 800 years ago
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
greenland which
 
03:41:26.429 --> 03:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
eventually became a big ice sheet
 
03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
800 years ago there were many
 
03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
settlements on greenland which indicated
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
that the world clearly was much warmer
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
then than it is now or since then
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
because obviously you get cold and those
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
those settlements went away from
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
greenland did did you know that did you
 
03:41:45.510 --> 03:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on that
 
03:41:49.510 --> 03:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
800 years ago 800 900 years ago many
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
southern greenland viking
 
03:41:51.439 --> 03:41:53.429 align:start position:0%
southern greenland viking
settlements

03:41:53.429 --> 03:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
settlements
 
03:41:56.150 --> 03:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's all my family the vikings
 
03:41:58.229 --> 03:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't know much about that
 
03:42:00.309 --> 03:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
i just know that the world set up as we
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
have it now like for example with all
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
the people living on coasts it's not
 
03:42:04.560 --> 03:42:05.910 align:start position:0%
the people living on coasts it's not
really

03:42:05.910 --> 03:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:42:08.070 --> 03:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
gonna be sustainable to live with a
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
warmer climate and the problems that
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
will come with it
 
03:42:15.030 --> 03:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay i i kind of ambush you but that's
 
03:42:16.150 --> 03:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
something that we'll probably get into
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
an exact thank you mr chair i'm sorry
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
you're welcome i know i had some
 
03:42:23.349 --> 03:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
concerns like on my property um i have
 
03:42:25.110 --> 03:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
so many insurance companies already
 
03:42:27.110 --> 03:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
figured this out i've got a hundred year
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
flood plan and then there's a 50 flood
 
03:42:32.469 --> 03:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
plan yeah and 25 on my property you know
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
i mean because i have wetlands and
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
everything behind me so they they know
 
03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
exactly when that land flooded over many
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
years through climate or whatever to the
 
03:42:42.870 --> 03:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
shifting of the moon and sun and all
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
that other stuff so i just so you know
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
it was pretty interesting to me when i
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
bought my property
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know because whether it was in a
 
03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
flood zone or not you know in accordance
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
with the studies over the years but i
 
03:42:58.150 --> 03:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
want to thank you very much uh for
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
coming in here and i hope you tell your
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
friends there and your dad took a
 
03:43:04.229 --> 03:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
picture of you testifying
 
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know i mean for for history there
 
03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:43:09.750 --> 03:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all very
 
03:43:09.760 --> 03:43:10.950 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all very
much

03:43:10.950 --> 03:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
okay five minutes i'm hoping he can
 
03:43:16.150 --> 03:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
narrow it down to three uh walter payne
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
from exeter and he opposes the bill
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
the uh and if it's
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
something we have already heard if you
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
get anything new please bring it forward
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about the uh
 
03:43:31.269 --> 03:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
specific uh bills talk closer to mike
 
03:43:31.279 --> 03:43:32.389 align:start position:0%
specific uh bills talk closer to mike
because

03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
my hearing's bad and i'm uh overtired no
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
one's here much better because i look at
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
lips you know when you're speaking so
 
03:43:42.150 --> 03:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's why you see me looking sure
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
um so uh yes i do oppose hr 17
 
03:43:47.189 --> 03:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
but before i look at what it does say
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk a bit about what it
 
03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
does not say
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
it does not deny that the climate is
 
03:43:54.150 --> 03:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
changing it does not deny that burning
 
03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels is the main reason for that
 
03:43:58.150 --> 03:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
it does not deny that climate change is
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
already causing extreme weather that is
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
making life in america and the rest of
 
03:44:04.870 --> 03:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
the world both less safe and pleasant as
 
03:44:06.550 --> 03:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
well as more expensive
 
03:44:08.550 --> 03:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
which is a bad combination
 
03:44:10.150 --> 03:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
it does not deny that we therefore need
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
to quickly phase out fossil fuels in
 
03:44:13.830 --> 03:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
order to avoid ever larger reductions in
 
03:44:15.910 --> 03:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
our standard of living and ever greater
 
03:44:17.670 --> 03:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
expenses to protect us from extreme
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
weather and to repair the damage we
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
cannot prevent
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
indeed it implicitly acknowledges that
 
03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions are a problem wherever
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
they occur even across the globe in
 
03:44:29.910 --> 03:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
china or india which is of course true
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
ten or even five years ago such a
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
resolution might well have denied one or
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
more of these statements
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's progress
 
03:44:38.229 --> 03:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
all it's taken is an unrelenting string
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
of record floods fires heat waves
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
hurricanes and tornadoes for most
 
03:44:44.070 --> 03:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
serious people to accept that climate
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
change is real and is wreaking havoc all
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
around the earth
 
03:44:50.150 --> 03:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
some of this damage can be quantified
 
03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
destroyed homes and businesses reduce
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
crop yields and fish catches other
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
damage is impossible for price
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
lives lost natural wonders erased as
 
03:45:01.110 --> 03:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
well as smaller losses such as cool
 
03:45:02.870 --> 03:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
evening breezes in the summer
 
03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
more mosquitoes and deer ticks and fewer
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
days for kids to play in the snow or
 
03:45:08.710 --> 03:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
skate on ponds well these costs are not
 
03:45:10.710 --> 03:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
being imposed by government they're at
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
least as much a burden as attacks
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
and a steadily arising one
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
so we need to act today to avoid the
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
worst effects of climate change and
 
03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
eventually regain the benefits of a
 
03:45:21.670 --> 03:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
stable climate this is the type of
 
03:45:21.680 --> 03:45:22.630 align:start position:0%
stable climate this is the type of
problem

03:45:22.630 --> 03:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
familiar to every parent farmer business
 
03:45:27.269 --> 03:45:27.279 align:start position:0%
owner indeed anyone who wants to improve
 
03:45:27.279 --> 03:45:28.229 align:start position:0%
owner indeed anyone who wants to improve
anything

03:45:28.229 --> 03:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:45:30.150 --> 03:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
you have to sacrifice something today
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
for a better tomorrow
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
and here a better tomorrow is in
 
03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
comparison to the do-nothing default
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is continual
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
climate catastrophe
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
there are two reasons this is
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
politically difficult for climate change
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
establish a stable climate is a global
 
03:45:48.550 --> 03:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
public good it exists for all or it
 
03:45:49.990 --> 03:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
exists for none
 
03:45:51.670 --> 03:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
so any individual's action is
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
insignificant and even small countries
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
can free ride on the efforts of large
 
03:45:55.279 --> 03:45:56.710 align:start position:0%
can free ride on the efforts of large
countries

03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
countries
 
03:45:58.389 --> 03:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
the time secondly the time between
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
sacrifice and reward is much longer than
 
03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
between planting and harvesting a crop
 
03:46:05.670 --> 03:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
even while immediate action is necessary
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
the results of reducing emissions will
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
not be apparent for more than a decade
 
03:46:14.150 --> 03:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
hr 17 offers no solutions
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
it simply wants to rule out taxing
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
carbon even though that's widely
 
03:46:18.550 --> 03:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
considered the most efficient and
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
fairest way to reduce emissions
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
it objects that a carbon tax will quote
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
manipulate consumer decisions suggesting
 
03:46:27.189 --> 03:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
that the switch to renewables which of
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
course is what is needed will be a
 
03:46:31.750 --> 03:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
nefarious process rather than the stated
 
03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
goal of public policy though work its
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
way through economic incentives the way
 
03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
market economies work all over the world
 
03:46:41.429 --> 03:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
while no one wants to unnecessarily pay
 
03:46:43.590 --> 03:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
more for anything the relevant question
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
is whether fossil fuel tax an explicit
 
03:46:48.550 --> 03:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
one will cost us less
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
than the climate tax
 
03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
over the long run
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
the resolution raises two issues that
 
03:46:56.070 --> 03:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
are addressed by well-designed carbon
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
taxes and there's been a lot of talk of
 
03:46:59.349 --> 03:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
this so i'll just mention at the end of
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
that paragraph uh that more
 
03:47:03.189 --> 03:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the current price of
 
03:47:05.189 --> 03:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels does not include the cost
 
03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
of damage they they do now
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
through conventional pollution that
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
harms the health of millions of
 
03:47:12.870 --> 03:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
americans and in the future climate
 
03:47:12.880 --> 03:47:13.830 align:start position:0%
americans and in the future climate
change

03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
every time we fill up our cars we're
 
03:47:18.150 --> 03:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
getting an artificial bargain at the
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
expense of future generations
 
03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
a carbon tax will shift energy-intensive
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturing this was also mentioned
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
without reducing global emissions this
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
is of course the global public good
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
problem problem that's dealt with the
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
border carbon adjustment
 
03:47:35.189 --> 03:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
whether this resolution passes or fails
 
03:47:37.110 --> 03:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
will not alter the atmosphere by one
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
molecule of co2 but it sends a bad
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
message by trying to score political
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
points when we need to begin working
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
together to solve the greatest challenge
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
in human history and one that has no
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
political affiliation
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
most of us are not going to be around to
 
03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
pay the climate tax by the time becomes
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
prohibitively high
 
03:47:56.550 --> 03:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
see a couple of people here but not too
 
03:47:56.560 --> 03:47:59.269 align:start position:0%
see a couple of people here but not too
many

03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
but our children and grandchildren will
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
be along with everyone else who comes
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
after us for centuries to come even
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
though they will have played no role in
 
03:48:09.349 --> 03:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
creating or ignoring the problem
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
an intergenerational form of taxation
 
03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
without representation
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
if your child wasn't feeling well and a
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
doctor discovered a tumor would you
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
ignore it hoping that you might not be
 
03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
around the time serious harm can you
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
hold one second i apologize sure if any
 
03:48:25.110 --> 03:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
member here wants to go grab a sandwich
 
03:48:27.269 --> 03:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
before one o'clock
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
okay because
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
apparently they don't it just keeps
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
going uh please go get something to eat
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh because i know some have
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
have to eat or drink so i'm out of
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
respect for my members here
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay so just get up and go to the
 
03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
cafeteria grab something quick for one
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
o'clock thank you okay go ahead yeah
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
sure so um if your child wasn't feeling
 
03:48:50.469 --> 03:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
well and a doctor discovered a tumor
 
03:48:51.990 --> 03:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
would you ignore it hoping that you
 
03:48:53.349 --> 03:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
might not be around by the time it
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
caused serious harm
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
do you knowingly let it drip in your
 
03:49:00.389 --> 03:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
roof become a stream and ruin your house
 
03:49:02.309 --> 03:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
so that's it i've i submitted this
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
electronically i have some links at the
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
end to the subject i discuss which
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
obviously can't go into a great length
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
but the links are from actually people
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
far more knowledgeable than i they can
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
discuss that mention public goods and
 
03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
negative externalities border carbon
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment that sort of thing
 
03:49:20.950 --> 03:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
i also just quickly
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the earlier testimony had very short
 
03:49:25.030 --> 03:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
answers to some of the questions that
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
were asked so for instance uh you asked
 
03:49:29.990 --> 03:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
earlier what to do once significant
 
03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
numbers of people are driving evs how do
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
we prepare pay to maintain our roads
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
the the answer is through a
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle miles
 
03:49:41.110 --> 03:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
traveled tax which every year when you
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
get inspected which we're doing every
 
03:49:42.640 --> 03:49:43.990 align:start position:0%
get inspected which we're doing every
year

03:49:43.990 --> 03:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:49:46.150 --> 03:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
they take the miles subtract from the
 
03:49:47.910 --> 03:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
previous year how many miles you've
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
traveled multiply by some factor based
 
03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
on the weight of your car and whatever
 
03:49:53.670 --> 03:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
it costs
 
03:49:55.189 --> 03:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's what they're planning on
 
03:49:57.030 --> 03:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh something like that there because
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're actually losing money
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh on the gas tax to maintain the roads
 
03:50:03.670 --> 03:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
but as was noted
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
the at the federal level i don't know
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
about the state level the federal level
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
the highway trust fund is not even
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
paying for our roads we're already
 
03:50:11.349 --> 03:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
subsidizing them from general revenues
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
not a great idea um the other thing
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the elderly in your
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
district who who complain about their
 
03:50:19.189 --> 03:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
energy bills
 
03:50:21.910 --> 03:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes a true carbon tax
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
would raise their energy bills
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
very little at first but after five ten
 
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
years it would be significant however
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
as long as all of the
 
03:50:35.110 --> 03:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
revenues from that fee are rebated back
 
03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
to households america in america on a
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
per capita basis
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
the average elderly person who's living
 
03:50:43.349 --> 03:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
probably not in a large dwelling
 
03:50:45.590 --> 03:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
probably isn't flying around the world
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't have a speed boat is
 
03:50:49.990 --> 03:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
using less fossil fuels than the
 
03:50:51.670 --> 03:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
national average and therefore would get
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
a payment back from the government
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh monthly under the bill they discussed
 
03:50:58.150 --> 03:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
that actually would exceed their
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
increased cost of energy so they have to
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
depend on the government you're telling
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
me and hopefully the government comes
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
through like a welfare is that what
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
03:51:07.990 --> 03:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
well you uh people who are over 65
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
generally do get their social security
 
03:51:11.110 --> 03:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
payments well they paid into that social
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
security that's their money right and
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
very much the same medicare that's their
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
money coming back very much the same way
 
03:51:19.750 --> 03:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
the money would be coming in
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
from from the from the
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
carbon fee
 
03:51:24.229 --> 03:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
every day
 
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
and once a month
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
it would be divvied up and rebated out
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
and that's a condition that is built
 
03:51:31.349 --> 03:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
into the bill it's not like it's like
 
03:51:32.790 --> 03:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
put in and then they come back three
 
03:51:34.950 --> 03:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
years later and try to extract it all
 
03:51:36.790 --> 03:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
right well i i thank you dear appreciate
 
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
03:51:40.070 --> 03:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
real quick yeah yeah
 
03:51:41.910 --> 03:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
i know we're running
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with mother nature
 
03:51:46.229 --> 03:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
and climate change and uh i admire your
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
passion your knowledge there's just
 
03:51:49.510 --> 03:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
recently a volcano eruption in the
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
pacific i'm sure you're aware of that so
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
in around 1818 it was a gigantic
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
volcanic eruption you may or may not be
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
aware of it in indonesia and it was so
 
03:51:59.040 --> 03:52:00.309 align:start position:0%
aware of it in indonesia and it was so
incredibly

03:52:00.309 --> 03:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
03:52:02.309 --> 03:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
powerful that it changed the climate for
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
a couple years in new hampshire after
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
03:52:07.590 --> 03:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
we had 12 months it snowed every month
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
and this is when all these people got
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
the heck out of new hampshire because it
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
was so cold farmers went to warmer
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
places so
 
03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
given that mother nature changed the
 
03:52:18.070 --> 03:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
climate in that way
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
when that happens again we just had a
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
volcanic eruption right when there's
 
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
another krakatoa type of eruption that's
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
going to lower the temperature of the
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
whole world like as has happened is it
 
03:52:30.790 --> 03:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
possible that if there is global warming
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
which we can debate
 
03:52:34.630 --> 03:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
would might that not be a good thing if
 
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
it tempers the next uh mother nature
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
volcanic climate change cooling first
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a general question a
 
03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
general comment
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not a scientist
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay i took high school biology and
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
chemistry and physics
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
and frankly i don't think the new new
 
03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislature is the place to
 
03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
discover the truth or falsity of
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
scientific concepts that's generally
 
03:52:59.510 --> 03:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
done in our leading universities and i'm
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
sure that when you take your child to
 
03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
the doctor and he says you as he has
 
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
conditioned x y or z
 
03:53:08.229 --> 03:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
and the fellow has gone to medical
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
medical school or fellow gal has gone to
 
03:53:12.790 --> 03:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
medical school and gone through a decade
 
03:53:16.229 --> 03:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
of training you probably don't say
 
03:53:18.469 --> 03:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
hey my buddy at work told me that that's
 
03:53:20.150 --> 03:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
not a real phenomena maybe you do i
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
don't know but myself i generally trust
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
experts in certain fields who have spent
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
their smart people have spent their
 
03:53:27.670 --> 03:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
lives studying stuff
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to
 
03:53:32.229 --> 03:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
to prove or disprove climate change to
 
03:53:34.150 --> 03:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room but regarding the
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
specific question i think it's very
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
important to understand
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
that data from any phenomena whether
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
you're talking about weather
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
or stock prices or political popularity
 
03:53:47.439 --> 03:53:48.790 align:start position:0%
or stock prices or political popularity
has

03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps a trend
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
and around that trend it also has noise
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
right so if you look at
 
03:53:57.269 --> 03:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
if you look at uh
 
03:53:59.670 --> 03:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
the stock market on any given day it's
 
03:53:59.680 --> 03:54:00.550 align:start position:0%
the stock market on any given day it's
like

03:54:00.550 --> 03:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
all day long most of that is noise it
 
03:54:05.349 --> 03:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
means nothing however if you look at a
 
03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
long-term trend and you see that the dow
 
03:54:11.110 --> 03:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
is wherever it is it's tripled in in 15
 
03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:12.150 align:start position:0%
is wherever it is it's tripled in in 15
years

03:54:12.150 --> 03:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's significant right
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
and and that's something that that that
 
03:54:19.349 --> 03:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
we need to look at but the little little
 
03:54:21.189 --> 03:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know anyone who's trying to manage
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
their investment portfolio
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
by by trading stocks at their lunch
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
break is probably not helping themselves
 
03:54:29.189 --> 03:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
likewise with climate
 
03:54:30.870 --> 03:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
yes you'll get people who find these
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
little anomalies and say oh this this
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know on january 3rd
 
03:54:38.710 --> 03:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
five years ago it was actually
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
much warmer than it was today so
 
03:54:42.469 --> 03:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
obviously we're not getting climate
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
change we're not getting uh warming
 
03:54:46.389 --> 03:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
is is not very useful
 
03:54:46.399 --> 03:54:47.510 align:start position:0%
is is not very useful
now

03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
a a a
 
03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
volcano kind of a random event i don't
 
03:54:53.429 --> 03:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
know that there's any trend involved in
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
volcanic eruptions related to climate
 
03:55:00.870 --> 03:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
sure sure so so yes that volcano event
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
volcanic event will temporarily suppress
 
03:55:07.590 --> 03:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh global temperatures in the same way
 
03:55:09.590 --> 03:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
that when we actually when our cars
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
spewed out all sorts of particulates all
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
that stuff in the air suppressed uh
 
03:55:16.150 --> 03:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
warming which is why after we cleaned up
 
03:55:18.150 --> 03:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
our cars from conventional pollution we
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
actually started seeing
 
03:55:23.590 --> 03:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
more more true warming because the the
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's less of that stuff blocking so
 
03:55:27.269 --> 03:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
to answer your question
 
03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
the the trend
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
in temperatures and other effects sea
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
level rise and all the things that are
 
03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
correlated with rises in co2
 
03:55:38.150 --> 03:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
are are unmistakable
 
03:55:40.710 --> 03:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
to people who do this for a living okay
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
and yes the the volcano that just
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
erupted might have some slight
 
03:55:46.479 --> 03:55:47.590 align:start position:0%
erupted might have some slight
temporary

03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
03:55:51.750 --> 03:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh reduction uh a little bit of noise
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to change that trend
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
as long as we continue to emit co2
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
the co2 in the atmosphere is going to
 
03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
continue to rise the methane is going to
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
continue to rise and we're going to
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
continue to get warming with all that
 
03:56:06.229 --> 03:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
entails so
 
03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know focus we really have to focus
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:12.960 --> 03:56:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:56:15.510 --> 03:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:56:15.520 --> 03:56:16.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
yeah

03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:56:18.389 --> 03:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:56:20.070 --> 03:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
very much i appreciate you
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
missing some of your lunch
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to close the hearing on
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
house concur
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
was the bill
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
on um h.r 17 and
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
i was gonna
 
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
i thought we'd have more time but uh
 
03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
when you testify
 
03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many we we don't have
 
03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
anyone testifying on your bill
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:56:41.910 --> 03:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to talk to us a few minutes
 
03:56:41.920 --> 03:56:43.030 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to talk to us a few minutes
after

03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:56:44.950 --> 03:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
on some of the air
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
you know that's going on because i'm
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
willing you know this is out of my area
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm willing to get educated on it
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:01.750 --> 03:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
i have
 
03:58:04.150 --> 03:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'm very disappointed with the executive
 
03:58:05.590 --> 03:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
summary because it doesn't follow the
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
facts of the report
 
03:58:09.750 --> 03:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's written by politicians it's not
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
written by the scientists if you go back
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
and look at the actual
 
03:58:13.760 --> 03:58:18.229 align:start position:0%
and look at the actual
scientific

03:58:18.229 --> 03:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:21.189 --> 03:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
report that basically they in there say
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
oh you know we got one one and a half uh
 
03:58:27.990 --> 03:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
degree change to four and a half degree
 
03:58:29.910 --> 03:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
change depending on what the model is
 
03:58:31.269 --> 03:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
and they say
 
03:58:33.670 --> 03:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
we've been saying this for years and
 
03:58:35.590 --> 03:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's wrong and all due respect i know
 
03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
one of the climate scientists that was a
 
03:58:39.910 --> 03:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
lead author on this report and she is a
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
legitimate climate scientist
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
and it's the climate scientists
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
climate scientists they get the money
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
from nasa doe whatever so all being
 
03:58:53.590 --> 03:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
funded by the same cabal that says we
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
are going to give grants to those that
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
propaganda and i can show you the money
 
03:59:13.520 --> 03:59:18.630 align:start position:0%
propaganda and i can show you the money
flow

03:59:18.630 --> 03:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but there's a sign
 
03:59:23.750 --> 03:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
exxon mobil had a science group in the
 
03:59:25.830 --> 03:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
70s and 80s and they found the same
 
03:59:28.710 --> 03:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
thing that these reports say now
 
03:59:30.309 --> 03:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
they shuttered their
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
climate science group town
 
03:59:34.469 --> 03:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
there's documentation there's a pulitzer
 
03:59:34.479 --> 03:59:36.070 align:start position:0%
there's documentation there's a pulitzer
prize

03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
prize
 
03:59:38.150 --> 03:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
series of articles by inside climate
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
news where they looked at
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
what exxon decided around 1990 rather
 
03:59:46.229 --> 03:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
than go with the science and
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
admit that the carbon that they have on
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
she's not going to keep growing in value
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
they decided
 
03:59:55.750 --> 03:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide increase a problem of the
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
significance and the hype that you guys
 
04:00:06.150 --> 04:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
want to make it it is is it is it so the
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
gray shaded i i referenced to you a
 
04:00:11.830 --> 04:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
climate report that looked at looked at
 
04:00:14.830 --> 04:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide over the last
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
435 million years by looking at stable
 
04:00:18.000 --> 04:00:19.349 align:start position:0%
435 million years by looking at stable
isotopes

04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
isotopes
 
04:00:19.359 --> 04:00:20.150 align:start position:0%
isotopes
okay

04:00:20.150 --> 04:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:21.510 --> 04:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
and basically do you know what the
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
temperature of the earth was then they
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
said no land-based ice then it was ten
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
to twenty we went through we went
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
through glaciation periods not humans
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
we weren't here sea level was 200 feet
 
04:00:32.640 --> 04:00:33.510 align:start position:0%
we weren't here sea level was 200 feet
higher

04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:00:36.150 --> 04:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
all of our coastal cities would be under
 
04:00:38.070 --> 04:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
hundreds of feet lower that's why they
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
were able to come across the bearing
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
straight in and and come into north
 
04:00:45.510 --> 04:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
america during the glacial period when
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
more ice builds up on land the seas go
 
04:00:50.070 --> 04:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
down yes that was that way 15 000 years
 
04:00:50.080 --> 04:00:51.189 align:start position:0%
down yes that was that way 15 000 years
ago

04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:00:53.990 --> 04:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
that was when that melted seas rose
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
hundreds of feet
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
they did the perspective that you guys
 
04:01:01.910 --> 04:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
are pushing is that the world is going
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
a fossil fuel producer and that's not
 
04:01:24.389 --> 04:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.399 --> 04:01:56.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:56.319 --> 04:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:21.670 --> 04:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
i just i'm going to ask a two-part
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
question is um when i assume you uh
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
you've you know about the nullification
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
crisis i believe of 1837
 
04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
and um you know how that would kind of
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
how that those legal precedents would
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
kind of play into what you're kind of
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
describing here in this house concurrent
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
resolution and i'm also wondering how
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
you would imagine in your mind how how
 
04:39:44.470 --> 04:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
states would be
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
nullifying um what you would view as
 
04:39:48.550 --> 04:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional acts by the federal
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
government that um that would possibly
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
violate the state's sovereignty over
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
specific issues issues that the federal
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
well i i'll answer by an example we we
 
04:40:06.550 --> 04:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
recently had two supreme court cases
 
04:40:06.560 --> 04:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
recently had two supreme court cases
addressing

04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
actions by
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
the federal government in
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
implementing vaccine mandates
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
one was you trying to use the powers of
 
04:40:18.878 --> 04:40:19.910 align:start position:0%
one was you trying to use the powers of
osha

04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
osha
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
have that uh
 
04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
that vaccine mandates relevant to
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
anybody who worked in a business over a
 
04:40:31.030 --> 04:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
hundred uh people in size and the other
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
one came from the
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
medical side saying that vaccine
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
mandates can be
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
implemented in the medical community
 
04:40:41.680 --> 04:40:43.830 align:start position:0%
implemented in the medical community
one

04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:40:43.840 --> 04:40:46.230 align:start position:0%
one
was

04:40:46.230 --> 04:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
viewed by the
 
04:40:47.680 --> 04:40:48.788 align:start position:0%
viewed by the
u.s

04:40:48.788 --> 04:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
u.s
 
04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
supreme court as unconstitutional that
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
is the osha
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
derived standard
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the other the medical standard was
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to stand
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
states have
 
04:41:06.390 --> 04:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
have in many states have passed
 
04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
resolutions or state laws saying
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
you cannot mandate people in our state
 
04:41:12.878 --> 04:41:14.708 align:start position:0%
you cannot mandate people in our state
to

04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
to get vaccines and
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
the state that's leading the charge on
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
this right now is florida
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
florida says no vaccine mandates allowed
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
yet the federal government's saying you
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
must mandate
 
04:41:29.680 --> 04:41:30.550 align:start position:0%
must mandate
so

04:41:30.550 --> 04:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
04:41:34.150 --> 04:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
where does the state
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
and how does the state deal with that
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
issue and i think
 
04:41:41.350 --> 04:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:43.510 --> 04:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
the proper uh
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
the answer is the state continues to
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
stand up and say the state of florida is
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
not supporting this and we will not
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
permit prosecution of this particular
 
04:41:58.788 --> 04:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
issue and it may go to further court
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
decisions but the voice of the people
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
must be heard and the only place that
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
voice can be articulated is out of state
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
government people on their own as
 
04:42:13.270 --> 04:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
individuals don't have that authority
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this testimony had said the
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
states have to stand up for their
 
04:42:17.760 --> 04:42:19.350 align:start position:0%
states have to stand up for their
citizens

04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up guide
 
04:42:24.550 --> 04:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um so i i i guess so the
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
reason why i ask these questions is
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
because we're going to be addressing um
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
a constitutional amendment later that
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
would try to make new hampshire
 
04:42:33.270 --> 04:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
independent this a lot of the ideas in
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
this are kind of related to that so
 
04:42:37.110 --> 04:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the reason why i'm asking
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
some of these questions and um so to
 
04:42:39.760 --> 04:42:41.030 align:start position:0%
some of these questions and um so to
clarify

04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
to clarify regarding and i'm going to
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
ask a question about the court cases
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
that you just asked um so obviously the
 
04:42:49.110 --> 04:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
osha case was specifically regarding the
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
federal authority
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
to use the the osha to mandate within um
 
04:42:55.830 --> 04:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
businesses right that are regulated by
 
04:42:57.190 --> 04:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government and obviously
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
that was ruled you know unconstitutional
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
they couldn't use osha for that mandate
 
04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
but with the with the other the medical
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
requirement if i'm not mistaken you can
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but would you
 
04:43:09.190 --> 04:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe that it had to do with
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that states have taken federal
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
dollars right medicare and medicaid
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
dollars right for example new hampshire
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
has taken those and we established the
 
04:43:19.990 --> 04:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
granite advantage healthcare program and
 
04:43:21.270 --> 04:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
by taking those dollars there are
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
certain strings attached so if we wanted
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
could we theoretically if we wanted to
 
04:43:27.430 --> 04:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
just forego those medicare and medicaid
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
dollars and not implement any federal
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
mandates regarding um you know
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh health care mandates that
 
04:43:35.830 --> 04:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
they want regarding attach those monies
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
can we just forego that money and you
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
know preserve our sovereignty haven't we
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
kind of given by adopting that program
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
we've given away our sovereignty by
 
04:43:43.280 --> 04:43:45.270 align:start position:0%
we've given away our sovereignty by
choice

04:43:45.270 --> 04:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:43:47.590 --> 04:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think that is the problem the
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
federal government uh implements
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
programs and said all right if you want
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
this this money you have to agree to
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
these conditions if you want the road
 
04:43:59.590 --> 04:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
tax money to you know uh you you have to
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
agree to our speed limit rules and our
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
other rules associated with your highway
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
system so the federal government has has
 
04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
illegitimately put constraints on
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
on these in order to
 
04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
pull power from the states and
 
04:44:20.230 --> 04:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
aggrandize that to the federal
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
government and at some point you come to
 
04:44:25.270 --> 04:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
the place where you say
 
04:44:28.470 --> 04:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to do it
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to we're not going to
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
permit this and we're going to stand for
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
our state's rights
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for thank you for clarifying
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
that i appreciate it
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
other okay representative
 
04:44:42.958 --> 04:44:43.750 align:start position:0%
other okay representative
so

04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:45.670 --> 04:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:46.638 --> 04:44:48.150 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:48.160 --> 04:44:49.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
in the case in new hampshire for example
 
04:44:51.760 --> 04:44:53.430 align:start position:0%
in the case in new hampshire for example
um

04:44:53.430 --> 04:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:55.990 --> 04:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
at university of new hampshire the
 
04:44:59.110 --> 04:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
president of the university
 
04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
felt compelled or actually i think he
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
probably wanted to do this he
 
04:45:08.070 --> 04:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
supported a vaccine mandate because unh
 
04:45:08.080 --> 04:45:09.110 align:start position:0%
supported a vaccine mandate because unh
was

04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:45:10.948 --> 04:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh receiving
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
millions in
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
national institute of health and other
 
04:45:14.560 --> 04:45:15.750 align:start position:0%
national institute of health and other
federal

04:45:15.750 --> 04:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
right so and
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
this wasn't contested by the usnh board
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
of trustees or
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think anything i didn't hear any
 
04:45:29.270 --> 04:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to this but
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
are you saying that
 
04:45:31.040 --> 04:45:31.990 align:start position:0%
are you saying that
what

04:45:31.990 --> 04:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:45:34.390 --> 04:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
by by adhering to jeffersonian
 
04:45:34.400 --> 04:45:36.150 align:start position:0%
by by adhering to jeffersonian
principles

04:45:36.150 --> 04:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
principles
 
04:45:36.160 --> 04:45:36.948 align:start position:0%
principles
if

04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire said
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
we don't want this to happen at unh
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
that that should take precedent over a
 
04:45:45.280 --> 04:45:46.628 align:start position:0%
that that should take precedent over a
federal

04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh federal law or federal edict that's
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
not been contested in the supreme court
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
at a minimum i'm saying
 
04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has an
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
obligation to say stop with that
 
04:46:00.480 --> 04:46:02.230 align:start position:0%
obligation to say stop with that
nonsense

04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
nonsense
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
at a minimum the voice of the state
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
should be heard
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
we disagree with your
 
04:46:12.160 --> 04:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
we disagree with your
mandates

04:46:13.910 --> 04:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
and and i agree with you i i think the
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the the president of unh and the
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
board they all went
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
along with it because they probably were
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
in agreement with it
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe that is the position
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
of most of the citizens of this state
 
04:46:31.440 --> 04:46:32.550 align:start position:0%
of most of the citizens of this state
right

04:46:32.550 --> 04:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:46:32.560 --> 04:46:33.670 align:start position:0%
right
so

04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
may i have a follow-up yes go ahead so
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
how would we do this would we
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature is responsible for
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
making those statements by resolutions
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
and we have a resolution that we just
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
discussed here before this on carbon tax
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
telling the federal government no we
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't want your carbon taxes we don't
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
want any of that nonsense
 
04:46:56.550 --> 04:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's the obligation of the legislature
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at uh what i had that
 
04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
researcher do christina did a good job
 
04:47:12.310 --> 04:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
on it
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
15 years in this committee here
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
um i've probably seen this
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know eight times
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
nine times
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've passed it under republicans and i
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
tell that under democrats
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay and uh i mean it's just the nature
 
04:47:31.030 --> 04:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
of the beast there that's the way
 
04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
elections have consequences
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
so and i mean i have all the
 
04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
blurbs and everything else over the
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
years that were done in most a lot of
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
them in my name
 
04:47:42.788 --> 04:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
okay just so you know
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh on this here
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a true believer in you know
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
understated rights
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
and the federal government getting out
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
of our homes and our life and pockets
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
but at times others are no
 
04:47:58.550 --> 04:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
disrespect to my friends on the left
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
prefer you know always prefer the
 
04:48:00.320 --> 04:48:01.350 align:start position:0%
prefer you know always prefer the
government

04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:48:02.948 --> 04:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
to be the answer or when it comes to
 
04:48:04.230 --> 04:48:04.240 align:start position:0%

on the communist party of china and to
 
04:52:30.948 --> 04:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
either eliminate the one china policy or
 
04:52:32.550 --> 04:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
to recognize the republic of china

all the parties listed below
 
04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
um and i have an amendment to add the uh
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
people's republic of china's ambassador
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the taiwanese ambassador to that
 
04:52:48.390 --> 04:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
list um
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
now i think we can all agree that what
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
china is doing today amendment now uh i
 
04:52:53.990 --> 04:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
do have the amendment okay no that's
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:58.868 --> 04:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree that what china
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
today is doing is horrible
 
04:53:02.868 --> 04:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
and that's actually something i agreed
 
04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
with former president trump on is that
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
we need to do more to limit china's
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
global influence
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
i believe that we in the new hampshire
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
house need to use our voice to call on
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government and our
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%

04:54:14.070 --> 04:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
blood testing them for when they die
 
04:54:16.470 --> 04:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
that they can harvest their organ organs
 
04:54:18.550 --> 04:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
or putting putting them on wait lists
 
04:54:18.560 --> 04:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
or putting putting them on wait lists
for

04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
organ donation or i would just hate to
 
04:54:23.510 --> 04:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
say yeah i
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
support a resolution that might have
 
04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
something that might be contested
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
i can definitely get the committee more
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
primary sources on that
 
04:54:35.430 --> 04:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
i can read a little thing just from my
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
research on this is that since 1984 uh
 
04:54:40.230 --> 04:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
the removal of organs from executed
 
04:54:42.628 --> 04:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
criminals has been legal and the fact
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
that criminals
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
in china include political prisoners and
 
04:54:48.788 --> 04:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
religious minorities that is uh
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
definitely problematic and that is what
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
happened with these uh falun gong
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners falun gong was not even a
 
04:54:58.390 --> 04:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
religion it was just a
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
it was sort of like yoga as we know it
 
04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
today it was used by people to uh as a
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
sort of spiritual release uh and the
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
communist party of china saw it as a
 
04:55:07.600 --> 04:55:08.470 align:start position:0%
communist party of china saw it as a
threat

04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
threat
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore outlawed it and
 
04:55:12.628 --> 04:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
because of that they harvested the
 
04:55:14.948 --> 04:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
organs of those falun gong practitioners
 
04:55:14.958 --> 04:55:15.910 align:start position:0%
organs of those falun gong practitioners
and

04:55:15.910 --> 04:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
like i said i can get more articles and
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
raw data on that
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
if i may just ask and help you out on
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%

okay uh any other questions
 
04:56:31.830 --> 04:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative marford famous
 
04:56:33.910 --> 04:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
great work on this um but i do have a
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
couple of questions uh do you think that
 
04:56:38.080 --> 04:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
couple of questions uh do you think that
the

04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:42.070 --> 04:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
the wuhan virus and and the or what some
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
folks call the china virus or whatever
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
or the way that the
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
communist leadership in that country
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
handled and has handled and is handling
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
the pandemic crisis
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
do you think that one of the whereases
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
maybe should address that development or
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
what do you think about that
 
04:57:02.320 --> 04:57:03.510 align:start position:0%
what do you think about that
uh

04:57:03.510 --> 04:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
to that question thank you for the
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
question uh specifically i have not done
 
04:57:09.910 --> 04:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
much research on what is happening over
 
04:57:12.390 --> 04:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
in china in response to covet 19. so i
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
do not know the specifics but i just
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
know that this is now in the committee's
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
hands and the committee can do whatever
 
04:57:18.788 --> 04:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
it feels necessary on this bill
 
04:57:20.230 --> 04:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
if follow-up you did say there's an
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
amendment percolating though right yes i
 
04:57:26.230 --> 04:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that would add the uh
 
04:57:28.628 --> 04:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
ambassador of china to the united states
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
to the list of uh
 
04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
places the house clerk will forward this
 
04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
copy of this resolution and i also added
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
the taiwanese uh ambassador to that list
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
because if we're condemning china we we
 
04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
should probably be actually telling them
 
04:57:46.708 --> 04:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you for that i get my
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
point is that if if there is an
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
amendment percolating if
 
04:57:53.200 --> 04:57:53.990 align:start position:0%
amendment percolating if
if

04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:57:54.000 --> 04:57:54.788 align:start position:0%
if
you

04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:57:56.550 --> 04:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
wanted the amendment to include
 
04:57:58.550 --> 04:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
something about the pandemic this would
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity for that if if that
 
04:58:02.948 --> 04:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
worked for you it's up to you with with
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you're working on
 
04:58:04.878 --> 04:58:05.590 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you're working on
well

04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%

04:58:08.948 --> 04:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
mean bill right now
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
and if we want to put something on there
 
04:58:13.110 --> 04:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
we could very easily do that yeah in the
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh ols amendment's already drafted and
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%

this house resolution very short very

this house resolution very short very
simple

05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
simple
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to keep my remarks
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
short and not waste the committee's time
 
05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
all this says is that we want a
 
05:16:58.390 --> 05:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
permanent place to store our nuclear
 
05:16:58.400 --> 05:16:59.510 align:start position:0%
permanent place to store our nuclear
waste

05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
waste
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
currently in the united states
 
05:17:03.990 --> 05:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
we were building a nuclear waste
 
05:17:06.310 --> 05:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
repository to store this waste because
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know nuclear waste stays radioactive
 
05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
for thousands of years
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
we were building a place to store that
 
05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
waste permanently in the middle of the
 
05:17:15.590 --> 05:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
nevada desert
 
05:17:18.070 --> 05:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
and that plan got defunded under the
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
obama administration
 
05:17:21.830 --> 05:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
so currently the united states has no
 
05:17:23.670 --> 05:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
permanent solution to
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
its nuclear waste
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
and the reason that this is important
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire is that
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
we do have a nuclear power facility in
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
seabrook and all this says is that we
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't want nuclear fuel and nuclear
 
05:17:38.708 --> 05:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
spent nuclear fuel in our backyard we
 
05:17:40.868 --> 05:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
want it to be stored underground in the
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
middle of the desert not close to
 
05:17:42.400 --> 05:17:44.708 align:start position:0%
middle of the desert not close to
anybody

05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
so that it can degrade slowly and be
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
away from humans because we don't want
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
you know nuclear waste currently it's
 
05:17:54.550 --> 05:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
stored right next to the nuclear power
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
plant if something goes wrong not only
 
05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
do we have the nuclear power plant to
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
deal with but the waste that's next to
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
it that could be affected by whatever
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
event occurs
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
so this is saying that we would like
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
our waste to be
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
stored somewhere out of the state uh not
 
05:18:12.390 --> 05:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere close to us
 
05:18:15.750 --> 05:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
or or any uh you know human civilization
 
05:18:15.760 --> 05:18:16.628 align:start position:0%
or or any uh you know human civilization
so

05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:16.638 --> 05:18:17.510 align:start position:0%
so
that's

05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:18:19.830 --> 05:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
all this house resolution calls for and
 
05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
i know it doesn't say specifically where
 
05:18:23.830 --> 05:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
we would like it to be built but uh it's
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
at least asking the federal government
 
05:18:25.200 --> 05:18:26.390 align:start position:0%
at least asking the federal government
to

05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
05:18:39.750 --> 05:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
sure thank you mr chair yes uh thank you
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
take my question representative uh yucca
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
mountain i think
 
05:18:47.350 --> 05:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
nevada was the
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
sound like the best possible place but
 
05:18:53.110 --> 05:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh senator harry reid and
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
and some of other folks with him uh said
 
05:18:58.628 --> 05:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
that they would never support that and i
 
05:19:02.070 --> 05:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
guess i understand that my question is
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
you call for federal government to
 
05:19:06.868 --> 05:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
construct a nuclear waste repository
 
05:19:08.310 --> 05:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
if a
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
foreign country
 
05:19:13.430 --> 05:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
i could name several possibilities
 
05:19:15.910 --> 05:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
kazakhstan for example
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
ironically uh but
 
05:19:21.110 --> 05:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
if if we if we can't put it anywhere in
 
05:19:22.948 --> 05:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
america and if we can't do yucca
 
05:19:24.150 --> 05:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
mountain i don't know where we're gonna
 
05:19:24.160 --> 05:19:25.190 align:start position:0%
mountain i don't know where we're gonna
go

05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:19:25.200 --> 05:19:27.030 align:start position:0%
go
uh

05:19:27.030 --> 05:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:28.788 --> 05:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
what about
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
a foreign repository
 
05:19:33.750 --> 05:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
do you have you looked and talked about
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
that thought about that
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
i personally and thank you for the
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
question i personally have not heard of
 
05:19:42.150 --> 05:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
any uh foreign waste repository plans
 
05:19:43.590 --> 05:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
but i definitely do think that that
 
05:19:45.430 --> 05:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
could be a viable solution because we
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
want this to be as far away as
 
05:19:50.310 --> 05:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
as possible from us because we don't
 
05:19:51.350 --> 05:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:19:54.830 --> 05:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
have to deal with any of the leakage or
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
possibilities of contamination to the
 
05:19:59.750 --> 05:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
general population
 
05:19:59.760 --> 05:20:00.628 align:start position:0%
general population
so

05:20:00.628 --> 05:20:00.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
i i definitely think that that is a
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
possibility and the federal government
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
should look into any possibility for
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
permanent storage of this waste
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
any other okay did you have a question
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
you all said
 
05:20:17.350 --> 05:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:20:17.360 --> 05:20:20.230 align:start position:0%
anyone else
okay

05:20:20.230 --> 05:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:20.240 --> 05:20:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:20:24.230 --> 05:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where i'm at on this here
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
do we have nowhere and seabrook are you
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
saying that seabrook is the only area in
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where they store
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge uh the nuclear waste
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
from seabrook is stored on seabrook but
 
05:20:41.670 --> 05:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
i do not know of any other locations in
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that nuclear waste
 
05:20:45.590 --> 05:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
such as nuclear
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
fuel is stored in new hampshire
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
at least that is my understanding of the
 
05:20:49.520 --> 05:20:50.708 align:start position:0%
at least that is my understanding of the
situation

05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:20:52.708 --> 05:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i get to look into this a
 
05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
little more
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have anyone else
 
05:20:56.160 --> 05:20:58.230 align:start position:0%
we don't have anyone else
speaking

05:20:58.230 --> 05:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
05:21:01.750 --> 05:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you then uh
 
05:21:04.830 --> 05:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
well if anyone else wants to speak
 
05:21:04.840 --> 05:21:06.708 align:start position:0%
well if anyone else wants to speak
uh

05:21:06.708 --> 05:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
then i am going to close the hearing on
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
h.r 16
 
05:21:11.120 --> 05:21:11.990 align:start position:0%
h.r 16
and

05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
2 45
 
05:21:21.190 --> 05:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
that went quick so what i'm going to do
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.280 --> 05:21:40.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:40.798 --> 05:21:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:44.070 --> 05:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know you know why harry reid put a
 
05:21:45.990 --> 05:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
stop to it with obama and the rest of us
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
because they've got minerals out there
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
and they they're buying up all the land
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
and the government's calling it
 
05:21:54.390 --> 05:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
monuments and they're going in and
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:03.030 --> 05:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah part of the reason jerry went to
 
05:22:03.040 --> 05:45:58.470 align:start position:0%
yeah part of the reason jerry went to
prison

05:45:58.470 --> 05:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:00.310 --> 05:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't have that on
 
05:46:03.270 --> 05:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to say that again
 
05:46:06.470 --> 05:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:46:10.470 --> 05:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing on hr18
 
05:46:10.480 --> 05:46:11.270 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing on hr18
and

05:46:11.270 --> 05:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
on a resolution urging congress to
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
remove the exception from the 13th
 
05:46:17.190 --> 05:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
amendment except as a punishment from
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
crime whereof the party shall have been
 
05:46:21.190 --> 05:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
duly convicted and welcome
 
05:46:23.670 --> 05:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative amanda bolden
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
who supports the bill and the prime
 
05:46:29.350 --> 05:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor and said four minutes
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thanks for hearing
 
05:46:34.470 --> 05:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:36.708 --> 05:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
i sent around a handout of the 13th
 
05:46:39.670 --> 05:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
amendment for your reference
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
because sometimes when bills reference
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
a portion of an entire text you need the
 
05:46:48.788 --> 05:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:50.070 --> 05:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
i come from
 
05:46:52.150 --> 05:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
slave owning people recently the
 
05:46:54.548 --> 05:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
washington post put out an article
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the a list of every congressman
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
who's ever served in us congress who had
 
05:47:00.000 --> 05:47:00.948 align:start position:0%
who's ever served in us congress who had
slaves

05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
slaves
 
05:47:03.430 --> 05:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i searched the word bolden and yep
 
05:47:05.190 --> 05:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
there were two people that i'm related
 
05:47:07.510 --> 05:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
to who served in u.s congress and owned
 
05:47:07.520 --> 05:47:09.670 align:start position:0%
to who served in u.s congress and owned
slaves

05:47:09.670 --> 05:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
slaves
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
my 11th great grandfather landed on this
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
continent in the early 1600s and my
 
05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
fifth great grandfather was one of the
 
05:47:19.350 --> 05:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
congressmen that i'm related to who was
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
a slave owner serving in congress in the
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
1800s representing virginia
 
05:47:27.350 --> 05:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
and you know how here we
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
write down a lot of the like we'll print
 
05:47:31.030 --> 05:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
the remarks you know the speeches that
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
are made on the house floor and record
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
them i've read
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh speeches from my very boring
 
05:47:39.270 --> 05:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
fifth grade grandfather james wood
 
05:47:41.190 --> 05:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
bolden and he argued passionately in
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
defense of slavery and he said that it's
 
05:47:46.230 --> 05:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
a man's natural right to own another man
 
05:47:48.070 --> 05:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
and he compared
 
05:47:49.590 --> 05:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
the ownership of another person to the
 
05:47:54.628 --> 05:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:54.638 --> 05:47:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:47:57.270 --> 05:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
he was also super irritated with women
 
05:47:59.350 --> 05:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
being involved in politics and i'm
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
really sure he wouldn't like me
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
but you guys wouldn't like him because
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
he's also the kind of uh representative
 
05:48:08.548 --> 05:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
who talks forever and ever and ever and
 
05:48:10.390 --> 05:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's literally pages and pages of his
 
05:48:12.788 --> 05:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
stupid speech and it's so boring um and
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'll try not to be like him today
 
05:48:17.110 --> 05:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
um but he was the kind congressman that
 
05:48:18.708 --> 05:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
as soon as he went up to the well you'd
 
05:48:21.170 --> 05:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
leave to go to the bathroom
 
05:48:21.180 --> 05:48:22.788 align:start position:0%
leave to go to the bathroom
[Music]

05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:48:24.070 --> 05:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure that he would be
 
05:48:25.590 --> 05:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
disappointed to know that just a few
 
05:48:27.430 --> 05:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
years after he died the 13th amendment
 
05:48:29.350 --> 05:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
was ratified
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
freeing the slaves in the united states
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
so the 13th amendment banned slavery it
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
nullified the fugitive slave clause and
 
05:48:39.750 --> 05:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
it nullified the three-fifths compromise
 
05:48:41.190 --> 05:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
but there was a loophole in the 13th
 
05:48:42.548 --> 05:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
amendment you can read it on the handout
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's in bold
 
05:48:46.390 --> 05:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
it allows for slavery still
 
05:48:48.470 --> 05:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
if the enslaved person has been
 
05:48:50.470 --> 05:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
convicted of a crime
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
and this interpretation isn't just mine
 
05:48:54.948 --> 05:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
um in the case of roughin the
 
05:48:57.910 --> 05:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
commonwealth in 1871 the supreme court
 
05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
declared that an inmate is a slave of
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:49:03.750 --> 05:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
due to this loophole almost as soon as
 
05:49:05.590 --> 05:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
the 13th amendment was ratified states
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
and municipalities began passing petty
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
crime laws
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
which at the time were known as the
 
05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
black codes
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
these laws criminalized actions that
 
05:49:15.750 --> 05:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
were most likely to be committed by
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
recently freed slaves
 
05:49:20.788 --> 05:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
such as loitering and vagrancy because
 
05:49:23.430 --> 05:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
if you had a home and you left it
 
05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
now you have no home if you had a job
 
05:49:27.030 --> 05:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
but you were freed from it now you have
 
05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
no job
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
some of these laws prohibited former
 
05:49:31.270 --> 05:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
slaves from holding certain types of
 
05:49:33.750 --> 05:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
jobs and then punish them
 
05:49:35.590 --> 05:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
for being unemployed
 
05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
plantations accustomed to slave labor
 
05:49:39.030 --> 05:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
were suffering a labor shortage as a
 
05:49:40.708 --> 05:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
result of the ratification of the 13th
 
05:49:43.110 --> 05:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
amendment so area prisons sold prisoner
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
labor to the plantations on the cheap
 
05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
the prisoners themselves received no
 
05:49:49.350 --> 05:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
money for their work as returning to
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
their former slave life was considered a
 
05:49:52.708 --> 05:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
fair punishment for the crime of
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
loitering vagrancy unemployment etc
 
05:49:57.510 --> 05:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
the black codes have been expanding ever
 
05:49:57.520 --> 05:49:58.310 align:start position:0%
the black codes have been expanding ever
since

05:49:58.310 --> 05:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
albeit under different terminology such
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
as the war on drugs mandatory minimum
 
05:50:03.350 --> 05:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
sentencing and so forth
 
05:50:05.110 --> 05:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
in the early 1900s the black codes were
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
used to justify over-incarceration and
 
05:50:09.510 --> 05:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
harassment of italian-americans during a
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
period of time in which italians were
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
widely hated in the united states so
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
effectively my ancestors defended a
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
system that likely resulted in the
 
05:50:20.150 --> 05:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
harassment of the chairman's ancestors
 
05:50:22.708 --> 05:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
the exception in the 13th amendment laid
 
05:50:24.150 --> 05:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
the essential groundwork for the mass
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
incarceration we see today
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
in fact the prison population in
 
05:50:30.548 --> 05:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
proportion to the total population has
 
05:50:32.230 --> 05:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
increased by more than 10 times since
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
the ratification of the 13th amendment
 
05:50:36.548 --> 05:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
in other words the prison population is
 
05:50:39.270 --> 05:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
outpacing the u.s population by a
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
multiplier of more than 10.
 
05:50:44.230 --> 05:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
and while my fifth grade grandfather
 
05:50:45.750 --> 05:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
didn't live to see it many of the people
 
05:50:47.190 --> 05:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
he served with
 
05:50:48.868 --> 05:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
ensured that the 13th amendment didn't
 
05:50:50.390 --> 05:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
really have teeth
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
so today it's my hope that this body can
 
05:50:54.628 --> 05:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
reject everything my family stood for
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
and ask our current congress
 
05:50:58.628 --> 05:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
to close the loophole in the 13th
 
05:51:01.430 --> 05:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
amendment let's make james wood bolden
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
roll over in his grave and by the way
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
here's how much james wood bolden is my
 
05:51:08.230 --> 05:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
ancestor his middle name
 
05:51:10.310 --> 05:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
is my grandfather's first name my
 
05:51:11.910 --> 05:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
father's middle name and my brother's
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
middle name
 
05:51:16.390 --> 05:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
so this is like literally my bloodline
 
05:51:16.400 --> 05:51:17.750 align:start position:0%
so this is like literally my bloodline
um

05:51:17.750 --> 05:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:19.510 --> 05:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
and as an aside i just want to mention
 
05:51:21.110 --> 05:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
that support for closing this loophole
 
05:51:23.670 --> 05:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
in the 13th amendment is um
 
05:51:26.470 --> 05:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
supported by kanye west
 
05:51:29.190 --> 05:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
who went to president trump in 2018 and
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
asked for the same thing that i'm asking
 
05:51:32.230 --> 05:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
for today
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i also want to mention that the bill
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
has bipartisan co-sponsorship or i guess
 
05:51:38.070 --> 05:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
because of you guys
 
05:51:40.470 --> 05:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
tripartisan or something
 
05:51:40.480 --> 05:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
tripartisan or something
so

05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for your time and i hope i was
 
05:51:44.070 --> 05:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
brief enough
 
05:51:47.430 --> 05:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you will you take questions
 
05:51:49.030 --> 05:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
of course okay
 
05:51:51.110 --> 05:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
05:51:51.120 --> 05:51:52.548 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative

representative bolden for your testimony
um

05:51:57.510 --> 05:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's a couple questions so first uh do
 
05:52:00.400 --> 05:52:01.830 align:start position:0%
that's a couple questions so first uh do
you

05:52:01.830 --> 05:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:52:02.708 --> 05:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:52:03.990 --> 05:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
do you like you know we're talking about
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
the black codes and
 
05:52:07.990 --> 05:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh do you like you know do you still do
 
05:52:10.230 --> 05:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
you believe in the you know the
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
the school to prison pipeline for
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
for for african-americans in our in our
 
05:52:14.638 --> 05:52:16.070 align:start position:0%
for for african-americans in our in our
country

05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:52:17.910 --> 05:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
you believe that exists sorry
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i absolutely
 
05:52:25.270 --> 05:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
um it's unfortunate that i think that um
 
05:52:27.670 --> 05:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i i had a nanny when i was a kid who
 
05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
insisted that if you put baby oil in
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
your belly button it can help with a
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
cold you know and so sometimes there's
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
things that the people before us believe
 
05:52:39.990 --> 05:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
and they they want to implement and as
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
time goes by we realize it doesn't make
 
05:52:43.270 --> 05:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
sense but if we let those things kind of
 
05:52:45.910 --> 05:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
grow and expand they they become
 
05:52:48.310 --> 05:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
unrecognizable compared to their former
 
05:52:50.948 --> 05:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
their original version and totally out
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
of control and i think that
 
05:52:55.990 --> 05:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
um probably the people who wanted to
 
05:52:58.628 --> 05:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
reinvigorate and enable slavery through
 
05:53:00.470 --> 05:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
the loophole in the 13th amendment
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate that one day their uh
 
05:53:07.030 --> 05:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
the the white people that would be born
 
05:53:09.430 --> 05:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
after them would also be caught up in
 
05:53:11.430 --> 05:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
the same sort of system
 
05:53:11.440 --> 05:53:12.230 align:start position:0%
the same sort of system
of

05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
mass incarceration and it's certainly
 
05:53:15.040 --> 05:53:15.910 align:start position:0%
mass incarceration and it's certainly
seen

05:53:15.910 --> 05:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
seen
 
05:53:18.450 --> 05:53:18.460 align:start position:0%
largely in new hampshire where
 
05:53:18.460 --> 05:53:19.590 align:start position:0%
largely in new hampshire where
[Music]

05:53:19.590 --> 05:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:53:19.600 --> 05:53:21.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
the

05:53:21.750 --> 05:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:53:23.590 --> 05:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
the war on drugs
 
05:53:25.670 --> 05:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:53:28.708 --> 05:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
the issue of widespread heroin abuse and
 
05:53:30.070 --> 05:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
05:53:30.080 --> 05:53:31.350 align:start position:0%
things like that
wasn't

05:53:31.350 --> 05:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
05:53:33.750 --> 05:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
much discussed when it was uh
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:53:37.830 --> 05:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
um just a black problem you know for
 
05:53:39.910 --> 05:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term and now when it
 
05:53:41.910 --> 05:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
becomes an issue in new hampshire which
 
05:53:43.670 --> 05:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
is mostly white suddenly people and
 
05:53:46.150 --> 05:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
politicians want to talk about it so i
 
05:53:47.670 --> 05:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
05:53:48.868 --> 05:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
it's definitely one of those things
 
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
where it started in one format you know
 
05:53:53.270 --> 05:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
it was just a dumb
 
05:53:55.110 --> 05:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
baby oil in your belly button sort of
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
thing and
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
you know if you keep listening to and
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
implementing that line of thinking
 
05:54:00.958 --> 05:54:02.310 align:start position:0%
implementing that line of thinking
um

05:54:02.310 --> 05:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's just more insanity down the line
 
05:54:06.788 --> 05:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
so i do think that in the long term it
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
do you know the name of the largest uh
 
05:54:15.910 --> 05:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
prison in our country
 
05:54:15.920 --> 05:54:17.190 align:start position:0%
prison in our country
um

05:54:17.190 --> 05:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:19.350 --> 05:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
no i don't
 
05:54:20.708 --> 05:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
the uh angola state prison
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
i've heard of this yeah and one final
 
05:54:28.230 --> 05:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
one follow-up good um and just my last
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
question did you know um
 
05:54:34.390 --> 05:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
did you know that in uh
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
we're in this pandemic
 
05:54:39.030 --> 05:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
um and we you know we're trying to make
 
05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
sure that we can speed up the production
 
05:54:42.788 --> 05:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
of things that would hopefully kept us
 
05:54:44.548 --> 05:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
that would keep us safe
 
05:54:46.150 --> 05:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that the state of
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
new york
 
05:54:47.680 --> 05:54:48.868 align:start position:0%
new york
used

05:54:48.868 --> 05:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:54:51.910 --> 05:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
prison labor to
 
05:54:55.030 --> 05:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
to to basically produce
 
05:54:57.910 --> 05:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
hand sanitizer at six dollars and ten
 
05:55:00.150 --> 05:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
cents a gallon
 
05:55:02.708 --> 05:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
um i believe that i know that even today
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of products that you can
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
purchase for example in walmart that are
 
05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
made by um slaves in american prisons
 
05:55:12.390 --> 05:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
and in foreign prisons um and
 
05:55:14.470 --> 05:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
there's the story of this guy
 
05:55:17.110 --> 05:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
who was eventually he was tried six
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
times for the same murder this was just
 
05:55:22.070 --> 05:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
in like the late 90s until recently
 
05:55:24.470 --> 05:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
and over the period of the six trials
 
05:55:26.948 --> 05:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
um many of which ended in a mistrial um
 
05:55:30.628 --> 05:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
or hung jury he um spent 20 years in
 
05:55:33.670 --> 05:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
prison and oddly during that time period
 
05:55:36.150 --> 05:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
was picking cotton in fields in america
 
05:55:38.788 --> 05:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
and this is you know in the um after the
 
05:55:41.190 --> 05:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
year 2000 and he was an innocent man as
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
well as far as you know
 
05:55:42.958 --> 05:55:43.910 align:start position:0%
well as far as you know
uh

05:55:43.910 --> 05:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:55:45.830 --> 05:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
as far as anyone can tell his name is
 
05:55:47.190 --> 05:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
curtis flowers
 
05:55:49.910 --> 05:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
he's he just got out of uh prison and
 
05:55:53.350 --> 05:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
out of that cycle i think in 2020 and
 
05:55:55.270 --> 05:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
he's putting his life back together but
 
05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
he was a slave of the state as the
 
05:56:02.788 --> 05:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:05.670 --> 05:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay represent moffitt thank you mr
 
05:56:07.830 --> 05:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to understand this so
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the
 
05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
made our license plates on our vehicles
 
05:56:13.440 --> 05:56:14.708 align:start position:0%
made our license plates on our vehicles
or

05:56:14.708 --> 05:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:56:16.470 --> 05:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
our license plates are the products of
 
05:56:17.750 --> 05:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
slave labor
 
05:56:18.868 --> 05:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:56:20.708 --> 05:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
kind of what i'm hearing or am i not
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
hearing it right
 
05:56:22.798 --> 05:56:23.590 align:start position:0%
hearing it right
um

05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:25.350 --> 05:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the weight the rate of the
 
05:56:30.390 --> 05:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
wages in
 
05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
the prisons in new hampshire is limited
 
05:56:36.390 --> 05:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
i know there's been legislation to give
 
05:56:38.470 --> 05:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
prisoners an hourly wage that's
 
05:56:38.480 --> 05:56:39.510 align:start position:0%
prisoners an hourly wage that's
reasonable

05:56:39.510 --> 05:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
05:56:42.150 --> 05:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
um but in most prisons
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh prisoners receive little to no pay
 
05:56:48.150 --> 05:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
for the work that they're required to do
 
05:56:49.990 --> 05:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question but
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
our license plates and our badges i
 
05:56:54.548 --> 05:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
think not our badges anymore because
 
05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
i guess we couldn't get a good price
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i heard but our badges used
 
05:56:59.990 --> 05:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
to be made by prisoners in new hampshire
 
05:57:01.750 --> 05:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
and you can go down the road
 
05:57:03.830 --> 05:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:57:07.750 --> 05:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
the showroom on uh what's it called
 
05:57:09.350 --> 05:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh when you get north on main street and
 
05:57:11.030 --> 05:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's called fisherville road instead
 
05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
here in concord on the right across from
 
05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
the prison is uh the showroom where you
 
05:57:16.628 --> 05:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
can buy and i bought like a coaster
 
05:57:18.470 --> 05:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
there um that was painted and it's made
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
of wood
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that the items
 
05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
that are sold there the money doesn't go
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
to the prisoners
 
05:57:25.990 --> 05:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
so the concept was
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
the concept that people were sold was
 
05:57:28.948 --> 05:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
they're being punished
 
05:57:31.510 --> 05:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
and this is a fair punishment but most
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the time even then and now
 
05:57:35.670 --> 05:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:57:38.948 --> 05:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
reasons that people end up in prison um
 
05:57:38.958 --> 05:57:40.070 align:start position:0%
reasons that people end up in prison um
their

05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:57:41.750 --> 05:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of slavery as punishment isn't
 
05:57:44.868 --> 05:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
really justified
 
05:57:46.788 --> 05:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
said thank you
 
05:57:49.910 --> 05:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:52.948 --> 05:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
hello and uh thank you for bringing this
 
05:57:54.868 --> 05:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
legislative very important legislation
 
05:57:56.868 --> 05:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh to our committee
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
my question is the reason that this is
 
05:58:00.548 --> 05:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
before our committee and before the new
 
05:58:02.868 --> 05:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire house of representatives uh is
 
05:58:02.878 --> 05:58:03.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire house of representatives uh is
because

05:58:03.990 --> 05:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:58:05.990 --> 05:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to pressure our delegation
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
and pressure the federal government to
 
05:58:09.430 --> 05:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
do something on this issue and
 
05:58:11.430 --> 05:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
is my understanding of that correct
 
05:58:12.628 --> 05:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
that's correct it's just a house
 
05:58:14.390 --> 05:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
resolution it's a statement
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
but i think you guys know that being on
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
this committee i was on this committee
 
05:58:19.750 --> 05:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
for a long time um and a resolution is
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
just a letter that you write and maybe
 
05:58:24.150 --> 05:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
someone reads it maybe nobody does but
 
05:58:25.430 --> 05:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
at a minimum it's a statement
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative of the views of the body
 
05:58:28.868 --> 05:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
and of the state
 
05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure you're aware uh of course
 
05:58:32.788 --> 05:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
this is i don't know why you did it as
 
05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
an hr versus hr cr or joint because this
 
05:58:39.430 --> 05:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
is only even if we pass this
 
05:58:41.190 --> 05:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
it only shows just one part of new
 
05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire the house has no weight with
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the senate doesn't
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
take up house concurrent resolutions so
 
05:58:50.470 --> 05:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
there'd be no point it would be a waste
 
05:58:52.708 --> 05:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
of taxpayer money they have a rule there
 
05:58:54.548 --> 05:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
they have taken up resolutions but you
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
have to work them and go talk to the
 
05:58:58.628 --> 05:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
senators to get the support they do take
 
05:59:00.788 --> 05:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
them out so they do have a rule yep and
 
05:59:01.750 --> 05:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
that they don't take up house
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
concurrence that'd be why
 
05:59:03.680 --> 05:59:05.910 align:start position:0%
concurrence that'd be why
okay

05:59:05.910 --> 05:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:59:07.430 --> 05:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
because you have senator waters on there
 
05:59:09.510 --> 05:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
and he could have talked to senator what
 
05:59:12.070 --> 05:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think if you get four or five senators
 
05:59:13.750 --> 05:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
to prove to say they want to take it up
 
05:59:15.030 --> 05:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
then they take it out it's good to have
 
05:59:17.430 --> 05:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
senate support on this uh resolution
 
05:59:17.440 --> 05:59:18.390 align:start position:0%
senate support on this uh resolution
yeah

05:59:18.390 --> 05:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i just uh you you kind of mentioned
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:59:25.270 --> 05:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
you talked about this not being a fair
 
05:59:27.670 --> 05:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
punishment but um so what what would
 
05:59:29.670 --> 05:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
what would you propose as a replacement
 
05:59:32.470 --> 05:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
for this punishment and um i also you
 
05:59:37.270 --> 05:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
know to kind of twofold this is um what
 
05:59:39.270 --> 05:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
what would um
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
do do prisoners that partake in this
 
05:59:44.548 --> 05:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
labor even if they're not compensated
 
05:59:46.310 --> 05:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
do they do they not get some kind of
 
05:59:47.910 --> 05:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
benefit out of it if they're developing
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
skills and if it's preventing
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
recidivization later on if they're able
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
to develop skills and help to them
 
05:59:56.230 --> 05:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
honestly too pay for some of the costs
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
that the state has to incur to ensure
 
05:59:59.670 --> 05:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
that there's justice and that you know
 
06:00:02.470 --> 06:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
they serve out a specific sentence so
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just kind of curious what your
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts on those kinds of things would
 
06:00:05.200 --> 06:00:06.788 align:start position:0%
thoughts on those kinds of things would
be

06:00:06.788 --> 06:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:00:08.070 --> 06:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question i think there's
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
a palpable difference between skill
 
06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
building and slavery
 
06:00:11.920 --> 06:00:13.030 align:start position:0%
building and slavery
and

06:00:13.030 --> 06:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:00:14.548 --> 06:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
i think that a similar argument could
 
06:00:17.110 --> 06:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
have been made by my ancestor
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
in congress arguing that
 
06:00:19.440 --> 06:00:20.948 align:start position:0%
in congress arguing that
um

06:00:20.948 --> 06:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
that enslavement was better for the
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
people that were enslaved at the time
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
because then they'd have something to do
 
06:00:28.708 --> 06:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
they'd have work
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
to keep them busy and that it was
 
06:00:32.548 --> 06:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
character building
 
06:00:33.990 --> 06:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:00:35.750 --> 06:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
slavery is a different
 
06:00:38.230 --> 06:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
experience than skill building um
 
06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
because if skill building and slavery
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
are not different then what was
 
06:00:44.470 --> 06:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
elementary school you know
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
and what is uh
 
06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
having a job at dunkin donuts but the
 
06:00:51.430 --> 06:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
difference is being compensated and so
 
06:00:52.868 --> 06:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
it's not to say that someone shouldn't
 
06:00:55.510 --> 06:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
be skill building in uh
 
06:00:57.670 --> 06:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
when they're in confinement in a penal
 
06:00:57.680 --> 06:00:59.030 align:start position:0%
when they're in confinement in a penal
institution

06:00:59.030 --> 06:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
institution
 
06:01:00.230 --> 06:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not to say that someone
 
06:01:01.270 --> 06:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
06:01:03.430 --> 06:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
learning new things or working
 
06:01:04.948 --> 06:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
06:01:07.670 --> 06:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
an issue of not being compensated
 
06:01:09.910 --> 06:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
um and as far as what i would propose as
 
06:01:09.920 --> 06:01:11.190 align:start position:0%
um and as far as what i would propose as
punishment

06:01:11.190 --> 06:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
06:01:12.948 --> 06:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have all those answers
 
06:01:15.190 --> 06:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'm 1 in 400 and that is something that
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
an entity like this one decides
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
through the representative democratic
 
06:01:20.160 --> 06:01:21.190 align:start position:0%
through the representative democratic
process

06:01:21.190 --> 06:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:01:21.200 --> 06:01:21.910 align:start position:0%
process
and

06:01:21.910 --> 06:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
similar entities in every state as well
 
06:01:24.000 --> 06:01:25.190 align:start position:0%
similar entities in every state as well
as

06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:01:25.200 --> 06:01:25.910 align:start position:0%
as
in

06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:01:27.670 --> 06:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
the u.s congress
 
06:01:29.110 --> 06:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that that deserves a
 
06:01:31.350 --> 06:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
well-rounded democratic conversation and
 
06:01:31.360 --> 06:01:32.548 align:start position:0%
well-rounded democratic conversation and
debate

06:01:32.548 --> 06:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
debate
 
06:01:34.150 --> 06:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't propose any particular
 
06:01:36.628 --> 06:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
thing but if um
 
06:01:40.470 --> 06:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:46.390 --> 06:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
an outdated um backwards idea that's
 
06:01:46.400 --> 06:01:47.830 align:start position:0%
an outdated um backwards idea that's
uh

06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:01:50.948 --> 06:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
it's overdue for elimination
 
06:01:53.190 --> 06:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh at this point that particular portion
 
06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the 13th amendment thank you for
 
06:01:54.840 --> 06:01:56.548 align:start position:0%
of the 13th amendment thank you for
clarifying

06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
clarifying
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah representative i've got a few
 
06:02:00.788 --> 06:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
relatives that done some time in jail
 
06:02:02.390 --> 06:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i always told him you do the crimes
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
you the time
 
06:02:03.760 --> 06:02:04.628 align:start position:0%
you the time
and

06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:04.638 --> 06:02:05.910 align:start position:0%
and
um

06:02:05.910 --> 06:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
on the compensation in i mean some of 20
 
06:02:10.390 --> 06:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
you should can you speak a little louder
 
06:02:13.830 --> 06:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i want to hear you but i'm not
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
sure i should be on the speaker here
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
06:02:18.150 --> 06:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
but what i'm saying i have a few
 
06:02:20.070 --> 06:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
relatives have done 20 30 years in
 
06:02:20.080 --> 06:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
relatives have done 20 30 years in
prison

06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
prison
 
06:02:22.948 --> 06:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
and i've always told them when they get
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
out with you do the crime you do the
 
06:02:24.240 --> 06:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
out with you do the crime you do the
time

06:02:25.110 --> 06:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:02:27.670 --> 06:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
but anyways my question with you is
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they compensate
 
06:02:31.910 --> 06:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers back for paying for those
 
06:02:33.990 --> 06:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
years because they did the crime
 
06:02:36.310 --> 06:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
not the people in the
 
06:02:39.270 --> 06:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know outside the prisons
 
06:02:39.280 --> 06:02:40.070 align:start position:0%
you know outside the prisons
um

06:02:40.070 --> 06:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:42.628 --> 06:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty big
 
06:02:44.310 --> 06:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
philosophical debate
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's a big can of worms um what the
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
design of someone's punishment should be
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
whether they should compensate the state
 
06:02:53.990 --> 06:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
or compensate
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
the person that they
 
06:02:56.240 --> 06:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
the person that they
harmed

06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
harmed
 
06:03:00.390 --> 06:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
but when you're talking about crimes
 
06:03:00.400 --> 06:03:02.230 align:start position:0%
but when you're talking about crimes
like

06:03:02.230 --> 06:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:03:03.910 --> 06:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
the sort of crimes that were created out
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
of thin air not long after the passage
 
06:03:07.830 --> 06:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
of the 13th amendment with its loophole
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about crimes like
 
06:03:12.310 --> 06:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
being a former slave with no job being a
 
06:03:14.470 --> 06:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
former slave with no home
 
06:03:16.708 --> 06:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
that's just breathing that's just how
 
06:03:19.030 --> 06:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
their lives were for a period of time
 
06:03:21.510 --> 06:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
after the end of the civil war
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
so that's not a that's not a situation
 
06:03:26.470 --> 06:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
in which someone arguably from like an
 
06:03:29.270 --> 06:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
ethical perspective a moral perspective
 
06:03:33.350 --> 06:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
has offended the state or its people
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
and ought to um
 
06:03:39.110 --> 06:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
make some kind of compensation for that
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
racism you know it's just a world in an
 
06:03:45.670 --> 06:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
economy that depended on slavery
 
06:03:45.680 --> 06:03:46.948 align:start position:0%
economy that depended on slavery
and

06:03:46.948 --> 06:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
and it was having trouble adjusting to
 
06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
the lack of slavery as part of its
 
06:03:53.670 --> 06:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
economy um and the labor shortage that
 
06:03:55.910 --> 06:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
was created by the end of the civil war
 
06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
so that's not really the same as
 
06:04:00.628 --> 06:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
making right after you've done wrong
 
06:04:00.638 --> 06:04:01.590 align:start position:0%
making right after you've done wrong
and

06:04:01.590 --> 06:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:04.390 --> 06:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that would prohibit
 
06:04:05.990 --> 06:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
a legislature
 
06:04:06.000 --> 06:04:06.948 align:start position:0%
a legislature
from

06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:04:09.670 --> 06:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
creating and passing laws that ensure
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
that someone can and should make right
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
when they've done wrong and we have laws
 
06:04:15.830 --> 06:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the books that already
 
06:04:17.350 --> 06:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
enable that
 
06:04:18.390 --> 06:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm in a criminal justice and i
 
06:04:21.750 --> 06:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
vaguely remember seeing we've had a lot
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
of bills lately
 
06:04:24.868 --> 06:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
but i remember seeing some bill that had
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
uh it was
 
06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
changing a portion of existing law the
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
existing lawn mentioned of like a a
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that
 
06:04:33.200 --> 06:04:34.230 align:start position:0%
requirement that
the

06:04:34.230 --> 06:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:04:34.240 --> 06:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
the
offender

06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
offender
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
pay compensation to the victim we
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
already have laws like that in place and
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
um i
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
also i think that there's supreme court
 
06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
history for in new hampshire about the
 
06:04:47.190 --> 06:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
issue of making prisoners pay for their
 
06:04:48.390 --> 06:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
confinement and i think that it's
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
illegal i think that it may be
 
06:04:53.190 --> 06:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
there may we i think that we have laws
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
against making prisoners pay for their
 
06:04:56.948 --> 06:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
own confinement but as far as making
 
06:04:58.230 --> 06:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
right with the person that they've
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
harmed we have laws in place to allow
 
06:05:02.470 --> 06:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
for that and when the thing that you've
 
06:05:04.948 --> 06:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
done wrong is being homeless
 
06:05:07.110 --> 06:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
who are you making it right to you know
 
06:05:09.350 --> 06:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
now you do know that we have prisoners
 
06:05:10.788 --> 06:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
now well they're getting out there
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
paying for their halfway house they're
 
06:05:15.270 --> 06:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
paying for their bracelets
 
06:05:17.350 --> 06:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh that they have on their ankles all
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's being paid for by the individuals
 
06:05:22.628 --> 06:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think that this
 
06:05:24.868 --> 06:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
resolution if it were even adopted by
 
06:05:26.470 --> 06:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
congress which i know is exceedingly
 
06:05:26.480 --> 06:05:28.470 align:start position:0%
congress which i know is exceedingly
unlikely

06:05:28.470 --> 06:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
unlikely
 
06:05:30.150 --> 06:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
would change that
 
06:05:31.830 --> 06:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay my last thing for you even if
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
congress adopted it uh wouldn't that
 
06:05:37.030 --> 06:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
still have to come to the states uh
 
06:05:39.830 --> 06:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
um ratification that that's a big debate
 
06:05:42.390 --> 06:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
and i think you're talking about the um
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah under the basically it is
 
06:05:46.708 --> 06:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
a fifth amendment issue
 
06:05:48.868 --> 06:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
yeah and the bill it says
 
06:05:49.990 --> 06:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:51.510 --> 06:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the reason and the bill says nothing
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
about article five at all on i mean it
 
06:05:55.830 --> 06:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh on what's in there because the
 
06:05:57.750 --> 06:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
congress with two thirds there's two
 
06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
methods described that
 
06:06:02.070 --> 06:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you all know from being on this
 
06:06:03.750 --> 06:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee that there's a lot of debate
 
06:06:05.590 --> 06:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
as to the intent of article five and
 
06:06:06.868 --> 06:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
06:06:08.708 --> 06:06:08.718 align:start position:0%
the drafters left to get pizza while
 
06:06:10.230 --> 06:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
they were working on it and forgot that
 
06:06:11.350 --> 06:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's what they were working on and
 
06:06:14.548 --> 06:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
started on the article six after that um
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
but it does seem unclear and unfinished
 
06:06:18.548 --> 06:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
article five but this encourages
 
06:06:20.070 --> 06:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
congress to use whatever means that
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
they'd like to adopt to execute this
 
06:06:25.270 --> 06:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative uh lead
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
one last one last question you guys are
 
06:06:29.590 --> 06:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
really thorough oh appreciate it um one
 
06:06:31.670 --> 06:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
last question thank you mr chair and uh
 
06:06:33.510 --> 06:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of following along
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative bro uh representative
 
06:06:37.510 --> 06:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
deshaz's comments and that is our
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions all right would you believe
 
06:06:42.390 --> 06:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
that in california the inmates who
 
06:06:45.830 --> 06:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
helped uh put out the fires there
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
were not allowed to become um
 
06:06:51.110 --> 06:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to go through the
 
06:06:53.430 --> 06:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
process of becoming firefighters
 
06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
following uh
 
06:06:56.788 --> 06:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
them finishing their sense
 
06:06:58.390 --> 06:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh i would believe that that is one of
 
06:07:01.350 --> 06:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
the issues is that even if even if this
 
06:07:03.670 --> 06:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
enslavement that occurs is skill
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
building there's no certification
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that someone can take
 
06:07:10.230 --> 06:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
with them and say yeah i'm a felon but i
 
06:07:11.670 --> 06:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
learned how to do carpentry so you
 
06:07:13.270 --> 06:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
should hire me
 
06:07:15.910 --> 06:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're a felon certainly
 
06:07:18.150 --> 06:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
supersedes any interest in your
 
06:07:20.070 --> 06:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications and it's not like jails
 
06:07:22.628 --> 06:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
are handing out certifications
 
06:07:24.548 --> 06:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
so you can build all those skills but if
 
06:07:26.150 --> 06:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
you have nothing to show for it as far
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
as qualified education
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
and that's and they're not providing
 
06:07:30.230 --> 06:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
that then
 
06:07:32.470 --> 06:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's not really useful
 
06:07:34.470 --> 06:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
for when you're uh in general in the
 
06:07:37.110 --> 06:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
general population in the world
 
06:07:39.590 --> 06:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh no other questions
 
06:07:41.110 --> 06:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for your time
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
thanks for your time oh you're welcome
 
06:07:44.070 --> 06:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
on my committee we don't ask a lot of
 
06:07:46.070 --> 06:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions so this has been fun well this
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
year we do
 
06:07:49.590 --> 06:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah you ever don't
 
06:07:51.510 --> 06:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
i don't are you the clerk do you want my
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
bullet points
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i just printed them for me
 
06:07:55.110 --> 06:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
welcome to you if it makes your life
 
06:07:57.990 --> 06:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
easier yeah well we as you know we deal
 
06:07:59.750 --> 06:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
with a lot of constitutional issues and
 
06:08:02.470 --> 06:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
it pays us to understand article five
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
and the legislation i think if anything
 
06:08:06.470 --> 06:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't say
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
anything in there concerning uh you know
 
06:08:11.590 --> 06:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
the article five on the legislators uh
 
06:08:14.548 --> 06:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
making um you know with two-thirds or
 
06:08:15.990 --> 06:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's just it's
 
06:08:17.990 --> 06:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
recommending or asking
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
yeah which is probably why you're not
 
06:08:20.708 --> 06:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
going to get a lot of testimony today
 
06:08:22.470 --> 06:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
from all those folks
 
06:08:24.708 --> 06:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
no debate
 
06:08:26.310 --> 06:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
just wish it was the house concurrent
 
06:08:28.390 --> 06:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
our house joint resolution
 
06:08:30.070 --> 06:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
and then you worked it behind the scenes
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
because you do have a good senate i like
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
senator waters i've worked with him on
 
06:08:35.350 --> 06:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
legislation before
 
06:08:37.270 --> 06:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
that he would work it with the other
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
senators in the senate to show the state
 
06:08:40.948 --> 06:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
06:08:43.430 --> 06:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
versus just part of new hampshire well
 
06:08:46.230 --> 06:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
we can also do this just as one body i i
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
understand that but you know how i've
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
been on house resolutions
 
06:08:51.750 --> 06:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
with just one body versus the whole body
 
06:08:53.590 --> 06:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
but thank you
 
06:08:53.600 --> 06:08:55.670 align:start position:0%
but thank you

06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
fashion yes because she's out of step
 
06:09:38.310 --> 06:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
with the other two where you got a
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
kernel you got a top sergeant you got
 
06:09:41.830 --> 06:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
the first side and you're leading the
 
06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
charge with the kernel backing them up
 
06:09:46.708 --> 06:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
06:09:49.430 --> 06:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
so the last time we had any involvement
 
06:09:50.548 --> 06:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
06:09:54.310 --> 06:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
went uh with a colonel picture me uh
 
06:09:55.990 --> 06:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
softball uh
 
06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
and me uh lining a hard grounder down
 
06:10:00.628 --> 06:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
the third baseline and you're making a
 
06:10:02.470 --> 06:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
diving stop and
 
06:10:04.708 --> 06:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's all caught on video
 
06:10:07.590 --> 06:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
i view it every once in a while
 
06:10:09.190 --> 06:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
before you get started here you notice
 
06:10:11.190 --> 06:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
you notice the beautiful swing i put on
 
06:10:13.510 --> 06:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
it uh before you get started here i just
 
06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
wanted for the rec
 
06:10:17.590 --> 06:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:19.750 --> 06:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
the marine bed sitting right there could
 
06:10:21.990 --> 06:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
hit that ball softball
 
06:10:22.868 --> 06:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
to the
 
06:10:24.470 --> 06:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
moments of the fence or over the fence
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
so just you know i just wanted to
 
06:10:28.390 --> 06:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
hit it over yeah well you came close all
 
06:10:29.910 --> 06:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
right but go ahead
 
06:10:31.990 --> 06:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
i i gave it a couple of good wraps the
 
06:10:33.830 --> 06:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
two games i played i thought it's not
 
06:10:36.548 --> 06:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
too bad for an 80 year old guy
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
no i'm all the way to 83. i don't know
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
if i could still do it or not
 
06:10:42.868 --> 06:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
but anyway i'm pleased to be before you
 
06:10:42.878 --> 06:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
but anyway i'm pleased to be before you
uh

06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:10:43.920 --> 06:10:45.270 align:start position:0%
uh
and

06:10:45.270 --> 06:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:49.270 --> 06:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
so i do support uh these this resolution
 
06:10:49.280 --> 06:10:49.990 align:start position:0%
so i do support uh these this resolution
and

06:10:49.990 --> 06:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:51.750 --> 06:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
even though i understand your
 
06:10:54.310 --> 06:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
reservations with regard to hr's
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
but it does say on line five you know
 
06:10:58.230 --> 06:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
house clerks will forward official
 
06:11:00.070 --> 06:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
copies of this resolution of the
 
06:11:01.510 --> 06:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
president united states speaker of the
 
06:11:03.670 --> 06:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
united states house of representatives
 
06:11:05.270 --> 06:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
president of the united states senate
 
06:11:06.948 --> 06:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
and to all members of the new hampshire
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
congressional delegation because the
 
06:11:12.310 --> 06:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
reality is that that this
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment is is not exactly a
 
06:11:18.070 --> 06:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
particularly uh you know
 
06:11:18.080 --> 06:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
particularly uh you know
reputable

06:11:19.350 --> 06:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
reputable
 
06:11:19.360 --> 06:11:20.150 align:start position:0%
reputable
uh

06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:11:22.708 --> 06:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
addition to the constitution in my pe in
 
06:11:24.788 --> 06:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
my opinion because
 
06:11:25.910 --> 06:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
it did
 
06:11:27.910 --> 06:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
lend itself and it still lends itself
 
06:11:29.830 --> 06:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons i support this
 
06:11:31.830 --> 06:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
because it lends itself
 
06:11:33.030 --> 06:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
even today
 
06:11:34.948 --> 06:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
to abuse
 
06:11:37.830 --> 06:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to people being a sentence
 
06:11:40.470 --> 06:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
to involuntary servitude
 
06:11:42.788 --> 06:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
i will answer some of the questions you
 
06:11:42.798 --> 06:11:45.030 align:start position:0%
i will answer some of the questions you
raised

06:11:45.030 --> 06:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
raised
 
06:11:47.910 --> 06:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
to the previous witness
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
because i do think that that people who
 
06:11:51.360 --> 06:11:52.070 align:start position:0%
because i do think that that people who
are

06:11:52.070 --> 06:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:11:54.310 --> 06:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh who are imprisoned
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh for whatever
 
06:12:00.310 --> 06:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
particular infraction or crime um
 
06:12:00.320 --> 06:12:02.230 align:start position:0%
particular infraction or crime um
uh

06:12:02.230 --> 06:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:04.788 --> 06:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
they they should not merely be
 
06:12:07.030 --> 06:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
kept away from society
 
06:12:07.040 --> 06:12:07.830 align:start position:0%
kept away from society
uh

06:12:07.830 --> 06:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:09.510 --> 06:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
there obviously is in the case of
 
06:12:12.230 --> 06:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
certain criminals uh a need to protect
 
06:12:14.470 --> 06:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
society from people who are
 
06:12:16.788 --> 06:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
killers rapists
 
06:12:18.150 --> 06:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
and other other
 
06:12:20.150 --> 06:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
violent acts
 
06:12:23.350 --> 06:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
where people are harmed or killed
 
06:12:25.750 --> 06:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
society needs to be protected that's why
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
we have life imprisonment
 
06:12:29.280 --> 06:12:30.150 align:start position:0%
we have life imprisonment
and

06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:33.590 --> 06:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the same time uh that clearly is that
 
06:12:36.070 --> 06:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
society benefits from having those
 
06:12:38.390 --> 06:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
people locked away obviously because
 
06:12:41.990 --> 06:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're not free to con continue their
 
06:12:46.230 --> 06:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
depredations crimes and misdeeds
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
but that they are
 
06:12:48.240 --> 06:12:49.430 align:start position:0%
but that they are
getting

06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting
 
06:12:52.628 --> 06:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
clearly people are sentenced to life uh
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're not getting out um
 
06:12:58.470 --> 06:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
and and uh so society is being protected
 
06:13:00.470 --> 06:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
to some degree but by and large you know
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
most people are not sentenced to life
 
06:13:05.110 --> 06:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
they're not executed uh they're gonna
 
06:13:06.310 --> 06:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
get out
 
06:13:09.788 --> 06:13:09.798 align:start position:0%
uh and so rehabilitation we all know
 
06:13:14.390 --> 06:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation is a an equal a part of
 
06:13:16.868 --> 06:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
the idea of people being imprisoned that
 
06:13:18.788 --> 06:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
because they're going to get out it
 
06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
would be better if
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
they have learned some kind of a skill
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
and in point of fact as you probably
 
06:13:27.270 --> 06:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
know we're all members of the
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
county delegations in our individual
 
06:13:32.070 --> 06:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
counties um i happen to be the chair of
 
06:13:34.868 --> 06:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
the stratford county delegation now for
 
06:13:37.430 --> 06:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think this is my 12th year as the
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
chair of the county delegation
 
06:13:40.080 --> 06:13:41.110 align:start position:0%
chair of the county delegation
and

06:13:41.110 --> 06:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:13:43.590 --> 06:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that our prisoners do
 
06:13:43.600 --> 06:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
one of the things that our prisoners do
but

06:13:44.310 --> 06:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
they're not sentenced to involuntary
 
06:13:46.798 --> 06:13:49.270 align:start position:0%
they're not sentenced to involuntary
servitude

06:13:49.270 --> 06:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
servitude
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh they are imprisoned for a period of
 
06:13:55.510 --> 06:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
time uh and many of them
 
06:13:55.520 --> 06:13:56.310 align:start position:0%
time uh and many of them
are

06:13:56.310 --> 06:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:13:58.310 --> 06:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
gainfully employed
 
06:13:59.430 --> 06:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:14:01.430 --> 06:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
in in the hub county house of
 
06:14:03.910 --> 06:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
corrections and they are learning
 
06:14:05.270 --> 06:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative delemus is a member of
 
06:14:07.350 --> 06:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
the stratfor county delegation
 
06:14:08.628 --> 06:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
looking around
 
06:14:10.868 --> 06:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
i see that she's the only one other than
 
06:14:12.948 --> 06:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
myself here who's a member of strafford
 
06:14:15.830 --> 06:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
county delegation but we know that our
 
06:14:15.840 --> 06:14:17.510 align:start position:0%
county delegation but we know that our
in

06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:14:19.750 --> 06:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are incarcerated in
 
06:14:21.270 --> 06:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
stratford county
 
06:14:23.910 --> 06:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to work while
 
06:14:26.310 --> 06:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
they're there they're not exactly well
 
06:14:28.788 --> 06:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
paid but they they earn something and
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
again to your point mr chairman to your
 
06:14:32.000 --> 06:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
again to your point mr chairman to your
question

06:14:33.750 --> 06:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:14:36.230 --> 06:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
they they shouldn't be
 
06:14:39.430 --> 06:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be paid you know even
 
06:14:41.350 --> 06:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
minimum wages
 
06:14:42.868 --> 06:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
because they are
 
06:14:42.878 --> 06:14:44.070 align:start position:0%
because they are
receiving

06:14:44.070 --> 06:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
06:14:46.868 --> 06:14:46.878 align:start position:0%
room and board uh and and
 
06:14:48.708 --> 06:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
paying their debt to society in some
 
06:14:51.350 --> 06:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
fashion so that they're not making you
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
know top dollar i understand that and i
 
06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
support that um
 
06:14:59.030 --> 06:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
although you know sometimes i think the
 
06:15:01.590 --> 06:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
wages they're paid uh are
 
06:15:03.670 --> 06:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes anti-competitive you're also
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
aware of that right that that some of
 
06:15:08.230 --> 06:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
the outside businesses engaged in the
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%

06:15:14.708 --> 06:15:14.718 align:start position:0%
issues with regard to
 
06:15:14.718 --> 06:15:16.470 align:start position:0%
issues with regard to

can buy
 
06:15:25.110 --> 06:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
that they're they're produced in the new
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire state prison to my knowledge
 
06:15:29.510 --> 06:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's the case
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
but but one of the things that i happen
 
06:15:33.670 --> 06:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
to know in strafford county is that a
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
number of our people are learning
 
06:15:35.520 --> 06:15:36.788 align:start position:0%
number of our people are learning
laundry

06:15:36.788 --> 06:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
laundry
 
06:15:39.910 --> 06:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh skills uh which is quite in demand
 
06:15:42.788 --> 06:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
i'm informed uh so they're learning a
 
06:15:42.798 --> 06:15:43.750 align:start position:0%
i'm informed uh so they're learning a
trade

06:15:43.750 --> 06:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
trade
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh that they they're they're serving a
 
06:15:49.190 --> 06:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
useful benefit the laundry for uh for
 
06:15:51.670 --> 06:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
the uh for the nursing home in stratford
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
county and
 
06:15:55.670 --> 06:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh and also for the prison itself
 
06:15:57.830 --> 06:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
is done by the
 
06:16:00.310 --> 06:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individuals but they are
 
06:16:02.470 --> 06:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
learning that skill and that trade so
 
06:16:04.390 --> 06:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
that is a benefit to them
 
06:16:06.390 --> 06:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
and as i understand that that's uh
 
06:16:09.430 --> 06:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's fairly well paid and in demand
 
06:16:09.440 --> 06:16:10.868 align:start position:0%
that's fairly well paid and in demand
so

06:16:10.868 --> 06:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:13.350 --> 06:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
it's a combination right they're low
 
06:16:16.390 --> 06:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
paid that's the give back in terms of
 
06:16:16.400 --> 06:16:17.670 align:start position:0%
paid that's the give back in terms of
the

06:16:17.670 --> 06:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:16:20.470 --> 06:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
take back if you will uh to to the
 
06:16:22.788 --> 06:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
county taxpayers who are paying the cost
 
06:16:25.270 --> 06:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
of maintaining their their uh
 
06:16:27.990 --> 06:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration and their room and board
 
06:16:29.270 --> 06:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
06:16:30.310 --> 06:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
06:16:33.190 --> 06:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
getting back to the the language itself
 
06:16:36.390 --> 06:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh this was clearly and historically put
 
06:16:38.390 --> 06:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
in place
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
06:16:41.590 --> 06:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
take advantage
 
06:16:44.948 --> 06:16:44.958 align:start position:0%
of of people and very often the
 
06:16:44.958 --> 06:16:46.708 align:start position:0%
of of people and very often the
convictions

06:16:46.708 --> 06:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
convictions
 
06:16:49.270 --> 06:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
were of a questionable nature i won't
 
06:16:51.510 --> 06:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
say that they they were plucked off the
 
06:16:54.470 --> 06:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
streets because they needed
 
06:16:54.480 --> 06:16:55.590 align:start position:0%
streets because they needed
needed

06:16:55.590 --> 06:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
needed
 
06:16:59.110 --> 06:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
20 people for the chain gang
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't be surprised if that were
 
06:17:04.230 --> 06:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
not the case in many cases i'm currently
 
06:17:06.470 --> 06:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
reading a book called
 
06:17:08.868 --> 06:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
devil in the grove
 
06:17:11.430 --> 06:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
like an apple grove
 
06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
and it tells the story of
 
06:17:15.830 --> 06:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
people down in one of the southern
 
06:17:15.840 --> 06:17:17.350 align:start position:0%
people down in one of the southern
states

06:17:17.350 --> 06:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:17:20.708 --> 06:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
and they are they were actually in many
 
06:17:23.750 --> 06:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
cases picked up and incarcerated because
 
06:17:25.110 --> 06:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
they did need
 
06:17:25.120 --> 06:17:25.910 align:start position:0%
they did need
some

06:17:25.910 --> 06:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:17:27.270 --> 06:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
slave labor
 
06:17:29.590 --> 06:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
and we all know the song about the chain
 
06:17:32.150 --> 06:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
gang sweating on the chain gang every
 
06:17:32.160 --> 06:17:34.708 align:start position:0%
gang sweating on the chain gang every
day

06:17:34.708 --> 06:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:37.110 --> 06:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
and the chain gang and we i'm sure many
 
06:17:39.430 --> 06:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
of us are familiar with the movie uh
 
06:17:40.868 --> 06:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
cool hand luke
 
06:17:42.628 --> 06:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
uh where they're out there on the road
 
06:17:45.510 --> 06:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
gangs and in many cases they had
 
06:17:45.520 --> 06:17:46.390 align:start position:0%
gangs and in many cases they had
uh

06:17:46.390 --> 06:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
prisoners who were uh who were very
 
06:17:51.750 --> 06:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
conveniently available
 
06:17:53.110 --> 06:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
06:17:55.670 --> 06:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
it certainly was abused in the past
 
06:17:57.670 --> 06:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
look at it look at the history not just
 
06:17:59.670 --> 06:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
in movies but look at the history and
 
06:18:01.750 --> 06:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see that that many
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
of people of color uh were definitely
 
06:18:08.788 --> 06:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh you know put to work uh involuntarily
 
06:18:11.270 --> 06:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
because this
 
06:18:13.830 --> 06:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
except as punishment punishment for a
 
06:18:16.150 --> 06:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
crime where the party shall have been
 
06:18:19.030 --> 06:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
duly convicted it lends itself even in
 
06:18:21.510 --> 06:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
this day and age to abuse
 
06:18:24.788 --> 06:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
so i think uh i think i've
 
06:18:27.670 --> 06:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
i think i've made my case
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
and since i'm
 
06:18:31.830 --> 06:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
playing hooky from my own committee
 
06:18:33.910 --> 06:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
which is running late i will take no
 
06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
questions okay but uh it's very good to
 
06:18:37.670 --> 06:18:37.680 align:start position:0%

06:18:39.510 --> 06:18:39.520 align:start position:0%

now my plan is to uh have the um
 
06:19:06.548 --> 06:19:06.558 align:start position:0%
hearing here
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%

06:19:11.030 --> 06:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
if we overfold then i will move to the
 
06:19:11.040 --> 06:19:12.628 align:start position:0%
if we overfold then i will move to the
um

06:19:12.628 --> 06:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:14.230 --> 06:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
reps hall but otherwise we're going to
 
06:19:16.948 --> 06:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:19.270 --> 06:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
just so you know jerry made
 
06:19:21.270 --> 06:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
30 a month
 
06:19:23.990 --> 06:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
and he worked full time and was teaching
 
06:19:25.670 --> 06:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
teaching construction and doing
 
06:19:28.230 --> 06:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
construction and jobbing uh costing out
 
06:19:31.030 --> 06:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
jobs for the prison that he was in and
 
06:19:34.390 --> 06:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:36.468 --> 06:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
and there was no rehabilitation in that
 
06:19:36.478 --> 06:19:37.990 align:start position:0%
and there was no rehabilitation in that
prison

06:19:37.990 --> 06:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
prison
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
yeah on that last bill
 
06:19:42.310 --> 06:19:42.320 align:start position:0%

06:19:44.468 --> 06:19:44.478 align:start position:0%
between in the constitution maybe
 
06:19:45.670 --> 06:19:45.680 align:start position:0%

06:34:38.310 --> 06:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
this november
 
06:34:39.670 --> 06:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
06:34:41.350 --> 06:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of supporters who will tell
 
06:34:44.070 --> 06:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
you all the various reasons why
 
06:34:46.628 --> 06:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
this caacr needs to be on the ballot in

this caacr needs to be on the ballot in
november

06:34:47.750 --> 06:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
november
 
06:34:49.510 --> 06:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
and if you have a question for me i'd be
 
06:34:51.190 --> 06:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
06:34:52.628 --> 06:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative we have a good
 
06:34:54.390 --> 06:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
pile of pink cards here and we're
 
06:34:56.230 --> 06:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
looking forward here hearing testimony
 
06:34:58.230 --> 06:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
and you will take questions um i have
 
06:34:59.830 --> 06:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
one and maybe a couple of follow-ups and
 
06:35:03.190 --> 06:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
there and there may be others
 
06:35:05.590 --> 06:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
presumably you no longer
 
06:35:07.590 --> 06:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
recite the pledge of allegiance because
 
06:35:09.270 --> 06:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
that pledge does
 
06:35:11.750 --> 06:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
refer to one nation indivisible is that
 
06:35:14.548 --> 06:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
correct that is not correct
 
06:35:16.788 --> 06:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
so you do still say the pledge of
 
06:35:19.750 --> 06:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
allegiance i do not i
 
06:35:22.070 --> 06:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
have a belief
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
in a higher power that does not allow me
 
06:35:25.830 --> 06:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
to pledge to
 
06:35:28.070 --> 06:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
some other authority
 
06:35:29.830 --> 06:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:35:31.430 --> 06:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
did you know that over
 
06:35:35.350 --> 06:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
4 000 new hampshire men died or killed
 
06:35:37.270 --> 06:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
during the civil war fighting to
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
preserve our union and that thousands
 
06:35:42.150 --> 06:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
more were wounded and
 
06:35:44.070 --> 06:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
some of the regimental colors here at
 
06:35:45.990 --> 06:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
the state house
 
06:35:47.270 --> 06:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
still have
 
06:35:49.030 --> 06:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
bloodstained from that conflict do you
 
06:35:51.590 --> 06:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
think that the cacr does their
 
06:35:54.788 --> 06:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
memory or their service a disservice i
 
06:35:56.948 --> 06:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
think it actually does them an actual
 
06:35:56.958 --> 06:35:58.070 align:start position:0%
think it actually does them an actual
honor

06:35:58.070 --> 06:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
honor
 
06:35:59.590 --> 06:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
if they were here
 
06:36:01.110 --> 06:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
to see what
 
06:36:03.990 --> 06:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
has become of washington dc
 
06:36:05.350 --> 06:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
and the lack
 
06:36:08.390 --> 06:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
of freedom that we have as a result here
 
06:36:10.468 --> 06:36:10.478 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
06:36:11.990 --> 06:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think they'd be horrified i think
 
06:36:14.070 --> 06:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
they'd be very proud of this group of
 
06:36:15.430 --> 06:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
supporters here
 
06:36:18.070 --> 06:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
that pushed to have this brought to the

06:36:30.868 --> 06:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
constituents generally support this
 
06:36:32.628 --> 06:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
measure or have you pulled them or do
 
06:36:33.830 --> 06:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:36:35.830 --> 06:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
i haven't polled everybody i've had
 
06:36:37.750 --> 06:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly uh
 
06:36:40.390 --> 06:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
a good number of uh supporters obviously
 
06:36:42.948 --> 06:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
i've had some detractors it's
 
06:36:42.958 --> 06:36:43.830 align:start position:0%
i've had some detractors it's
it's

06:36:43.830 --> 06:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:36:45.830 --> 06:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
not universally
 
06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
considered a wonderful idea but
 
06:36:50.708 --> 06:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
we'll find out if the people get a
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
chance to vote on it in november we'll
 
06:36:54.868 --> 06:36:54.878 align:start position:0%

06:37:03.990 --> 06:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
lebranch
 
06:37:06.468 --> 06:37:06.478 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
06:37:08.868 --> 06:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
my first question is do you believe that
 
06:37:10.788 --> 06:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire could support itself and
 
06:37:13.510 --> 06:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
sustain itself as an independent uh
 
06:37:15.590 --> 06:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
country as an independent democracy if
 
06:37:17.750 --> 06:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
the cacr were to be passed by the people
 
06:37:18.948 --> 06:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
this november
 
06:37:19.910 --> 06:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
i do
 
06:37:22.070 --> 06:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a
 
06:37:25.430 --> 06:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
has great resources great people
 
06:37:26.948 --> 06:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
currently we are
 
06:37:29.270 --> 06:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
among one of the the top economies in
 
06:37:31.750 --> 06:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
the country we are net donors to the
 
06:37:34.628 --> 06:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
federal government if we had that drain
 
06:37:36.230 --> 06:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
relieved from us
 
06:37:37.590 --> 06:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
we could
 
06:37:40.150 --> 06:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
do all kinds of things um
 
06:37:40.630 --> 06:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
06:37:40.640 --> 06:37:42.310 align:start position:0%
that would be
[Music]

06:37:42.310 --> 06:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:37:44.868 --> 06:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
quite possibly phenomenal
 
06:37:48.150 --> 06:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
follow up follow what uh my follow-up is
 
06:37:48.160 --> 06:37:49.350 align:start position:0%
follow up follow what uh my follow-up is
uh

06:37:49.350 --> 06:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:37:51.750 --> 06:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i understand that in new hampshire the
 
06:37:53.670 --> 06:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
only way to get something on the ballot
 
06:37:55.030 --> 06:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
at least to my understanding as a
 
06:37:57.910 --> 06:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative is through a cacr like
 
06:37:57.920 --> 06:37:59.430 align:start position:0%
representative is through a cacr like
this

06:37:59.430 --> 06:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:38:01.510 --> 06:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
why not introduce a house bill that
 
06:38:03.510 --> 06:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
would allow for referendums and to make
 
06:38:06.230 --> 06:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
this a non-binding constitutional
 
06:38:06.240 --> 06:38:07.830 align:start position:0%
this a non-binding constitutional
issue

06:38:07.830 --> 06:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:38:09.910 --> 06:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
people have uh toyed with the idea of
 
06:38:13.750 --> 06:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
referendum uh and
 
06:38:16.548 --> 06:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's necessarily
 
06:38:19.270 --> 06:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
the the best way to go i think our our
 
06:38:22.390 --> 06:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
tradition here is has lasted for
 
06:38:24.150 --> 06:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
the duration and
 
06:38:26.548 --> 06:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
it seems to work very well
 
06:38:31.190 --> 06:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:34.310 --> 06:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:38:36.310 --> 06:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
06:38:37.350 --> 06:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:38:40.628 --> 06:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
okay at the top of our pink list uh as a
 
06:38:42.708 --> 06:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
practice we generally try to allow
 
06:38:45.670 --> 06:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
legislators uh
 
06:38:48.868 --> 06:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
first chances to to testify not looking
 
06:39:05.590 --> 06:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:08.070 --> 06:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
did i just no i didn't unplug it uh
 
06:39:10.468 --> 06:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh for the record i'm
 
06:39:12.788 --> 06:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
representative jess edwards representing
 
06:39:15.110 --> 06:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
auburn chester and sandown
 
06:39:16.468 --> 06:39:16.478 align:start position:0%
uh today
 
06:39:17.750 --> 06:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
my testimonial at the end of it will
 
06:39:22.150 --> 06:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
feel a little bit like
 
06:39:24.788 --> 06:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
you know on one hand there's this on the
 
06:39:27.190 --> 06:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
other hand there's this
 
06:39:29.110 --> 06:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
i can
 
06:39:31.510 --> 06:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh it really goes without saying that
 
06:39:33.190 --> 06:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
our federal government
 
06:39:33.200 --> 06:39:34.708 align:start position:0%
our federal government
has

06:39:34.708 --> 06:39:34.718 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:39:38.708 --> 06:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
grown its powers grossly beyond
 
06:39:41.270 --> 06:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
any that were intended or limited by our
 
06:39:41.280 --> 06:39:42.868 align:start position:0%
any that were intended or limited by our
constitution

06:39:42.868 --> 06:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:39:45.910 --> 06:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:47.270 --> 06:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
06:39:49.990 --> 06:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
they jeopardize the growth of the
 
06:39:51.430 --> 06:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
06:39:54.230 --> 06:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes the harmony
 
06:39:56.230 --> 06:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
that comes from governing with the
 
06:39:58.948 --> 06:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
consent of the governed
 
06:40:01.990 --> 06:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh i think uh if this trend were to
 
06:40:02.000 --> 06:40:03.990 align:start position:0%
uh i think uh if this trend were to
continue

06:40:03.990 --> 06:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
continue
 
06:40:05.910 --> 06:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
whether it be decades or
 
06:40:07.910 --> 06:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
100 years i don't know
 
06:40:09.670 --> 06:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
i would say that we're on a very bad
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
trajectory in that it's this kind of
 
06:40:15.430 --> 06:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
involvement in government that can help
 
06:40:17.750 --> 06:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
us turn things back around
 
06:40:20.310 --> 06:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
to answer a question you know
 
06:40:22.868 --> 06:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
would our founders be proud of this
 
06:40:22.878 --> 06:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
would our founders be proud of this
initiative

06:40:23.990 --> 06:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
06:40:25.670 --> 06:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
i would say they would be this is what
 
06:40:27.270 --> 06:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's intended to be we're peacefully
 
06:40:28.548 --> 06:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
getting together we're having a
 
06:40:30.150 --> 06:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
discussion about something that's very
 
06:40:32.468 --> 06:40:32.478 align:start position:0%
important to us and to our children
 
06:40:32.478 --> 06:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
important to us and to our children
um

06:40:33.510 --> 06:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:36.548 --> 06:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
and uh i i want to go back i'm just got
 
06:40:38.150 --> 06:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
a couple things out of the declaration
 
06:40:42.150 --> 06:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:43.830 --> 06:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
we we know the section about life
 
06:40:46.468 --> 06:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
liberty and the pursuit of happiness
 
06:40:48.230 --> 06:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
that to secure these rights governments
 
06:40:50.230 --> 06:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
are instituted among men
 
06:40:52.548 --> 06:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
deriving their just powers the just
 
06:40:55.190 --> 06:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
powers from the consent of the govern
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
that whenever any form of government
 
06:40:59.590 --> 06:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
becomes destructive of these ends it is
 
06:41:01.590 --> 06:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
the right of the people to alter it or
 
06:41:04.230 --> 06:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
to abolish it i think that's the spirit
 
06:41:07.030 --> 06:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
of why we're having this discussion
 
06:41:10.310 --> 06:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
but as i continue of independence i find
 
06:41:13.830 --> 06:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:15.990 --> 06:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
in our founding fathers
 
06:41:18.868 --> 06:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
that should speak to us in this moment
 
06:41:18.878 --> 06:41:19.910 align:start position:0%
that should speak to us in this moment
also

06:41:19.910 --> 06:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:41:21.270 --> 06:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
06:41:23.910 --> 06:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
that prudence indeed
 
06:41:25.990 --> 06:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
will dictate that governments long
 
06:41:28.948 --> 06:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
established should not be changed for
 
06:41:31.670 --> 06:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
light and transient causes and
 
06:41:34.628 --> 06:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
accordingly all experience has shown
 
06:41:38.788 --> 06:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
that mankind are more disposed to suffer
 
06:41:41.590 --> 06:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
while evils are sufferable than to write
 
06:41:43.990 --> 06:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
themselves by abolishing the forms to
 
06:41:47.350 --> 06:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
which they are accustomed
 
06:41:50.230 --> 06:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
so in my assessment of where the
 
06:41:52.468 --> 06:41:52.478 align:start position:0%
american society is
 
06:41:54.868 --> 06:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
and where it's going
 
06:41:56.868 --> 06:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
06:41:59.430 --> 06:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's a sense in the population of new
 
06:41:59.440 --> 06:42:00.548 align:start position:0%
there's a sense in the population of new
hampshire

06:42:00.548 --> 06:42:00.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:42:04.390 --> 06:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
that the evils that were subjected to by
 
06:42:06.150 --> 06:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
an excessive government federal
 
06:42:06.160 --> 06:42:07.270 align:start position:0%
an excessive government federal
government

06:42:07.270 --> 06:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:42:08.868 --> 06:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
are insufferable
 
06:42:11.830 --> 06:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
and so i i just don't see
 
06:42:14.150 --> 06:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
um a public will
 
06:42:16.830 --> 06:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
to to support this if there were to be a
 
06:42:21.030 --> 06:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
vote and since i get to vote on this as
 
06:42:22.548 --> 06:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
well as a member of the house of
 
06:42:22.558 --> 06:42:24.390 align:start position:0%
well as a member of the house of
representatives

06:42:24.390 --> 06:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
06:42:27.030 --> 06:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to be on record now as
 
06:42:30.150 --> 06:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
saying i will vote no and i i hope this
 
06:42:33.430 --> 06:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
comes out itl out of the committee and i
 
06:42:36.150 --> 06:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
would hope that not because this is some
 
06:42:38.548 --> 06:42:38.558 align:start position:0%
kind of an illegitimate scary
 
06:42:38.558 --> 06:42:40.070 align:start position:0%
kind of an illegitimate scary
conversation

06:42:40.070 --> 06:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
06:42:42.788 --> 06:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
but just because um
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
i i just don't think that this is really
 
06:42:48.548 --> 06:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the conscious
 
06:42:52.230 --> 06:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
consciousness of the majority of our
 
06:42:54.468 --> 06:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
citizens it's it's it's certainly
 
06:42:57.110 --> 06:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
premature and i wouldn't put a timeline
 
06:42:58.150 --> 06:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
on when
 
06:43:01.670 --> 06:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
it will become ripe i i haven't given up
 
06:43:03.990 --> 06:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
on the great american experiment
 
06:43:06.070 --> 06:43:06.080 align:start position:0%

06:43:09.990 --> 06:43:10.000 align:start position:0%

online to this committee of the
legislative

06:44:15.830 --> 06:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
06:44:18.270 --> 06:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
section of that are there any
 
06:44:21.590 --> 06:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
06:44:21.600 --> 06:44:26.390 align:start position:0%
questions for
representatives

06:44:26.390 --> 06:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:28.548 --> 06:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:44:32.070 --> 06:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:34.468 --> 06:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
if we were to put this on the ballot for
 
06:44:36.628 --> 06:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
the people to vote on
 
06:44:40.708 --> 06:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that show the
 
06:44:43.590 --> 06:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
desire of the people i mean if there
 
06:44:45.910 --> 06:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
were the majority of the people here in
 
06:44:48.788 --> 06:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
the state who actually did vote
 
06:44:50.628 --> 06:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
for secession from
 
06:44:52.708 --> 06:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
06:44:55.270 --> 06:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be the voice of the people
 
06:44:57.990 --> 06:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
by allowing to have that that on the
 
06:45:01.910 --> 06:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:03.030 --> 06:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think
 
06:45:04.708 --> 06:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
that's an exceptionally fair question
 
06:45:06.390 --> 06:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
and one that i've had to think about as
 
06:45:09.430 --> 06:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
i've been lobbied on this and i i as
 
06:45:12.708 --> 06:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
i've come to look at it is the process
 
06:45:14.948 --> 06:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
under which we amend the new hampshire
 
06:45:17.350 --> 06:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
constitution is not meant to be easy it
 
06:45:21.750 --> 06:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
requires a a series of separate steps
 
06:45:24.150 --> 06:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
all of which have to be in alignment and
 
06:45:26.948 --> 06:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
an agreement in order to pass
 
06:45:30.708 --> 06:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
and as a as a representative of
 
06:45:32.948 --> 06:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
3 400 people
 
06:45:35.110 --> 06:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
i would vote
 
06:45:39.670 --> 06:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh to not put this on the ballot in 2022
 
06:45:42.548 --> 06:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
um and and i think i get a vote too my
 
06:45:44.468 --> 06:45:44.478 align:start position:0%
vote as a representative is part of the
 
06:45:46.628 --> 06:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
process and that's where i'm at
 
06:45:48.788 --> 06:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
um i would just say
 
06:45:50.868 --> 06:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:45:50.878 --> 06:45:52.468 align:start position:0%
that um
2022

06:45:52.468 --> 06:45:52.478 align:start position:0%
2022
 
06:45:55.270 --> 06:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
i think is a pivotal election for new
 
06:45:55.280 --> 06:45:56.390 align:start position:0%
i think is a pivotal election for new
hampshire

06:45:56.390 --> 06:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:45:58.390 --> 06:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh and for the country
 
06:45:58.400 --> 06:46:00.150 align:start position:0%
uh and for the country
and

06:46:00.150 --> 06:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:46:03.030 --> 06:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
i from a political perspective
 
06:46:07.830 --> 06:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm just uh also very concerned that
 
06:46:11.510 --> 06:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
we we muddy the waters with you know
 
06:46:14.070 --> 06:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
insurrectionist talk and the like and
 
06:46:17.670 --> 06:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
that rather than being taken seriously
 
06:46:17.680 --> 06:46:19.510 align:start position:0%
that rather than being taken seriously
we

06:46:19.510 --> 06:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:46:21.270 --> 06:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
open up
 
06:46:23.430 --> 06:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves to national media and local
 
06:46:25.430 --> 06:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
media to just make a mockery of the
 
06:46:27.030 --> 06:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
whole exercise and
 
06:46:29.430 --> 06:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
that'll be a setback in my view that's
 
06:46:31.910 --> 06:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
why i'm another reason i'm voting no i i
 
06:46:35.590 --> 06:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:37.750 --> 06:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:46:39.830 --> 06:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:46:41.990 --> 06:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
taking my follow-up question
 
06:46:44.468 --> 06:46:44.478 align:start position:0%
is legitimately is this one of the steps
 
06:46:46.788 --> 06:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
though i mean would would getting this
 
06:46:49.030 --> 06:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
is is coming to this
 
06:46:49.040 --> 06:46:50.150 align:start position:0%
is is coming to this
committee

06:46:50.150 --> 06:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:46:53.430 --> 06:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
and dealing with this uh cacr
 
06:46:55.270 --> 06:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
is isn't this one of the steps that
 
06:46:57.270 --> 06:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
would be taken
 
06:46:57.280 --> 06:47:00.468 align:start position:0%
would be taken
uh

06:47:00.468 --> 06:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:03.990 --> 06:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely i i i have come in my
 
06:47:06.150 --> 06:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
five years here to really believe in the
 
06:47:08.788 --> 06:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
process and the committee processes is
 
06:47:11.990 --> 06:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
is critical to everything uh the house
 
06:47:13.670 --> 06:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
produces and so
 
06:47:16.948 --> 06:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
your independent uh determination with
 
06:47:20.310 --> 06:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
within this committee is is is important
 
06:47:22.708 --> 06:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
and i i hope that you do it with all the
 
06:47:25.270 --> 06:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
deliberation uh and discretion that is
 
06:47:27.110 --> 06:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the question
 
06:47:29.430 --> 06:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i i also want to thank you
 
06:47:31.670 --> 06:47:31.680 align:start position:0%

edwards
 
06:47:44.070 --> 06:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh i'm now looking at representative
 
06:47:53.350 --> 06:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:00.150 --> 06:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:01.510 --> 06:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you to the members of the
 
06:48:03.270 --> 06:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
committee for letting me speak today so
 
06:48:05.350 --> 06:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
um i assume many of you have seen my uh
 
06:48:07.590 --> 06:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
i sent a letter to the committee a while
 
06:48:09.270 --> 06:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
back i just distributed again to the
 
06:48:11.590 --> 06:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
committee members um sections of that
 
06:48:12.628 --> 06:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
letter were published in the new
 
06:48:14.150 --> 06:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire journal regarding the
 
06:48:16.628 --> 06:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues behind this but um
 
06:48:18.708 --> 06:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
i just want to kind of deconstruct real
 
06:48:19.910 --> 06:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
quick because the letter
 
06:48:21.190 --> 06:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
for the most part i think almost
 
06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
everyone in the room has read the letter
 
06:48:24.070 --> 06:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
right and there are some people who are
 
06:48:25.590 --> 06:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
very upset with me in the room which i
 
06:48:28.390 --> 06:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
can perfectly well understand but um
 
06:48:29.590 --> 06:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know after speaking to
 
06:48:31.270 --> 06:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional scholars i didn't do this
 
06:48:32.868 --> 06:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum right i reached out to
 
06:48:34.468 --> 06:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
constitutional scholars i'll actually uh
 
06:48:36.468 --> 06:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
cite one right now who i spoke with this
 
06:48:37.830 --> 06:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
week who's an expert one of the
 
06:48:40.150 --> 06:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
international experts in uh this kind of
 
06:48:43.270 --> 06:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
issue is dr david williams uh he's the
 
06:48:45.430 --> 06:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
head of the john s hastings professor of
 
06:48:46.948 --> 06:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
law executive director of the center for
 
06:48:49.430 --> 06:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional democracy actually sort
 
06:48:51.110 --> 06:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
of ironically why i found him to be the
 
06:48:51.120 --> 06:48:52.150 align:start position:0%
of ironically why i found him to be the
best

06:48:52.150 --> 06:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
best
 
06:48:54.230 --> 06:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
scholar for this is that he aids
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
secessionist movements in revolt
 
06:48:57.910 --> 06:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
movements in foreign countries and how
 
06:49:00.788 --> 06:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
to develop constitutions so i wanted to
 
06:49:02.868 --> 06:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
kind of get an understanding of how he
 
06:49:04.390 --> 06:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
felt that this would fit in
 
06:49:06.310 --> 06:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
to our constitutional process here in
 
06:49:07.750 --> 06:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and nationally right
 
06:49:09.030 --> 06:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
because this does have national
 
06:49:11.430 --> 06:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
ramifications um and that kind of you
 
06:49:13.270 --> 06:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
know that will enter into my first point
 
06:49:16.230 --> 06:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
here this is not a referendum right this
 
06:49:18.310 --> 06:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
is a constitutional process right we've
 
06:49:21.110 --> 06:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
just begun on a constitutional process
 
06:49:23.190 --> 06:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
with this hearing today and it's it's
 
06:49:24.548 --> 06:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
great it's great that we're entering
 
06:49:26.788 --> 06:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
into a constitutional process it's the
 
06:49:28.310 --> 06:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature who propose
 
06:49:29.910 --> 06:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
this it's their right the people have
 
06:49:31.430 --> 06:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
come here to testify and support her
 
06:49:33.190 --> 06:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
against it's their right but we have to
 
06:49:35.030 --> 06:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
remember this is a constitutional
 
06:49:38.150 --> 06:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
process every vote cast is aiding in
 
06:49:40.390 --> 06:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
that constitutional process by putting
 
06:49:41.990 --> 06:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
this on the ballot
 
06:49:43.990 --> 06:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're it's the process is a whole thing
 
06:49:45.670 --> 06:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
right it's not like we we prepared to
 
06:49:48.070 --> 06:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
get onto the ballot and then that's when
 
06:49:49.590 --> 06:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
we approve or disapprove of the
 
06:49:51.030 --> 06:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment we're approving
 
06:49:53.830 --> 06:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
it each time along the way right so
 
06:49:55.990 --> 06:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're not this is not a mere referendum
 
06:49:57.590 --> 06:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
we are embarking on a constitutional
 
06:49:59.670 --> 06:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
process and every vote for it has
 
06:50:01.830 --> 06:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional ramifications right
 
06:50:04.548 --> 06:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
judging by amendment 14
 
06:50:07.190 --> 06:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the us constitution section 3.
 
06:50:09.270 --> 06:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
right some scholars would argue that
 
06:50:11.110 --> 06:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
this is rebellion right you are
 
06:50:13.190 --> 06:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
rebelling against even if it's peaceful
 
06:50:15.750 --> 06:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
right rebellion can be peaceful children
 
06:50:17.750 --> 06:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
peacefully rebel against their parents
 
06:50:21.590 --> 06:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
every day right so even still we we you
 
06:50:23.510 --> 06:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to we have to you know take
 
06:50:25.190 --> 06:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
we have to get back from the 30-foot
 
06:50:27.190 --> 06:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
view and look at the 3000 foot view
 
06:50:29.030 --> 06:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
right um
 
06:50:30.948 --> 06:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
this very well could be an argument
 
06:50:33.190 --> 06:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
where you know if if voting for this
 
06:50:35.510 --> 06:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
even if it's a good idea right and even
 
06:50:37.190 --> 06:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
if people believe in their heart that
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
they should be voting for this even if
 
06:50:39.990 --> 06:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
people say they don't support it but
 
06:50:41.510 --> 06:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
they want to give people the choice
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
aiding and abetting in that process
 
06:50:45.350 --> 06:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
right could very arguably be
 
06:50:47.670 --> 06:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional right now it's a pretty
 
06:50:50.548 --> 06:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
open-ended question still
 
06:50:52.548 --> 06:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
but the next part i'll mention is um
 
06:50:53.670 --> 06:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there's gonna be a lot of
 
06:50:54.708 --> 06:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
talk about the new hampshire state
 
06:50:57.110 --> 06:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
constitution right specifically part one
 
06:50:59.830 --> 06:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
article seven in part one article 10. so
 
06:51:01.750 --> 06:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
let's address part one article uh
 
06:51:04.310 --> 06:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
article seven so new hampshire is a
 
06:51:06.390 --> 06:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
sovereign state right we are still
 
06:51:06.400 --> 06:51:07.830 align:start position:0%
sovereign state right we are still
sovereign

06:51:07.830 --> 06:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
sovereign
 
06:51:09.430 --> 06:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
now we are not an independent nation
 
06:51:11.750 --> 06:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're not a sovereign nation right but
 
06:51:13.030 --> 06:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the way that this constitutional
 
06:51:15.350 --> 06:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is written it implies it's
 
06:51:17.030 --> 06:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
using the word sovereignty in the modern
 
06:51:18.788 --> 06:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
sense it's not using it in the original
 
06:51:20.468 --> 06:51:20.478 align:start position:0%
sense of the framers right the framers
 
06:51:21.670 --> 06:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
kind of viewed sovereign as that there
 
06:51:23.350 --> 06:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
was a number of things that an entity
 
06:51:25.430 --> 06:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
could be sovereign over right now
 
06:51:27.030 --> 06:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
they're very it's very explicit in our
 
06:51:28.548 --> 06:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
federal constitution which the state of
 
06:51:31.110 --> 06:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire ratified and joined into
 
06:51:32.548 --> 06:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
right and we were already part of a
 
06:51:34.230 --> 06:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
perpetual union when we ratified and
 
06:51:35.590 --> 06:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
entered into the articles of
 
06:51:38.468 --> 06:51:38.478 align:start position:0%
confederation and perpetual union right
 
06:51:39.990 --> 06:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
we always drop that last section the
 
06:51:41.110 --> 06:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
whole name of the document is the
 
06:51:43.110 --> 06:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
articles of confederation and perpetual
 
06:51:45.830 --> 06:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
union established in 1777
 
06:51:47.910 --> 06:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
but um when new hampshire entered into
 
06:51:49.670 --> 06:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
the constitution when we created our own
 
06:51:51.830 --> 06:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
constitution as the prime sponsor
 
06:51:54.150 --> 06:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned we established that we are
 
06:51:55.190 --> 06:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
sovereign the point of that was to
 
06:51:56.548 --> 06:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
establish that we are sovereign over
 
06:51:58.150 --> 06:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
everything within our borders and that's
 
06:52:00.150 --> 06:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
within our purview based on what's not
 
06:52:01.270 --> 06:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the federal
 
06:52:02.548 --> 06:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
government now many people bring up a
 
06:52:04.788 --> 06:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
great point here right that the federal
 
06:52:06.948 --> 06:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
government has you know we've ceded
 
06:52:08.390 --> 06:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
right a number of powers to the federal
 
06:52:09.510 --> 06:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
government that we probably shouldn't
 
06:52:10.628 --> 06:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
have ceded
 
06:52:10.638 --> 06:52:11.350 align:start position:0%
have ceded
but

06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:52:12.628 --> 06:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
even still we did that through the
 
06:52:15.510 --> 06:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
sovereign process right so article
 
06:52:17.190 --> 06:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
specifically you look at article 1
 
06:52:19.110 --> 06:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
section 8 of the us constitution that
 
06:52:20.628 --> 06:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
cites what powers the federal government
 
06:52:22.548 --> 06:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
has and then the u.s constitution is
 
06:52:24.628 --> 06:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
very explicit with the bill of rights
 
06:52:26.548 --> 06:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
right the 10th amendment everything else
 
06:52:28.310 --> 06:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
is left with the people sorry everything
 
06:52:31.030 --> 06:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
else is left with the state governments
 
06:52:32.788 --> 06:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
amendment 9 says everything that's not
 
06:52:34.150 --> 06:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the state governments is left to the
 
06:52:34.160 --> 06:52:35.110 align:start position:0%
in the state governments is left to the
people

06:52:35.110 --> 06:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:52:36.468 --> 06:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
so we have to remember that right so new
 
06:52:38.150 --> 06:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire is still sovereign and has
 
06:52:41.270 --> 06:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
control over a myriad of specific issues
 
06:52:42.948 --> 06:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
and whatever the federal government
 
06:52:44.310 --> 06:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have responsibility for and
 
06:52:45.430 --> 06:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the state government doesn't
 
06:52:47.430 --> 06:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
have responsibility for that is reserved
 
06:52:49.030 --> 06:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
to the people now new hampshire's
 
06:52:51.030 --> 06:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
constitution is an agreement between new
 
06:52:52.788 --> 06:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire's residents
 
06:52:52.798 --> 06:52:54.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire's residents
and

06:52:54.070 --> 06:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:52:55.670 --> 06:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
the state government
 
06:52:57.430 --> 06:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
some will assert today maybe that part 1
 
06:52:59.350 --> 06:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
article 10 applies and this is the
 
06:53:02.230 --> 06:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
revolutionary amendment sorry article in
 
06:53:04.310 --> 06:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
our state bill of rights some will
 
06:53:05.910 --> 06:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
assert today that part when article 10
 
06:53:07.670 --> 06:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
applies to the federal government it
 
06:53:09.510 --> 06:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
does not
 
06:53:10.868 --> 06:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
we have a right to revolution in
 
06:53:12.868 --> 06:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances but the new
 
06:53:14.948 --> 06:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution does not confer a
 
06:53:16.788 --> 06:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
right to revolution against the u.s
 
06:53:19.430 --> 06:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
government or the u.s constitution
 
06:53:19.440 --> 06:53:20.230 align:start position:0%
government or the u.s constitution
right

06:53:20.230 --> 06:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:53:21.910 --> 06:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
the us constitution is pretty explicit
 
06:53:23.590 --> 06:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
about what happens you know
 
06:53:26.150 --> 06:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
that regarding you know amendment 14
 
06:53:28.468 --> 06:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
section three right we had a civil war
 
06:53:30.070 --> 06:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
it kind of was de facto established
 
06:53:31.510 --> 06:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
right revolution against the federal
 
06:53:33.510 --> 06:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
government isn't constitutionally
 
06:53:33.520 --> 06:53:34.628 align:start position:0%
government isn't constitutionally
allowed

06:53:34.628 --> 06:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
06:53:37.030 --> 06:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
so now we can revolt theoretically
 
06:53:38.708 --> 06:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
against our state government right our
 
06:53:39.990 --> 06:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
state has you know pretty much
 
06:53:41.670 --> 06:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
recognized and is securing that right
 
06:53:44.390 --> 06:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
through governance but um we don't have
 
06:53:46.150 --> 06:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
a right to revolt against our federal
 
06:53:48.070 --> 06:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
government right the state constitution
 
06:53:49.910 --> 06:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
is not an agreement that would include
 
06:53:51.430 --> 06:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government it's separate
 
06:53:53.350 --> 06:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
right we have an agreement the people
 
06:53:55.430 --> 06:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
between the federal government with our
 
06:53:57.190 --> 06:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
us constitution we have agreement the
 
06:53:58.948 --> 06:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
people between the state government with
 
06:54:01.590 --> 06:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
our state constitution
 
06:54:03.510 --> 06:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
and one last time because i kind of
 
06:54:05.510 --> 06:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned it just briefly before this
 
06:54:07.830 --> 06:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
but um remember new hampshire lost many
 
06:54:08.788 --> 06:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
of the powers that people are
 
06:54:10.830 --> 06:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
complaining about today and many of the
 
06:54:12.948 --> 06:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
concerns and we lost some of that
 
06:54:12.958 --> 06:54:15.030 align:start position:0%
concerns and we lost some of that
sovereignty

06:54:15.030 --> 06:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
sovereignty
 
06:54:17.030 --> 06:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
because we accepted federal dollars and
 
06:54:19.110 --> 06:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
we seeded a number of responsibilities
 
06:54:20.948 --> 06:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
right now we're still sovereign
 
06:54:22.868 --> 06:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
technically over this right we can
 
06:54:24.468 --> 06:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
through the constitutional process
 
06:54:26.868 --> 06:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
freely take back those powers it just
 
06:54:28.070 --> 06:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
means we're going to have to be giving
 
06:54:31.110 --> 06:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
up the carrots right we took the carrot
 
06:54:32.468 --> 06:54:32.478 align:start position:0%
we get the stick
 
06:54:34.390 --> 06:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
we could also vice versa say we don't
 
06:54:35.670 --> 06:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
want the stick but that means we're
 
06:54:37.350 --> 06:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
giving up the carrot
 
06:54:39.510 --> 06:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i think um to kind of look at that in
 
06:54:41.430 --> 06:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
the context and after speaking to a
 
06:54:43.750 --> 06:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
number of constitutional scholars i felt
 
06:54:45.670 --> 06:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
as if it would be against my oath of
 
06:54:47.990 --> 06:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
office because i when i take an oath
 
06:54:49.270 --> 06:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's not only an oath to our state
 
06:54:51.110 --> 06:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
constitution it's also an oath to our
 
06:54:53.270 --> 06:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
federal one last thing
 
06:54:56.468 --> 06:54:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:58.390 --> 06:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to this in case it would be
 
06:54:58.400 --> 06:55:00.230 align:start position:0%
amendment to this in case it would be
necessary

06:55:00.230 --> 06:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
06:55:02.628 --> 06:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
i'm going to read and i i have the votes
 
06:55:04.230 --> 06:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
to get it passed
 
06:55:06.150 --> 06:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
right i'm pretty confident such i'm
 
06:55:07.510 --> 06:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
going to read what it would change the
 
06:55:07.520 --> 06:55:09.270 align:start position:0%
going to read what it would change the
language

06:55:09.270 --> 06:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:55:10.948 --> 06:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
quote new hampshire shall never declare
 
06:55:12.708 --> 06:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
independence from the united states nor
 
06:55:14.788 --> 06:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
unilaterally leave
 
06:55:16.948 --> 06:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
the union of states first established by
 
06:55:19.750 --> 06:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
the articles of confederation in 1777
 
06:55:21.190 --> 06:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
and superseded by the united states
 
06:55:23.590 --> 06:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
constitution in 1789.
 
06:55:25.830 --> 06:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment this kind of language was
 
06:55:27.190 --> 06:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
very similar to what other states
 
06:55:29.110 --> 06:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
adopted after the civil war
 
06:55:29.120 --> 06:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
adopted after the civil war
right

06:55:29.990 --> 06:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:55:31.830 --> 06:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's a very normal thing that states
 
06:55:33.430 --> 06:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
have done it does not mean that we're
 
06:55:36.310 --> 06:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
giving up our sovereignty what it means
 
06:55:37.750 --> 06:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that we're recognizing the federal
 
06:55:39.510 --> 06:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
government's sovereignty over specific
 
06:55:42.150 --> 06:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
issues that is quite clear in the u.s
 
06:55:42.160 --> 06:55:43.430 align:start position:0%
issues that is quite clear in the u.s
constitution

06:55:43.430 --> 06:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:55:45.670 --> 06:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
right our state entered into that u.s
 
06:55:47.110 --> 06:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
constitution we entered into this
 
06:55:49.270 --> 06:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
perpetual union it's just recognizing
 
06:55:50.788 --> 06:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
that our state
 
06:55:52.628 --> 06:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
would still recognize that perpetual
 
06:55:55.510 --> 06:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
union right that the u.s constitution is
 
06:55:57.430 --> 06:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
and the u.s government is a legitimate
 
06:56:00.310 --> 06:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
authority and that we are co-shares of
 
06:56:02.628 --> 06:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
sovereignty with the federal government
 
06:56:04.788 --> 06:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
right we share authority we share
 
06:56:07.270 --> 06:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
agreements with the people and we look
 
06:56:09.190 --> 06:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
to the consent of the governed
 
06:56:10.868 --> 06:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
because ultimately the power lies with
 
06:56:13.350 --> 06:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
the people and uh with that i'll remain
 
06:56:15.270 --> 06:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
open to any questions thank you well
 
06:56:17.590 --> 06:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shea i'm i'm
 
06:56:19.110 --> 06:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
glad that's why i gave you a little bit
 
06:56:21.910 --> 06:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
of more leeway on speaking forward and
 
06:56:24.390 --> 06:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
i've asked you to do some research for
 
06:56:27.270 --> 06:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
us and you've done a great job on it and
 
06:56:28.868 --> 06:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that concerns me
 
06:56:30.788 --> 06:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
with this here
 
06:56:34.070 --> 06:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have refuelling airplanes down in um
 
06:56:35.910 --> 06:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
at pease there they refuel the coast
 
06:56:38.310 --> 06:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
there and they do refueling for for the
 
06:56:40.548 --> 06:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
security of the coast what will happen
 
06:56:41.910 --> 06:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
to all them aircraft there and now
 
06:56:44.628 --> 06:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
security on the coast
 
06:56:44.638 --> 06:56:45.670 align:start position:0%
security on the coast
well

06:56:45.670 --> 06:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:56:47.830 --> 06:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know this is kind of i in my opinion
 
06:56:49.030 --> 06:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't even get to that question
 
06:56:50.230 --> 06:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
because the federal government wouldn't
 
06:56:52.230 --> 06:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
allow us to leave
 
06:56:53.990 --> 06:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
right that would
 
06:56:55.750 --> 06:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
it would it would be it would be a moot
 
06:56:58.070 --> 06:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
question if i may i'd appreciate if you
 
06:57:00.548 --> 06:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
let uh no i i appreciate the sentiment
 
06:57:02.788 --> 06:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
how are we well the u.s constitution is
 
06:57:04.628 --> 06:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
quite clear right that the federal
 
06:57:07.030 --> 06:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
government is responsible over defenses
 
06:57:09.830 --> 06:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
right and so we we wouldn't you know
 
06:57:11.910 --> 06:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
there would be absolutely no way for us
 
06:57:13.750 --> 06:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
to first leave the union right we can't
 
06:57:15.750 --> 06:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't rebel against the
 
06:57:18.150 --> 06:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
union right that's that's pretty clear
 
06:57:19.750 --> 06:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
right state lawmakers can't rebel
 
06:57:21.430 --> 06:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
against the union it's in our it's in
 
06:57:23.350 --> 06:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
our u.s constitution can you hold one
 
06:57:25.030 --> 06:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
second representative can you please no
 
06:57:27.030 --> 06:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
signs in my committee room
 
06:57:29.190 --> 06:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
can you i i understand uh we have a
 
06:57:31.350 --> 06:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and our rules here
 
06:57:34.548 --> 06:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
no signs thank you okay go ahead yeah so
 
06:57:35.910 --> 06:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
i mean back to your question though you
 
06:57:37.910 --> 06:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
know how would that work um
 
06:57:39.590 --> 06:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
well the federal government would be
 
06:57:39.600 --> 06:57:41.350 align:start position:0%
well the federal government would be
under

06:57:41.350 --> 06:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:57:42.868 --> 06:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
if something's unconstitutional the
 
06:57:43.830 --> 06:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
federal government's not going to
 
06:57:45.590 --> 06:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
recognize it as legitimate right and
 
06:57:47.190 --> 06:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what we get to the whole
 
06:57:49.270 --> 06:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
issue of this right is that the federal
 
06:57:50.788 --> 06:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
government isn't going to entertain this
 
06:57:52.628 --> 06:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
for even a second at least from my from
 
06:57:54.390 --> 06:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
my perspective and from what i've read
 
06:57:55.270 --> 06:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
from what i've talked to with
 
06:57:57.030 --> 06:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional scholars right and i
 
06:57:58.230 --> 06:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
think it's quite clear just with the
 
06:57:59.590 --> 06:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
legal press and that's the fact to
 
06:58:02.310 --> 06:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
establish with the civil war right
 
06:58:04.070 --> 06:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
i mean it was abraham it was abraham
 
06:58:05.670 --> 06:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
lincoln who
 
06:58:08.390 --> 06:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know a republican who quite frankly
 
06:58:09.830 --> 06:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
recognized that you know we're in a
 
06:58:12.230 --> 06:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
perpetual union right in the civil war
 
06:58:14.070 --> 06:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
before the civil war this was a
 
06:58:16.070 --> 06:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionally open you know question
 
06:58:17.190 --> 06:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about it right there
 
06:58:18.948 --> 06:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
was still a lot of legal debate after
 
06:58:21.270 --> 06:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
the civil war and with um in my
 
06:58:23.670 --> 06:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
testimonial read that i mentioned
 
06:58:25.350 --> 06:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
texas versus white
 
06:58:27.030 --> 06:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's pretty you know and this president
 
06:58:30.230 --> 06:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
has been upheld right it's pretty clear
 
06:58:32.150 --> 06:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
the the the union of states was
 
06:58:33.510 --> 06:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
established when he came together as
 
06:58:35.990 --> 06:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
colonies to rebel against the king right
 
06:58:38.310 --> 06:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
king george iii in the crown we
 
06:58:39.350 --> 06:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
established the articles of
 
06:58:40.948 --> 06:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
confederation and when we all entered
 
06:58:42.708 --> 06:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
into that as states
 
06:58:44.948 --> 06:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
it was a perpetual union and then we
 
06:58:47.350 --> 06:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
made that union more perfect when we
 
06:58:50.150 --> 06:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
adopted the u.s constitution right a
 
06:58:52.070 --> 06:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
more perfect union implying everything
 
06:58:53.270 --> 06:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
else that was perfect about the
 
06:58:55.590 --> 06:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
article's confederation plus everything
 
06:58:56.788 --> 06:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
that we're perfecting and we're still
 
06:58:59.670 --> 06:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
perfecting right this
 
06:59:01.830 --> 06:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
this issue i think people are misguided
 
06:59:03.750 --> 06:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
and they're providing an answer to an
 
06:59:05.510 --> 06:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
issue that isn't the right answer that
 
06:59:08.070 --> 06:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
isn't the constitutional answer right
 
06:59:09.350 --> 06:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're trying to work outside of
 
06:59:11.190 --> 06:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional government to get this
 
06:59:13.190 --> 06:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
done we have a we have a set way of
 
06:59:14.948 --> 06:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
doing things and
 
06:59:16.230 --> 06:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know we should push back against a
 
06:59:17.910 --> 06:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
lot of this overreach and we've seen our
 
06:59:19.590 --> 06:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
governor push back against a lot of the
 
06:59:21.430 --> 06:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
overreach from washington too
 
06:59:23.430 --> 06:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i think i think we're working as hard
 
06:59:25.110 --> 06:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
as we can as state lawmakers but i
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
understand some people you know
 
06:59:29.510 --> 06:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
will never see eye to eye on this issue
 
06:59:31.830 --> 06:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
no i agree with you i got one last uh
 
06:59:33.510 --> 06:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
question here of course i've been on
 
06:59:35.830 --> 06:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
this committee for 15 years and you're
 
06:59:37.590 --> 06:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
all there laughing or whatever when
 
06:59:38.868 --> 06:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
you're speaking or when we're talking
 
06:59:40.708 --> 06:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
this year i can tell you right now my
 
06:59:43.270 --> 06:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
voting record is the liberty rep for 15
 
06:59:43.280 --> 06:59:44.150 align:start position:0%
voting record is the liberty rep for 15
years

06:59:44.150 --> 06:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:59:44.160 --> 06:59:45.030 align:start position:0%
years
so

06:59:45.030 --> 06:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:59:47.030 --> 06:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
have respect for uh whoever's speaking
 
06:59:49.350 --> 06:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
up there and i appreciate it but anyways
 
06:59:51.190 --> 06:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
um under the constitution i've been
 
06:59:53.110 --> 06:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
carrying it for years as you see they're
 
06:59:55.750 --> 06:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
warned new hampshire and the u.s
 
06:59:57.830 --> 06:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
constitution so that's like i said why
 
06:59:57.840 --> 06:59:58.868 align:start position:0%
constitution so that's like i said why
yes

06:59:58.868 --> 06:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:00:01.910 --> 07:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
under the commerce law under trade and i
 
07:00:03.750 --> 07:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
know you've been researching this for a
 
07:00:03.760 --> 07:00:04.548 align:start position:0%
know you've been researching this for a
while

07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
while
 
07:00:06.150 --> 07:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
what happens to the state of new
 
07:00:08.948 --> 07:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire on our commerce
 
07:00:10.708 --> 07:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
well i mean that's even it's even
 
07:00:12.150 --> 07:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
outside of just the commerce clause the
 
07:00:13.430 --> 07:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
issue is let's say let's say
 
07:00:15.590 --> 07:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
theoretically let's entertain it that um
 
07:00:17.350 --> 07:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire somehow in some way
 
07:00:19.830 --> 07:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
managed to convince 70 percent of voters
 
07:00:21.670 --> 07:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the majority of the legislature to
 
07:00:24.070 --> 07:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
leave to leave the union and to give up
 
07:00:25.510 --> 07:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know everything that comes that
 
07:00:27.110 --> 07:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
entails in the union um
 
07:00:28.868 --> 07:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
we'd be leaving the largest free trade
 
07:00:30.948 --> 07:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
bloc in the world quite frankly we'd be
 
07:00:33.030 --> 07:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
crippling our economy the 15 to 20
 
07:00:34.868 --> 07:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
percent of workers who cross the border
 
07:00:36.070 --> 07:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
every day wouldn't be able to the
 
07:00:37.670 --> 07:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
federal government wouldn't recognize us
 
07:00:39.110 --> 07:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't recognize any passports
 
07:00:40.628 --> 07:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
that we issue they wouldn't let them out
 
07:00:41.590 --> 07:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't have an
 
07:00:43.430 --> 07:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
international airport there's no way to
 
07:00:45.270 --> 07:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
travel internationally not to mention
 
07:00:47.110 --> 07:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
the united states probably would not let
 
07:00:49.270 --> 07:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
any other country in the world recognize
 
07:00:49.280 --> 07:00:50.070 align:start position:0%
any other country in the world recognize
us

07:00:50.070 --> 07:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
us
 
07:00:51.670 --> 07:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
right we wouldn't be recognized in the
 
07:00:53.110 --> 07:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
international stage we would become a
 
07:00:55.270 --> 07:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
hermit republic we'd become a hermit
 
07:00:57.750 --> 07:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
republic in a large and globalizing
 
07:00:59.670 --> 07:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
world we would kill our economy we'd
 
07:01:01.590 --> 07:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
kill the new hampshire advantage this is
 
07:01:03.270 --> 07:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
a one-way ticket
 
07:01:05.190 --> 07:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
to a sales tax and an income tax in my
 
07:01:06.788 --> 07:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
opinion how else are you going to
 
07:01:08.548 --> 07:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
support the current programs that we
 
07:01:10.948 --> 07:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
have in this state and you know i'm not
 
07:01:12.310 --> 07:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
saying the federal government's perfect
 
07:01:13.990 --> 07:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room knows the federal
 
07:01:15.590 --> 07:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
government is far from perfect right
 
07:01:18.070 --> 07:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
democrats republicans libertarians
 
07:01:21.590 --> 07:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
anarchists whatever have you right
 
07:01:21.600 --> 07:01:22.628 align:start position:0%
anarchists whatever have you right
but

07:01:22.628 --> 07:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:01:24.628 --> 07:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we
 
07:01:27.030 --> 07:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
we can as legislators we can't push
 
07:01:30.150 --> 07:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
forward unconstitutional um
 
07:01:30.160 --> 07:01:31.430 align:start position:0%
forward unconstitutional um
legislation

07:01:31.430 --> 07:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:01:33.830 --> 07:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
right especially something like this and
 
07:01:35.990 --> 07:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
i you know i say that in the most in the
 
07:01:38.468 --> 07:01:38.478 align:start position:0%
most respect that i can have for those
 
07:01:39.670 --> 07:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
who have brought this forward because i
 
07:01:41.670 --> 07:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a very good discussion to
 
07:01:43.990 --> 07:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
have about what the role is of state
 
07:01:46.468 --> 07:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
government within this federalist system
 
07:01:48.390 --> 07:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
what the role is of you know
 
07:01:50.310 --> 07:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
how states can you know how they how
 
07:01:51.670 --> 07:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
they associate and how they associate
 
07:01:52.708 --> 07:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
with the federal government how this
 
07:01:54.390 --> 07:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
issue of sovereignty works i think it's
 
07:01:56.070 --> 07:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
a great learning experience but i also
 
07:01:56.080 --> 07:01:58.310 align:start position:0%
a great learning experience but i also
think

07:01:58.310 --> 07:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:00.708 --> 07:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
i think it's opening up a can of worms
 
07:02:03.590 --> 07:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we basically close at appomattox in
 
07:02:03.600 --> 07:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
that we basically close at appomattox in
1865

07:02:05.190 --> 07:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
1865
 
07:02:05.200 --> 07:02:07.350 align:start position:0%
1865
right

07:02:07.350 --> 07:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:02:09.270 --> 07:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh any other questions
 
07:02:11.750 --> 07:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
representing the branch
 
07:02:15.270 --> 07:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question uh
 
07:02:17.670 --> 07:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding and you know we've
 
07:02:19.910 --> 07:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
seen history in the civil war that if a
 
07:02:21.750 --> 07:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
state does secede
 
07:02:24.070 --> 07:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
my question is do you think that if we
 
07:02:26.150 --> 07:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
did get to that point where we did
 
07:02:28.230 --> 07:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
declare independence
 
07:02:30.468 --> 07:02:30.478 align:start position:0%
could the united states invade and
 
07:02:31.750 --> 07:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
occupy us
 
07:02:33.510 --> 07:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
as a territory and it would all be for
 
07:02:36.070 --> 07:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
nothing um you know i'm gonna i'm gonna
 
07:02:38.548 --> 07:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
deny the premise of your question
 
07:02:40.868 --> 07:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
because the way that we interpret
 
07:02:42.070 --> 07:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
the civil war and the way that the
 
07:02:44.708 --> 07:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
supreme court has is that states never
 
07:02:46.788 --> 07:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
seceded right there were active
 
07:02:48.468 --> 07:02:48.478 align:start position:0%
rebellions in those states but they
 
07:02:50.390 --> 07:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
never seceded actually
 
07:02:52.788 --> 07:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
every southern state had a legitimately
 
07:02:54.310 --> 07:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
recognized government that was in
 
07:02:55.750 --> 07:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
association with the union throughout
 
07:02:57.430 --> 07:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
the civil war and many of those
 
07:03:00.230 --> 07:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
lawmakers that ran those governments
 
07:03:01.510 --> 07:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
that were still in association with the
 
07:03:04.230 --> 07:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
union and some of them secretly still
 
07:03:05.350 --> 07:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
had open
 
07:03:07.750 --> 07:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
open um open conversations with the
 
07:03:09.750 --> 07:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
union army and with the federal
 
07:03:09.760 --> 07:03:10.708 align:start position:0%
union army and with the federal
government

07:03:10.708 --> 07:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
government
 
07:03:12.948 --> 07:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
right so
 
07:03:14.868 --> 07:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative branch would there be
 
07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
people who are formerly state lawmakers
 
07:03:17.760 --> 07:03:18.708 align:start position:0%
people who are formerly state lawmakers
that

07:03:18.708 --> 07:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
would secede and try to establish their
 
07:03:23.430 --> 07:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
own government in rebellion yes would
 
07:03:25.430 --> 07:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government probably end that
 
07:03:27.590 --> 07:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
rebellion yes but would our state
 
07:03:29.350 --> 07:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
government stop existing
 
07:03:30.868 --> 07:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
no there would still be a legitimate
 
07:03:32.150 --> 07:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
state government because there would
 
07:03:35.030 --> 07:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
still be pro-unionist legislators
 
07:03:37.270 --> 07:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
that would that would stay in that
 
07:03:38.948 --> 07:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
government that would still conduct
 
07:03:40.708 --> 07:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
their own elections and that would be
 
07:03:42.150 --> 07:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
the legitimate government until the
 
07:03:43.350 --> 07:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
federal government was able to
 
07:03:45.350 --> 07:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
re-establish order in conjunction with
 
07:03:46.708 --> 07:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
the state with the pro-unionist
 
07:03:49.910 --> 07:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
government and with our state militia
 
07:03:51.510 --> 07:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
07:03:53.350 --> 07:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up did you have follow-up one
 
07:03:53.360 --> 07:03:54.948 align:start position:0%
follow-up did you have follow-up one
follow-up

07:03:54.948 --> 07:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:03:57.830 --> 07:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is more another constitutional
 
07:03:57.840 --> 07:03:59.430 align:start position:0%
this is more another constitutional
question

07:03:59.430 --> 07:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:04:01.750 --> 07:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
if we passed the cacr and it did get
 
07:04:01.760 --> 07:04:03.270 align:start position:0%
if we passed the cacr and it did get
approved

07:04:03.270 --> 07:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
approved
 
07:04:05.030 --> 07:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
is it correct that it would also be in
 
07:04:06.788 --> 07:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
direct violation of other sections of
 
07:04:08.310 --> 07:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution such as
 
07:04:11.270 --> 07:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
article 7 which specifically states that
 
07:04:12.868 --> 07:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
we do delegate some powers to the
 
07:04:14.708 --> 07:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
american congress because we would have
 
07:04:16.310 --> 07:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
one that says we're independent from the
 
07:04:17.750 --> 07:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
united states and a different section of
 
07:04:19.670 --> 07:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
the same constitution would say
 
07:04:21.910 --> 07:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
we delegate powers yeah the subsection
 
07:04:24.708 --> 07:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
of the same article of you know
 
07:04:27.270 --> 07:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
part one yeah that that's 100 correct we
 
07:04:29.590 --> 07:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
would have we would have the same
 
07:04:29.600 --> 07:04:30.868 align:start position:0%
would have we would have the same
article

07:04:30.868 --> 07:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
article
 
07:04:32.230 --> 07:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
would contradict itself with the
 
07:04:34.230 --> 07:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
subsection right
 
07:04:34.240 --> 07:04:34.948 align:start position:0%
subsection right
so

07:04:34.948 --> 07:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:04:36.390 --> 07:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
then that's the other thing too so now
 
07:04:37.670 --> 07:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
we're all of a sudden
 
07:04:40.230 --> 07:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're not only establishing a um
 
07:04:43.430 --> 07:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
an extremely difficult situation with
 
07:04:44.548 --> 07:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:04:46.468 --> 07:04:46.478 align:start position:0%
the us constitution right and how we
 
07:04:48.150 --> 07:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
would be blatantly violating that we'd
 
07:04:49.590 --> 07:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
also have a
 
07:04:51.030 --> 07:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
a uh you know
 
07:04:53.350 --> 07:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
two two articles in the same you know
 
07:04:55.270 --> 07:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
sorry the same article two parts of it
 
07:04:57.750 --> 07:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
and direct juxtaposition to each other
 
07:04:59.430 --> 07:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
right where we're saying in one we're
 
07:05:00.788 --> 07:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
sovereign over some issues the federal
 
07:05:02.230 --> 07:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
government suffer over other issues
 
07:05:04.310 --> 07:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
essentially just recognizing what the
 
07:05:06.070 --> 07:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
current what the current you know
 
07:05:07.350 --> 07:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional agreement is between
 
07:05:08.468 --> 07:05:08.478 align:start position:0%
these governments and its people and
 
07:05:09.670 --> 07:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
between these two governments in the
 
07:05:09.680 --> 07:05:10.390 align:start position:0%
between these two governments in the
federal

07:05:10.390 --> 07:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
federal
 
07:05:12.150 --> 07:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
system we'd be adopting another
 
07:05:12.160 --> 07:05:13.190 align:start position:0%
system we'd be adopting another
amendment

07:05:13.190 --> 07:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:05:15.110 --> 07:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
against the us constitution that would
 
07:05:16.070 --> 07:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
then say
 
07:05:18.150 --> 07:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
that beginning part of you know
 
07:05:20.310 --> 07:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
recognizing sovereignty uh you know
 
07:05:20.320 --> 07:05:21.110 align:start position:0%
recognizing sovereignty uh you know
that's

07:05:21.110 --> 07:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
07:05:22.708 --> 07:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
you know it would it would be very
 
07:05:24.628 --> 07:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
complex and i think it would be a huge
 
07:05:26.070 --> 07:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
issue and we'd have to address we'd have
 
07:05:28.070 --> 07:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
to further amend our constitution and i
 
07:05:30.150 --> 07:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
would say again unconstitutionally we'd
 
07:05:31.590 --> 07:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
be putting forward amendments that would
 
07:05:33.670 --> 07:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
be going against um
 
07:05:36.070 --> 07:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
against the federal constitution well i
 
07:05:38.230 --> 07:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
would have to repeal the article 7 for
 
07:05:41.190 --> 07:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
sure because i agree with you on that i
 
07:05:42.948 --> 07:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
represent massimilia
 
07:05:44.708 --> 07:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
07:05:47.910 --> 07:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
07:05:50.468 --> 07:05:50.478 align:start position:0%
some of my constituents are concerned
 
07:05:50.478 --> 07:05:51.430 align:start position:0%
some of my constituents are concerned
about

07:05:51.430 --> 07:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:05:53.910 --> 07:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
what happens if this passes and new
 
07:05:56.628 --> 07:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire does become a sovereign nation
 
07:05:58.708 --> 07:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
what will happen to their medicare and
 
07:06:01.190 --> 07:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
their social security
 
07:06:02.868 --> 07:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
well that's a that's a good question and
 
07:06:05.190 --> 07:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
those programs would um
 
07:06:07.030 --> 07:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
they would they would cease to exist now
 
07:06:09.830 --> 07:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
again though um i'm not entirely sure
 
07:06:12.230 --> 07:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely sure well they would i
 
07:06:13.350 --> 07:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
know some of the people they would cease
 
07:06:15.350 --> 07:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
to exist being given by the federal
 
07:06:16.548 --> 07:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
government the state government could
 
07:06:18.708 --> 07:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
try to adopt it but new hampshire
 
07:06:21.430 --> 07:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
typically you know we get a lot more in
 
07:06:22.948 --> 07:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
resources from the federal government
 
07:06:24.628 --> 07:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
than you know
 
07:06:27.190 --> 07:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
than we get from it sorry then we take
 
07:06:30.468 --> 07:06:30.478 align:start position:0%
then we give to it um
 
07:06:32.948 --> 07:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
i think i think representative this is a
 
07:06:34.788 --> 07:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the logistical issue
 
07:06:36.628 --> 07:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
right but the logistical issue that's
 
07:06:38.468 --> 07:06:38.478 align:start position:0%
more that's a matter of preference of
 
07:06:40.390 --> 07:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
how we govern right and so while it's a
 
07:06:41.430 --> 07:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
legitimate question while it's a
 
07:06:43.190 --> 07:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern i'm more worried
 
07:06:45.110 --> 07:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
about the constitutional ramifications
 
07:06:47.110 --> 07:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
right because theoretically we could end
 
07:06:48.468 --> 07:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
our granite advantage program the state
 
07:06:49.670 --> 07:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and the expanded
 
07:06:52.548 --> 07:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid we could stop you know
 
07:06:54.230 --> 07:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
a number we could stop giving you know a
 
07:06:56.390 --> 07:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
certain portion of our state funds to
 
07:06:58.070 --> 07:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
unlock these federal funds and end these
 
07:06:59.430 --> 07:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
programs or we could end a lot of these
 
07:07:01.030 --> 07:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
programs and and a lot of concerns that
 
07:07:02.468 --> 07:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
people have you know whether they're
 
07:07:04.310 --> 07:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate or illegitimate about maybe
 
07:07:06.230 --> 07:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
possible federal overreach in some cases
 
07:07:07.750 --> 07:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think they're very legitimate concerns
 
07:07:10.150 --> 07:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
and others i'm not too sure but i think
 
07:07:11.270 --> 07:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we should really
 
07:07:12.868 --> 07:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
concentrate on the constitutional
 
07:07:14.230 --> 07:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not legislators
 
07:07:16.310 --> 07:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
can actually push this forward and
 
07:07:18.468 --> 07:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
support this and whether or not it's
 
07:07:20.230 --> 07:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
actually going to work within our state
 
07:07:22.548 --> 07:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
constitution be constitutional or
 
07:07:23.670 --> 07:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional with the federal
 
07:07:25.830 --> 07:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
government right and i think so far in
 
07:07:28.310 --> 07:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
my research talking to reading i mean
 
07:07:29.910 --> 07:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not even kidding like 200 pages
 
07:07:32.310 --> 07:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
worth of scholarly documents speaking
 
07:07:33.830 --> 07:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
with the writers of those documents and
 
07:07:35.910 --> 07:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
stuff doing research for you know
 
07:07:37.670 --> 07:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
multiple weeks and sitting down even for
 
07:07:39.190 --> 07:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
an hour this week just to prep with a
 
07:07:40.708 --> 07:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional scholar works
 
07:07:42.948 --> 07:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
internationally on this issue i couldn't
 
07:07:45.350 --> 07:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
find any conceivable universe where we
 
07:07:47.830 --> 07:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
could legitimately do this
 
07:07:49.830 --> 07:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you know uh
 
07:07:51.430 --> 07:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative and it's not a question
 
07:07:53.110 --> 07:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
but for the last 15 years the fourth
 
07:07:54.948 --> 07:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
graders have been coming up here i've
 
07:07:56.310 --> 07:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
been asking every one of them if they
 
07:07:58.628 --> 07:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
ever read the new hampshire constitution
 
07:08:00.788 --> 07:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
i haven't come across too many kids that
 
07:08:01.910 --> 07:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
even know we have a new hampshire
 
07:08:04.150 --> 07:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
constitution so you'd be surprised how
 
07:08:06.230 --> 07:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of new hampshire is they're all
 
07:08:08.788 --> 07:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
many go on the u.s constitution and have
 
07:08:09.990 --> 07:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
no clue
 
07:08:11.590 --> 07:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
about what's in the new hampshire one
 
07:08:13.750 --> 07:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
even some of our reps here
 
07:08:15.670 --> 07:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the building uh representative branch
 
07:08:17.190 --> 07:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
you have another question
 
07:08:19.270 --> 07:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes a question came to me while we
 
07:08:21.350 --> 07:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
were listening to that response uh i
 
07:08:22.788 --> 07:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
hate to ask this type of question but
 
07:08:23.830 --> 07:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
07:08:26.788 --> 07:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
a legal question uh
 
07:08:29.110 --> 07:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
you said that if we did become
 
07:08:30.468 --> 07:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
independent and
 
07:08:31.590 --> 07:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
representatives were part of the
 
07:08:33.190 --> 07:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
traitorous government that they would be
 
07:08:35.750 --> 07:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
treasonous uh would you believe that the
 
07:08:37.350 --> 07:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
the people sponsoring this current
 
07:08:39.030 --> 07:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
legislation would be considered uh
 
07:08:41.510 --> 07:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
treasonous i'm i'm not qualified to
 
07:08:43.030 --> 07:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
answer that question i don't think and
 
07:08:44.788 --> 07:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you why though i'll tell you
 
07:08:45.830 --> 07:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
why though
 
07:08:48.868 --> 07:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
because it's still an open question
 
07:08:50.788 --> 07:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
right we haven't seen this in the modern
 
07:08:53.350 --> 07:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
context in the modern sense it's an open
 
07:08:56.150 --> 07:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
question it's something that the
 
07:08:57.670 --> 07:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
who would decide the answer to this
 
07:08:59.990 --> 07:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
question quite frankly would be the
 
07:09:02.390 --> 07:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
state legislative body right
 
07:09:04.390 --> 07:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
if if another member of the house
 
07:09:07.350 --> 07:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
brought forward you know to to expel
 
07:09:08.788 --> 07:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
another member because of something that
 
07:09:11.830 --> 07:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
they felt violated amendment 14 section
 
07:09:14.628 --> 07:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
3 of the us constitution right and
 
07:09:16.628 --> 07:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
there's that that current proposal right
 
07:09:18.070 --> 07:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
now that would allow us to fill the
 
07:09:20.230 --> 07:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
vacancy if that seat became vacant then
 
07:09:21.910 --> 07:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
that would be when we have to have that
 
07:09:24.070 --> 07:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
debate i hope we don't have that debate
 
07:09:26.070 --> 07:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
i hope that the debate that we have is
 
07:09:27.430 --> 07:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
just about the feasibility of this and
 
07:09:29.510 --> 07:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we let these lawmakers you know
 
07:09:31.590 --> 07:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
voice their opinion introduce what they
 
07:09:33.510 --> 07:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
think is the way to go forward for this
 
07:09:35.190 --> 07:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
state but that we recognize that it's
 
07:09:36.468 --> 07:09:36.478 align:start position:0%
just not feasible it's not
 
07:09:38.868 --> 07:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional and you know we have we
 
07:09:40.868 --> 07:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
have a good strong dialogue with a
 
07:09:42.708 --> 07:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
number of you know residents and u.s
 
07:09:45.350 --> 07:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
citizens in the uh in the crowd today
 
07:09:47.350 --> 07:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
and um and that we as legislators ask
 
07:09:48.708 --> 07:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
them good probing questions really
 
07:09:50.708 --> 07:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
understand what their disdain is for the
 
07:09:52.310 --> 07:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
federal government what their disdain is
 
07:09:54.708 --> 07:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
for overall government and why they
 
07:09:56.468 --> 07:09:56.478 align:start position:0%
think this would work and maybe find
 
07:09:58.230 --> 07:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
ways within constitutional government to
 
07:10:00.230 --> 07:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
address those concerns right and
 
07:10:03.750 --> 07:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually you know improve government
 
07:10:03.760 --> 07:10:05.190 align:start position:0%
actually you know improve government

moffitt
 
07:10:07.590 --> 07:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you again representative uh before
 
07:10:08.948 --> 07:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
we lose you uh to follow up on
 
07:10:11.350 --> 07:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative labrance's question um
 
07:10:13.190 --> 07:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
are you aware that there is a measure in
 
07:10:15.110 --> 07:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
a different committee that's uh being
 
07:10:17.270 --> 07:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
heard with regard to sanctioning people
 
07:10:19.990 --> 07:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
who who uh propose
 
07:10:22.390 --> 07:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
this type of separation have you heard
 
07:10:23.830 --> 07:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
anything about that are you aware of
 
07:10:25.590 --> 07:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
that are you talking about house bill
 
07:10:25.600 --> 07:10:26.948 align:start position:0%
that are you talking about house bill
1007

07:10:26.948 --> 07:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
1007
 
07:10:28.230 --> 07:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
i don't have the number of stuff is it
 
07:10:29.750 --> 07:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
the one that representative bill marsh
 
07:10:31.270 --> 07:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsored is that the one you're
 
07:10:32.948 --> 07:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
talking about that's the one i believe
 
07:10:35.510 --> 07:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes so what that bill does is it doesn't
 
07:10:37.190 --> 07:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
sanction people right the legislature
 
07:10:39.030 --> 07:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
already has this power to say someone's
 
07:10:40.390 --> 07:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
violated the constitution or their oath
 
07:10:42.468 --> 07:10:42.478 align:start position:0%
of office or done something else what
 
07:10:44.628 --> 07:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
the measure does is it allows that if
 
07:10:46.548 --> 07:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
the state legislature right if i can't
 
07:10:48.310 --> 07:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
remember what the exact process is again
 
07:10:49.510 --> 07:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
because i've been so caught up with this
 
07:10:50.868 --> 07:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
i didn't even i didn't want to get into
 
07:10:51.910 --> 07:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
that right and i didn't even want to
 
07:10:53.830 --> 07:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
kind of enter into this discussion but i
 
07:10:53.840 --> 07:10:54.548 align:start position:0%
kind of enter into this discussion but i
think

07:10:54.548 --> 07:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:10:55.830 --> 07:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
the committee if the committee views it
 
07:10:57.990 --> 07:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
as an important aspect then we can talk
 
07:11:01.270 --> 07:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
about it but um it just allows us to
 
07:11:02.868 --> 07:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
fill the seat if someone is expelled
 
07:11:04.708 --> 07:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
from the house that's all that measure
 
07:11:07.670 --> 07:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
does right because the prime sponsor of
 
07:11:08.868 --> 07:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
that and i spoke to him about it to
 
07:11:10.708 --> 07:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
better understand it before this because
 
07:11:13.190 --> 07:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
i said it could come up right and um he
 
07:11:14.708 --> 07:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
said all it does is if someone was
 
07:11:16.468 --> 07:11:16.478 align:start position:0%
expelled from the house for any reason
 
07:11:19.110 --> 07:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
at all right that currently in statutory
 
07:11:19.120 --> 07:11:20.948 align:start position:0%
at all right that currently in statutory
law

07:11:20.948 --> 07:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
law
 
07:11:23.430 --> 07:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
the expelling someone for treason or
 
07:11:25.190 --> 07:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
secessionist acts currently isn't
 
07:11:26.708 --> 07:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
allowed you can't you can't have a
 
07:11:29.110 --> 07:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
special election for that reason
 
07:11:30.948 --> 07:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
right so what it does is it allows the
 
07:11:32.628 --> 07:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
seat to be filled it allows the state
 
07:11:34.628 --> 07:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
government to declare a vacancy and for
 
07:11:35.830 --> 07:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
a special election to happen we can't
 
07:11:37.830 --> 07:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
declare vacancy right now for someone
 
07:11:39.990 --> 07:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
leaving the legislature for that reason
 
07:11:41.910 --> 07:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think we should ever get to
 
07:11:43.590 --> 07:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
that though right because i i don't
 
07:11:43.600 --> 07:11:44.390 align:start position:0%
that though right because i i don't
think

07:11:44.390 --> 07:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:11:46.070 --> 07:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think that there's
 
07:11:48.868 --> 07:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
entirely malice in this right i don't
 
07:11:49.910 --> 07:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
agree with it i don't think it's
 
07:11:52.230 --> 07:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional but i don't think there's
 
07:11:53.510 --> 07:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
malice and i think it's starting an
 
07:11:55.270 --> 07:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
important conversation
 
07:11:57.670 --> 07:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
right for us to have regarding you know
 
07:11:59.670 --> 07:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
the constitution so then residents of
 
07:12:01.990 --> 07:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and members of this body
 
07:12:03.510 --> 07:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
of this legislative body and of the
 
07:12:05.190 --> 07:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
state government can better understand
 
07:12:06.868 --> 07:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
our state and federal constitution
 
07:12:08.468 --> 07:12:08.478 align:start position:0%
better understand our federalist system
 
07:12:10.310 --> 07:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
and better understand sovereignty in
 
07:12:11.670 --> 07:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
general and how that works in a
 
07:12:13.350 --> 07:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
federalist system
 
07:12:15.830 --> 07:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you i'm seeing
 
07:12:17.510 --> 07:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
no other questions
 
07:12:19.430 --> 07:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony you
 
07:12:20.708 --> 07:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
definitely did a great job in
 
07:12:24.070 --> 07:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
researching on stuff that i've already
 
07:12:25.590 --> 07:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
was aware of being on this committee for
 
07:12:28.070 --> 07:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
15 years but constitutional issues so
 
07:12:29.030 --> 07:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:12:30.628 --> 07:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
the chair gonna recognize uh
 
07:12:32.628 --> 07:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative tim horrigan
 
07:12:35.830 --> 07:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:40.788 --> 07:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:42.548 --> 07:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
welcome good to be back i'm represent
 
07:12:43.990 --> 07:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
tim horrigan from stratfor county
 
07:12:45.750 --> 07:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
district six the towns of durham and
 
07:12:48.150 --> 07:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
madbury and
 
07:12:50.628 --> 07:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
even though i'm a state rep from two
 
07:12:52.150 --> 07:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
small towns in new hampshire i consider
 
07:12:54.628 --> 07:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
myself an american first you know i'm
 
07:12:56.948 --> 07:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
proud to be a granite stater but my
 
07:12:58.628 --> 07:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
identity as american
 
07:13:01.350 --> 07:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
comes first and this uh
 
07:13:03.430 --> 07:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
proposal aside from the
 
07:13:04.948 --> 07:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
practical difficulty it does seem kind
 
07:13:06.948 --> 07:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
of un-american
 
07:13:08.628 --> 07:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
there is a constitutional conundrum i
 
07:13:11.190 --> 07:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
think the members who sponsored it
 
07:13:14.070 --> 07:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
were protected from punishment for
 
07:13:16.548 --> 07:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
saying unpopular things um and
 
07:13:18.070 --> 07:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know saying you're doing unpopular
 
07:13:19.430 --> 07:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
things in the scope of our duties the
 
07:13:21.670 --> 07:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislature on the other hand it does
 
07:13:23.030 --> 07:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
kind of conflict with the oath we took
 
07:13:26.150 --> 07:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
to defend the us constitution but
 
07:13:27.910 --> 07:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure at least this time around
 
07:13:29.830 --> 07:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's not much chance of it uh
 
07:13:31.990 --> 07:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
passing i don't see how the sponsors are
 
07:13:34.390 --> 07:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
going to get to 240 votes and let alone
 
07:13:36.628 --> 07:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the people approving it
 
07:13:36.638 --> 07:13:38.230 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the people approving it
um

07:13:38.230 --> 07:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:39.910 --> 07:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
mr representatives made a lot of
 
07:13:41.750 --> 07:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
interesting points some he did a lot of
 
07:13:44.310 --> 07:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
research i um i've sometimes researched
 
07:13:45.830 --> 07:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
issues like that in that much detail i
 
07:13:47.190 --> 07:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to do it this time but
 
07:13:48.548 --> 07:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
i've been thinking about for a long time
 
07:13:50.868 --> 07:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
but ivy
 
07:13:52.390 --> 07:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
just on a person note i have a great
 
07:13:54.390 --> 07:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
great great uncle who is a senator from
 
07:13:56.548 --> 07:13:56.558 align:start position:0%
virginia not west virginia but virginia
 
07:13:59.110 --> 07:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
during world war ii because he
 
07:14:01.110 --> 07:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
he was basically well that was back when
 
07:14:03.590 --> 07:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
um senators were appointed so he was
 
07:14:05.590 --> 07:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
appointed by you know a
 
07:14:07.270 --> 07:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
provisional legislature for the small
 
07:14:08.468 --> 07:14:08.478 align:start position:0%
parts of
 
07:14:09.910 --> 07:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
virginia that
 
07:14:11.030 --> 07:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
weren't either
 
07:14:12.628 --> 07:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
controlled by the confederacy or hadn't
 
07:14:14.310 --> 07:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
become part of west virginia his name
 
07:14:14.320 --> 07:14:15.270 align:start position:0%
become part of west virginia his name
was

07:14:15.270 --> 07:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
07:14:18.390 --> 07:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
senator lemuel jackson bowden so i'm
 
07:14:20.390 --> 07:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
proud to be at least related only by
 
07:14:23.430 --> 07:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
marriage to him um
 
07:14:25.590 --> 07:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:14:27.910 --> 07:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
and said the residents of shays explain
 
07:14:29.990 --> 07:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
the practical implications this is just
 
07:14:32.230 --> 07:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
about impossible there are some nations
 
07:14:33.990 --> 07:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
that are smaller than us that are doing
 
07:14:36.628 --> 07:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
okay but i don't really think
 
07:14:37.990 --> 07:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
really don't think we could we don't
 
07:14:39.830 --> 07:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
really have anything
 
07:14:42.070 --> 07:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
aside from the borders that and certain
 
07:14:44.150 --> 07:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know little cultural quirky things
 
07:14:46.070 --> 07:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
like liquor stores the interstate and no
 
07:14:47.670 --> 07:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
income or sales tax i think we're not
 
07:14:49.190 --> 07:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
really uh
 
07:14:50.708 --> 07:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
we're not really equipped to be an
 
07:14:52.390 --> 07:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
independent entity apart from the other
 
07:14:54.708 --> 07:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
49 united states that's just part of it
 
07:14:56.468 --> 07:14:56.478 align:start position:0%
is not going to work although we do have
 
07:14:58.070 --> 07:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
two international airports one of which
 
07:14:59.830 --> 07:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
is right near right in my part of the
 
07:15:01.990 --> 07:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
state the portsmouth uh
 
07:15:03.510 --> 07:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth airport formerly peace
 
07:15:05.510 --> 07:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
air force base uh could easily be
 
07:15:07.270 --> 07:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
converted international airport we also
 
07:15:08.708 --> 07:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
have manchester
 
07:15:10.150 --> 07:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
we probably have to take the boston off
 
07:15:12.230 --> 07:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
of manchester boston regional airport so
 
07:15:14.390 --> 07:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
07:15:16.708 --> 07:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
and as for the federal government um it
 
07:15:18.708 --> 07:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
is pretty big i'm not sure if it's
 
07:15:18.718 --> 07:15:20.468 align:start position:0%
is pretty big i'm not sure if it's
necessarily

07:15:20.468 --> 07:15:20.478 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
07:15:21.750 --> 07:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
more regressive than the state
 
07:15:23.750 --> 07:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
governments a lot of the
 
07:15:25.590 --> 07:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
progress we've made
 
07:15:27.270 --> 07:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
over the last decades and centuries has
 
07:15:29.030 --> 07:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually been more driven by the federal
 
07:15:30.948 --> 07:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
government which tends to be more i
 
07:15:33.350 --> 07:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
think more respectful of
 
07:15:34.948 --> 07:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
people's rights than the individual
 
07:15:38.548 --> 07:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
state government so it certainly
 
07:15:40.628 --> 07:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
has very weak leadership at the moment
 
07:15:42.548 --> 07:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
um especially the senate i was watching
 
07:15:44.948 --> 07:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
the senate on c-span even though our
 
07:15:46.948 --> 07:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
most individuals and senators are great
 
07:15:49.110 --> 07:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
and our especially i
 
07:15:51.590 --> 07:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
respect our two senators deeply and one
 
07:15:52.868 --> 07:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
of whom senator shaheen is my
 
07:15:54.468 --> 07:15:54.478 align:start position:0%
constituent but
 
07:15:56.070 --> 07:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
certainly the senate is a bad joke
 
07:15:57.830 --> 07:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening there is totally
 
07:16:00.788 --> 07:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
not right um we've had uh
 
07:16:02.788 --> 07:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
i don't i'm not totally satisfied even
 
07:16:03.990 --> 07:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
with the current president even though i
 
07:16:05.510 --> 07:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
voted for him and i have my syllabus
 
07:16:07.030 --> 07:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
bumper stick in my car and as for the
 
07:16:09.030 --> 07:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
last one i know there's some friends of
 
07:16:12.230 --> 07:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
his here supporters but he certainly
 
07:16:13.590 --> 07:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think at least have denied that was
 
07:16:14.788 --> 07:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason that was a very
 
07:16:18.468 --> 07:16:18.478 align:start position:0%
chaotic four years and that was uh
 
07:16:19.590 --> 07:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of strange things
 
07:16:20.548 --> 07:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
happened and he didn't really have
 
07:16:22.310 --> 07:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
control over it so that's i don't know
 
07:16:23.750 --> 07:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
if the federal government necessarily
 
07:16:25.590 --> 07:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
works i certainly
 
07:16:25.600 --> 07:16:26.468 align:start position:0%
works i certainly
um

07:16:26.468 --> 07:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:27.750 --> 07:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know we're sitting in committee
 
07:16:29.190 --> 07:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're bipartisan so this is not a
 
07:16:30.548 --> 07:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
partisan thing but we'll just
 
07:16:32.390 --> 07:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledge i'm a democrat and i don't
 
07:16:34.390 --> 07:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
even trust my fellow democrats to run a
 
07:16:37.030 --> 07:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
small independent country 1.38 million
 
07:16:39.350 --> 07:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
people let alone
 
07:16:40.948 --> 07:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
let alone the proponents of this they're
 
07:16:42.468 --> 07:16:42.478 align:start position:0%
even less qualified than my federal
 
07:16:44.868 --> 07:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
democrats i just uh
 
07:16:46.788 --> 07:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
it'd be very steep learning curve to us
 
07:16:49.670 --> 07:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
actually being independent countries
 
07:16:51.190 --> 07:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
so i say we should
 
07:16:52.468 --> 07:16:52.478 align:start position:0%
we're part of the united states there's
 
07:16:54.948 --> 07:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
no way we can get out um unless
 
07:16:56.388 --> 07:16:56.398 align:start position:0%
something really dr things really
 
07:16:59.830 --> 07:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
drastic change and so i would say uh
 
07:17:02.388 --> 07:17:02.398 align:start position:0%
this casa is a waste of time and i will
 
07:17:03.830 --> 07:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
certainly be voting against it when it
 
07:17:05.830 --> 07:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
comes to the floor or whatever else so
 
07:17:07.350 --> 07:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you representative will you
 
07:17:09.510 --> 07:17:09.520 align:start position:0%

07:17:39.590 --> 07:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative from this biennium 2020
 
07:17:41.670 --> 07:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
2022 for a reason
 
07:17:43.990 --> 07:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
in our state government we have had our
 
07:17:46.150 --> 07:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
rights as citizens usurped by the
 
07:17:49.270 --> 07:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
highest office here the governor had me
 
07:17:51.190 --> 07:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
removed from the state house on january
 
07:17:53.110 --> 07:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
7th inauguration day because he called
 
07:17:53.120 --> 07:17:54.150 align:start position:0%
7th inauguration day because he called
it

07:17:54.150 --> 07:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:17:56.468 --> 07:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
armed protesters were at his house
 
07:17:58.310 --> 07:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
so he made his inauguration private and
 
07:17:59.590 --> 07:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow me to be sworn into
 
07:18:01.590 --> 07:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
office a duly elected representative of
 
07:18:03.910 --> 07:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
the people there's my constituency right
 
07:18:05.990 --> 07:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
there liberty patriots in this state
 
07:18:08.548 --> 07:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
have been usurped of their rights
 
07:18:11.110 --> 07:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
redress of grievance has been denied
 
07:18:12.628 --> 07:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
dan richard has had a redress of
 
07:18:14.230 --> 07:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
grievance before the private the
 
07:18:16.310 --> 07:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
previous biennium in 2018 under
 
07:18:18.310 --> 07:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
democratic leadership to my utter
 
07:18:20.708 --> 07:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
surprise and dismay under a republican
 
07:18:23.030 --> 07:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
leadership in 2020 22
 
07:18:24.468 --> 07:18:24.478 align:start position:0%
they did not hear the redress of
 
07:18:26.150 --> 07:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
grievance from the people so if you
 
07:18:27.590 --> 07:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
remove redress or grievance from the
 
07:18:29.670 --> 07:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
people what cause do the people have to
 
07:18:31.030 --> 07:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
let their government know they're very
 
07:18:32.788 --> 07:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
unhappy with what's happened
 
07:18:35.190 --> 07:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
since january 7th on april 9th our state
 
07:18:37.990 --> 07:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
speaker speaker packard called me a
 
07:18:40.070 --> 07:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
female representative a female slur and
 
07:18:42.708 --> 07:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
never apologized for it i took my shots
 
07:18:44.310 --> 07:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
and slings and arrows and stayed as a
 
07:18:45.590 --> 07:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
state rep
 
07:18:47.910 --> 07:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
june 24th we had a budget bill where the
 
07:18:50.548 --> 07:18:50.558 align:start position:0%
governor took all of our activist groups
 
07:18:52.070 --> 07:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
and put them and paraded them in front
 
07:18:54.548 --> 07:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
of us okay if i may hit the side what
 
07:18:55.670 --> 07:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
does this have to do with the
 
07:18:58.310 --> 07:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
07:18:59.750 --> 07:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
this is new hampshire what you're
 
07:19:01.910 --> 07:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
talking about we're talking about state
 
07:19:03.590 --> 07:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
sovereignty and our people but we're
 
07:19:05.350 --> 07:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
talking about succeeding from the united
 
07:19:06.628 --> 07:19:06.638 align:start position:0%
states talking about putting it on the
 
07:19:08.070 --> 07:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
ballot so the people of new hampshire
 
07:19:09.430 --> 07:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
can vote for it
 
07:19:10.868 --> 07:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
okay but what i'm trying to say is if
 
07:19:12.868 --> 07:19:12.878 align:start position:0%

07:19:15.270 --> 07:19:15.280 align:start position:0%

07:19:19.030 --> 07:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
succeeding from the united standing to
 
07:19:21.270 --> 07:19:21.280 align:start position:0%

07:19:23.190 --> 07:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
elected by the people in her town
 
07:19:26.070 --> 07:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
representing my constituents cannot be
 
07:19:27.830 --> 07:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
effective in government has had the
 
07:19:29.670 --> 07:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
governor remove me by state police from
 
07:19:31.910 --> 07:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
the state house has had our honorable
 
07:19:33.830 --> 07:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
state speaker who's a republican i
 
07:19:36.230 --> 07:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
happen to be republican allowed a race a
 
07:19:38.628 --> 07:19:38.638 align:start position:0%

07:19:43.110 --> 07:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
my party told me don't do that we might
 
07:19:44.948 --> 07:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
wind up with the other party speaker
 
07:19:46.628 --> 07:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
well excuse me there's a certain level
 
07:19:48.628 --> 07:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
of integrity and decorum that that
 
07:19:49.990 --> 07:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
office holds and he should have been
 
07:19:51.510 --> 07:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
held to account he should have been
 
07:19:53.190 --> 07:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
brought up on charges for the ethics
 
07:19:55.350 --> 07:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
commission and nobody wanted to do it my
 
07:19:57.510 --> 07:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
fellow women in the republican house
 
07:19:59.830 --> 07:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
said oh don't do that
 
07:20:01.270 --> 07:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
where's the support from the women for
 
07:20:03.830 --> 07:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
me as a representative and a female zero
 
07:20:06.468 --> 07:20:06.478 align:start position:0%
so i move forward to june i understand
 
07:20:08.548 --> 07:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
but are we looking to get rid of that to
 
07:20:09.430 --> 07:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
the end
 
07:20:10.868 --> 07:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
but i'm saying this are we looking to
 
07:20:13.590 --> 07:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
get rid of the state reps too along with
 
07:20:15.910 --> 07:20:15.920 align:start position:0%

07:21:06.948 --> 07:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
wrapped poop sandwich to be
 
07:21:09.750 --> 07:21:09.760 align:start position:0%

representatives were usurped their arms
 
07:21:13.990 --> 07:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
were twisted by the governor and his
 
07:21:15.910 --> 07:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
minions in the establishment republican
 
07:21:18.388 --> 07:21:18.398 align:start position:0%
party to vote against their principles
 
07:21:20.788 --> 07:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
the freedom caucus was
 
07:21:22.708 --> 07:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
the knees taken out from under them that
 
07:21:24.788 --> 07:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
was the last bastion these people had of
 
07:21:26.948 --> 07:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
their voice in the house gone
 
07:21:29.110 --> 07:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
so now we're here to speak to you to let
 
07:21:31.590 --> 07:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know we're very unhappy we want your
 
07:21:33.910 --> 07:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
government our government to respect us
 
07:21:36.468 --> 07:21:36.478 align:start position:0%
it's not us versus them we're citizens
 
07:21:38.788 --> 07:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
and our citizenry is being ignored what
 
07:21:40.948 --> 07:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
else are we left to do so i left the
 
07:21:43.350 --> 07:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
state house with dignity
 
07:21:45.350 --> 07:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
she became an activist because i want
 
07:21:48.708 --> 07:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
our liberty and our rights restored
 
07:21:50.948 --> 07:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
so are you asking us then to modify this
 
07:21:52.788 --> 07:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
here and maybe go after go after the
 
07:21:54.150 --> 07:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
governor and the
 
07:21:56.310 --> 07:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
state rep or the speaker
 
07:21:59.350 --> 07:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
versus the u.s i'd love to talk to you
 
07:22:00.708 --> 07:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
about that
 
07:22:02.788 --> 07:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
representative baldusow but
 
07:22:06.230 --> 07:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
to be specific to the cacr32
 
07:22:07.990 --> 07:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
i would like us to pass it and let the
 
07:22:10.830 --> 07:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
people decide at the ballot box november
 
07:22:13.510 --> 07:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
2022 okay
 
07:22:15.750 --> 07:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um is there a question
 
07:22:17.350 --> 07:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative branch
 
07:22:19.110 --> 07:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
you'll take questions uh you know i'll
 
07:22:21.110 --> 07:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
take a few in the in light of people
 
07:22:22.868 --> 07:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
needing to speak
 
07:22:26.468 --> 07:22:26.478 align:start position:0%
uh my first question i have many is
 
07:22:28.788 --> 07:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
how does the cacr change anything about
 
07:22:31.030 --> 07:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
the corruption that you accused redress
 
07:22:32.708 --> 07:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
of grievance
 
07:22:32.718 --> 07:22:34.468 align:start position:0%
of grievance
but

07:22:34.468 --> 07:22:34.478 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:22:35.990 --> 07:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
how does leaving the federal government
 
07:22:37.990 --> 07:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
change state government versus
 
07:22:39.270 --> 07:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
succeeding from the federal government
 
07:22:41.110 --> 07:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
to become a sovereign state once again
 
07:22:42.628 --> 07:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
we're called a sovereign state but we're
 
07:22:44.868 --> 07:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
really not if your government's run away
 
07:22:46.310 --> 07:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and you're not listening our our
 
07:22:48.788 --> 07:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
governor if you are not aware arrested
 
07:22:50.388 --> 07:22:50.398 align:start position:0%
some folks at the executive council
 
07:22:52.708 --> 07:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
meeting on october 13th i believe it was
 
07:22:54.230 --> 07:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong is it the 13th
 
07:22:56.788 --> 07:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
or the 17th the 13th arrested a
 
07:22:59.030 --> 07:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
grandmother dragged her to her knees 72
 
07:23:01.030 --> 07:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
years old do you know who did that at
 
07:23:02.628 --> 07:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
the request of our governor our own
 
07:23:04.868 --> 07:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
state police yes granted they may have
 
07:23:06.948 --> 07:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
been the detail officers for the
 
07:23:08.548 --> 07:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
governor and they may have had a certain
 
07:23:10.548 --> 07:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
affinity for him growing to learn how he
 
07:23:12.788 --> 07:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
has been with them but they violated
 
07:23:14.468 --> 07:23:14.478 align:start position:0%
their oath
 
07:23:15.670 --> 07:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
when i'm trying to get it and i
 
07:23:17.750 --> 07:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but
 
07:23:19.510 --> 07:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
let's say we succeed from the u.s but
 
07:23:20.310 --> 07:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're still
 
07:23:22.150 --> 07:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
horus before the cart but you still got
 
07:23:23.190 --> 07:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
the governor you still got the
 
07:23:25.590 --> 07:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislation aci 32 on the ballot that's
 
07:23:28.150 --> 07:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
it right agreement
 
07:23:30.230 --> 07:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't please don't uh
 
07:23:31.670 --> 07:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
but you still what i'm trying to say is
 
07:23:32.948 --> 07:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
you still have the governor you still
 
07:23:35.350 --> 07:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
like the u.s reps we take baby steps
 
07:23:37.670 --> 07:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
once this passes if the citizenry of our
 
07:23:39.670 --> 07:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
state decide this is what they want then
 
07:23:41.510 --> 07:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
we reconvene and have meetings about how
 
07:23:43.670 --> 07:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
to do the commerce clause the pzfos
 
07:23:45.990 --> 07:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
clause all of those things think of this
 
07:23:47.990 --> 07:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
we talk about social security and money
 
07:23:49.510 --> 07:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
from the government what if we're not
 
07:23:51.350 --> 07:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
sending our money to the government we
 
07:23:53.110 --> 07:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
keep it in new hampshire
 
07:23:54.708 --> 07:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
yeah we're going to have to if there's
 
07:23:56.948 --> 07:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
something like this we moved it forward
 
07:23:59.110 --> 07:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
because everyone's money would be uh i
 
07:24:00.548 --> 07:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
don't know if we could get it back from
 
07:24:02.310 --> 07:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
07:24:04.070 --> 07:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know retirements and everything else
 
07:24:06.388 --> 07:24:06.398 align:start position:0%
uh that are because we would be in like
 
07:24:08.468 --> 07:24:08.478 align:start position:0%
a separate country it's our money don't
 
07:24:10.150 --> 07:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
forget the bunny tree doesn't have a
 
07:24:11.830 --> 07:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
left to the right pocket it's the same
 
07:24:14.070 --> 07:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
citizen you know representative you know
 
07:24:15.590 --> 07:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
i got the utmost respect for you and i'm
 
07:24:16.948 --> 07:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
one of one of
 
07:24:19.830 --> 07:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
the only reps there with paul ingridson
 
07:24:21.830 --> 07:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
dan itsy that started to redress the
 
07:24:24.230 --> 07:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
grieving caucus in this house and we
 
07:24:26.070 --> 07:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
moved forward we got representative bill
 
07:24:28.468 --> 07:24:28.478 align:start position:0%
o'brien to move forward with redress so
 
07:24:30.788 --> 07:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
we have done this here in the house
 
07:24:32.150 --> 07:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
in there and then of course over the
 
07:24:35.510 --> 07:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
years they they stopped it took it away
 
07:24:37.190 --> 07:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
but this bill has nothing to do with
 
07:24:39.590 --> 07:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill has nothing to do
 
07:24:41.510 --> 07:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and i'm hoping when you come
 
07:24:44.468 --> 07:24:44.478 align:start position:0%
up here you talk about the legislation
 
07:24:46.708 --> 07:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
and not what joe schmuckatelli did to
 
07:24:46.718 --> 07:24:47.510 align:start position:0%
and not what joe schmuckatelli did to
you

you
 
07:24:49.270 --> 07:24:49.280 align:start position:0%

because
 
07:25:48.230 --> 07:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
this what you see here
 
07:25:50.788 --> 07:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
is a product of a lot of patients
 
07:25:52.708 --> 07:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of patients
 
07:25:54.468 --> 07:25:54.478 align:start position:0%
and i it might be hard for many to
 
07:25:54.478 --> 07:25:56.230 align:start position:0%
and i it might be hard for many to
understand

07:25:56.230 --> 07:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:25:56.240 --> 07:25:57.750 align:start position:0%
understand
but

07:25:57.750 --> 07:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:26:00.070 --> 07:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
from the entirety of my life
 
07:26:02.150 --> 07:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
i've watched presidents come and go
 
07:26:04.468 --> 07:26:04.478 align:start position:0%
congresses come and go
 
07:26:06.310 --> 07:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
and i have watched
 
07:26:08.070 --> 07:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
the rights and liberties
 
07:26:10.230 --> 07:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
of the people here in new hampshire and
 
07:26:12.948 --> 07:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
the people across this country
 
07:26:15.110 --> 07:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
be severely diminished
 
07:26:17.190 --> 07:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
and in
 
07:26:18.868 --> 07:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
ways that
 
07:26:21.190 --> 07:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
are very much disconnected from us but
 
07:26:23.110 --> 07:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
very much
 
07:26:24.788 --> 07:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
very much important to all of us
 
07:26:27.750 --> 07:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of party
 
07:26:27.760 --> 07:26:30.628 align:start position:0%
regardless of party
um

07:26:30.628 --> 07:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:33.190 --> 07:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
my political engagement
 
07:26:34.948 --> 07:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
the reason why i actually
 
07:26:37.590 --> 07:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
ran for the house of representatives had
 
07:26:39.750 --> 07:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with issues so great as
 
07:26:39.760 --> 07:26:40.708 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with issues so great as
this

07:26:40.708 --> 07:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:26:42.868 --> 07:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
but it had to do with a
 
07:26:42.878 --> 07:26:44.230 align:start position:0%
but it had to do with a
disgust

07:26:44.230 --> 07:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
disgust
 
07:26:44.240 --> 07:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
disgust
of

07:26:45.350 --> 07:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:26:48.070 --> 07:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
what i was seeing going on around me
 
07:26:50.788 --> 07:26:50.798 align:start position:0%

on september 17 1787.
 
07:33:00.070 --> 07:33:00.080 align:start position:0%

07:33:02.788 --> 07:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
constitution was in place before the
 
07:33:06.548 --> 07:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:08.388 --> 07:33:08.398 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
07:33:11.270 --> 07:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
um so what i want to do is i want to
 
07:33:12.708 --> 07:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
take this from a little bit of a
 
07:33:15.590 --> 07:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
different perspective um we've heard a
 
07:33:17.430 --> 07:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
lot today about
 
07:33:20.310 --> 07:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh the people of new hampshire are tired
 
07:33:23.110 --> 07:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're tired of of the tear what we feel
 
07:33:25.430 --> 07:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
is tyranny at the federal level
 
07:33:29.190 --> 07:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
um i want to give you um what the united
 
07:33:32.070 --> 07:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
united nations definition
 
07:33:35.030 --> 07:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
can be defined as a pattern of behavior
 
07:33:38.230 --> 07:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
that is used to gain or maintain power
 
07:33:40.628 --> 07:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
and control
 
07:33:44.230 --> 07:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
it can manifest as emotional economic or
 
07:33:46.310 --> 07:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
psychological actions or threats of
 
07:33:49.750 --> 07:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
actions that influence on another person
 
07:33:51.910 --> 07:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
this includes any behaviors that
 
07:33:55.670 --> 07:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
frighten intimidate terrorize manipulate
 
07:33:58.788 --> 07:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
and hurt it can happen to anyone of any
 
07:34:02.150 --> 07:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
race age sexual orientation religion
 
07:34:04.788 --> 07:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
religious identity or gender it affects
 
07:34:07.350 --> 07:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
people of all socioeconomic backgrounds
 
07:34:09.510 --> 07:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
and education levels incidents are
 
07:34:12.230 --> 07:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
really isolated and usually escalate in
 
07:34:14.708 --> 07:34:14.718 align:start position:0%
a frequency and surveillance
 
07:34:16.310 --> 07:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
you have some of us confused what are
 
07:34:18.070 --> 07:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
you talking about i'm reading the
 
07:34:21.190 --> 07:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
definition from the united nations
 
07:34:23.430 --> 07:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
but this i'm i will be getting to that
 
07:34:25.590 --> 07:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
in just a second it sounds familiar
 
07:34:25.600 --> 07:34:26.708 align:start position:0%
in just a second it sounds familiar
though

07:34:26.708 --> 07:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
though
 
07:34:28.548 --> 07:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
yeah but can you stick with this here
 
07:34:31.190 --> 07:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
because uh this is dealing with the us
 
07:34:33.590 --> 07:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
succeeding so we don't care what the u.n
 
07:34:35.830 --> 07:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
says i used the united states definition
 
07:34:38.868 --> 07:34:38.878 align:start position:0%
because it was very very broad um
 
07:34:40.868 --> 07:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
what this definition is
 
07:34:43.110 --> 07:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
is of um abuse
 
07:34:45.670 --> 07:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
this is the definition of abuse the
 
07:34:47.350 --> 07:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire and the people
 
07:34:49.590 --> 07:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
of all of our states in the union have
 
07:34:51.590 --> 07:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
been abused by the federal government
 
07:34:53.510 --> 07:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's very clear to see if you look
 
07:34:55.990 --> 07:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
around and you look at the statistics of
 
07:35:00.230 --> 07:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
suicide of mental illness all of that is
 
07:35:02.868 --> 07:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
stop treating the disease and stop
 
07:35:04.628 --> 07:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
treating the symptoms and treat the
 
07:35:07.670 --> 07:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
disease the disease is we are being
 
07:35:09.590 --> 07:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
abused as a people
 
07:35:12.310 --> 07:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
we have a tyrannical government and have
 
07:35:14.830 --> 07:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
for quite a while long before this
 
07:35:18.310 --> 07:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
administration um and the bottom line is
 
07:35:21.750 --> 07:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
nobody not one single human in this
 
07:35:24.948 --> 07:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
world deserves to be abused we do not
 
07:35:27.910 --> 07:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
deserve to be intimidated and frightened
 
07:35:30.468 --> 07:35:30.478 align:start position:0%
and terrorized and manipulated
 
07:35:33.270 --> 07:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
are you ready to help that this state
 
07:35:35.030 --> 07:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
are you ready to begin the wave of
 
07:35:36.868 --> 07:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
freedom against this abuse
 
07:35:38.948 --> 07:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
after all isn't that the advice that
 
07:35:40.468 --> 07:35:40.478 align:start position:0%
you'd give your own loving family
 
07:35:40.478 --> 07:35:41.910 align:start position:0%
you'd give your own loving family
members

07:35:41.910 --> 07:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
members
 
07:35:43.430 --> 07:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
walk away
 
07:35:46.788 --> 07:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:50.788 --> 07:35:50.798 align:start position:0%
well thank you are there any questions
 
07:35:55.030 --> 07:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:57.190 --> 07:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
let me see
 
07:35:58.948 --> 07:35:58.958 align:start position:0%

and they'll pass it up to the clerk
 
07:36:07.350 --> 07:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
the chair recognized uh that supports
 
07:36:08.310 --> 07:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:36:10.868 --> 07:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
jason gerhard
 
07:36:12.548 --> 07:36:12.558 align:start position:0%

07:36:23.190 --> 07:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay welcome you three minutes please
 
07:36:24.310 --> 07:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going
 
07:36:26.708 --> 07:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
go get it so i want to so i want to take
 
07:36:28.388 --> 07:36:28.398 align:start position:0%
a little different approach on this
 
07:36:30.468 --> 07:36:30.478 align:start position:0%
and look at the criminal justice
 
07:36:32.150 --> 07:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
ramifications of what's happening with
 
07:36:33.430 --> 07:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
07:36:35.670 --> 07:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
so as someone that spent 12 and a half
 
07:36:37.430 --> 07:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
years in federal prison on some bogus
 
07:36:39.350 --> 07:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
charges related to the federal income
 
07:36:41.750 --> 07:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
tax i can say that the federal courts
 
07:36:44.070 --> 07:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
are completely and utterly corrupt the
 
07:36:45.590 --> 07:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
state courts at least have some
 
07:36:47.350 --> 07:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
semblance of justice because of jury
 
07:36:48.868 --> 07:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
nullification which thankfully new
 
07:36:50.948 --> 07:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire passed in 2012.
 
07:36:53.270 --> 07:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
so for those who aren't aware and just
 
07:36:54.788 --> 07:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
how important this is because you cannot
 
07:36:56.708 --> 07:36:56.718 align:start position:0%
bring up jury nullification in federal
 
07:36:58.708 --> 07:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
court you'll get shut down before you
 
07:37:00.388 --> 07:37:00.398 align:start position:0%
even get the first word out
 
07:37:00.398 --> 07:37:02.948 align:start position:0%
even get the first word out
so

07:37:02.948 --> 07:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:05.590 --> 07:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
juries now okay
 
07:37:08.230 --> 07:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
the judges they can override the rulings
 
07:37:09.510 --> 07:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
of judges they believe the judges are
 
07:37:11.030 --> 07:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting or misapplying the
 
07:37:13.030 --> 07:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
relevant law so even if you are caught
 
07:37:14.628 --> 07:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
with a kilo of crack you can say listen
 
07:37:18.230 --> 07:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
jerry this law is bogus and so be it you
 
07:37:20.628 --> 07:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
can't do that in federal court and
 
07:37:22.070 --> 07:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
in federal court is where the most
 
07:37:23.670 --> 07:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
abuses occur
 
07:37:25.190 --> 07:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
decades and decades and decades are
 
07:37:27.670 --> 07:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
given out for the most mundane things
 
07:37:30.388 --> 07:37:30.398 align:start position:0%
from growing weed to if you file a lien
 
07:37:32.150 --> 07:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
against a federal official that's a
 
07:37:34.788 --> 07:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
felony you lose your rights forever gun
 
07:37:36.628 --> 07:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
rights and other things
 
07:37:38.468 --> 07:37:38.478 align:start position:0%
so if we were to step away from the
 
07:37:39.910 --> 07:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
07:37:41.590 --> 07:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
we could then
 
07:37:44.150 --> 07:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
overhaul the whole corrupt federal court
 
07:37:45.990 --> 07:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
system as it stands which i think is the
 
07:37:47.270 --> 07:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
most important thing you have people
 
07:37:49.110 --> 07:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
riding away in federal prison right now
 
07:37:50.788 --> 07:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
so you wanted well he's not here anymore
 
07:37:52.548 --> 07:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
because he's on to more important things
 
07:37:54.150 --> 07:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
but talking to all these constitutional
 
07:37:54.160 --> 07:37:55.350 align:start position:0%
but talking to all these constitutional
scholars

07:37:55.350 --> 07:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
scholars
 
07:37:56.468 --> 07:37:56.478 align:start position:0%
i mean come on you don't need a
 
07:37:57.750 --> 07:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional scholar to figure out the
 
07:37:59.430 --> 07:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
constitution so supply to everyday
 
07:38:01.590 --> 07:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
normal people if the average american
 
07:38:02.868 --> 07:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
can't understand the constitution we
 
07:38:04.788 --> 07:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
have to rewrite it thomas jefferson said
 
07:38:06.868 --> 07:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
the constitution should be
 
07:38:09.270 --> 07:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
re-hauled every 19 years
 
07:38:10.788 --> 07:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
so he figured it was a generation of men
 
07:38:13.110 --> 07:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
would be about 19 years we had this idea
 
07:38:14.468 --> 07:38:14.478 align:start position:0%
that we have to follow these rules of
 
07:38:16.230 --> 07:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
these guys have been dead so long no one
 
07:38:18.070 --> 07:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
even knows their names we print them on
 
07:38:19.350 --> 07:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
money that's created by the federal
 
07:38:21.510 --> 07:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
reserve which is a complete fraud as it
 
07:38:23.270 --> 07:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
is i mean why do we want to stay part of
 
07:38:25.430 --> 07:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
this system i don't understand it what
 
07:38:27.590 --> 07:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
is so sacred about it we're holding on
 
07:38:29.670 --> 07:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
to old traditions that don't exist
 
07:38:29.680 --> 07:38:30.948 align:start position:0%
to old traditions that don't exist
anymore

07:38:30.948 --> 07:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
07:38:32.628 --> 07:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
these rights don't exist i mean look at
 
07:38:34.070 --> 07:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
the bill of rights you have corporations
 
07:38:36.708 --> 07:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
for pretending to be people
 
07:38:38.150 --> 07:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
they have the rights you know now we
 
07:38:40.150 --> 07:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
have federal corporations and state
 
07:38:41.990 --> 07:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
corporations that
 
07:38:42.000 --> 07:38:42.868 align:start position:0%
corporations that
um

07:38:42.868 --> 07:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:38:45.350 --> 07:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
operate in other states that overall the
 
07:38:47.190 --> 07:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
the will of the people everywhere and
 
07:38:47.200 --> 07:38:48.788 align:start position:0%
the will of the people everywhere and
internationally

07:38:48.788 --> 07:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
internationally
 
07:38:50.708 --> 07:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
so i think we've just created a monster
 
07:38:52.868 --> 07:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
and we can talk about oh we're what's
 
07:38:54.310 --> 07:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen to our social security
 
07:38:55.910 --> 07:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
there is no money in social security we
 
07:38:56.948 --> 07:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
know that
 
07:38:58.310 --> 07:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
come on they're printing the printing
 
07:38:59.750 --> 07:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
presses haven't stopped those things are
 
07:39:01.350 --> 07:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
smoking right now inflation's
 
07:39:03.750 --> 07:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing like we have to stop and
 
07:39:05.510 --> 07:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
focus here
 
07:39:07.990 --> 07:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know we'll find a way to find trade
 
07:39:10.070 --> 07:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
the canadians want our maple syrup you
 
07:39:11.030 --> 07:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
know like
 
07:39:12.948 --> 07:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
just we're focusing on the wrong stuff
 
07:39:14.628 --> 07:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
here there's people riding in federal
 
07:39:16.150 --> 07:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
prison oh and one last thing and i'll
 
07:39:18.310 --> 07:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
just wrap this up the adpa the
 
07:39:19.670 --> 07:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
anti-terrorism and effective death
 
07:39:22.388 --> 07:39:22.398 align:start position:0%
penalty act 1995 after oklahoma city the
 
07:39:23.990 --> 07:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
argument was we have to start executing
 
07:39:26.150 --> 07:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
people faster people are using the
 
07:39:27.830 --> 07:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
appeal system to the advantage of just
 
07:39:29.990 --> 07:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
milking it forever well it turns out the
 
07:39:32.948 --> 07:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
adpa actually slows down the process of
 
07:39:34.310 --> 07:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
executing people
 
07:39:36.548 --> 07:39:36.558 align:start position:0%
and it limits your appeals
 
07:39:38.150 --> 07:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
so you get one appeal one year after
 
07:39:40.468 --> 07:39:40.478 align:start position:0%
conviction that's it you can't even if
 
07:39:41.830 --> 07:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
the law changes to your benefit you
 
07:39:43.110 --> 07:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
can't reappeal you have to wait for a
 
07:39:43.120 --> 07:39:44.388 align:start position:0%
can't reappeal you have to wait for a
constitutional

07:39:44.388 --> 07:39:44.398 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
07:39:48.230 --> 07:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:50.388 --> 07:39:50.398 align:start position:0%
overreach yeah it has to i can't figure
 
07:39:52.070 --> 07:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
the right name but anyway point is it's
 
07:39:54.548 --> 07:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
all corrupt just end the charade we're
 
07:39:56.468 --> 07:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
not here to go burn american flags we
 
07:39:57.590 --> 07:39:57.600 align:start position:0%

07:40:00.230 --> 07:40:00.240 align:start position:0%

07:40:08.868 --> 07:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh the chair recognized uh carla garrick
 
07:40:12.548 --> 07:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:16.708 --> 07:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:18.468 --> 07:40:18.478 align:start position:0%
i wish there was this much
 
07:40:20.548 --> 07:40:20.558 align:start position:0%
uh who supports the bill says five
 
07:40:22.310 --> 07:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
minutes but please if you can get it
 
07:40:23.590 --> 07:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
down to three
 
07:40:26.150 --> 07:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's four minutes when i practiced it
 
07:40:28.788 --> 07:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
but he had 27 minutes so you know i
 
07:40:28.798 --> 07:40:29.510 align:start position:0%
but he had 27 minutes so you know i
think

07:40:29.510 --> 07:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:40:31.110 --> 07:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
he's the legislator that i asked to
 
07:40:32.708 --> 07:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
research the bill
 
07:40:34.868 --> 07:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
and uh to be able to that's why we had
 
07:40:36.548 --> 07:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
him up front i'll go as fast as i can
 
07:40:38.310 --> 07:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
let's do that i always have reasons for
 
07:40:40.388 --> 07:40:40.398 align:start position:0%
my method you know madness
 
07:40:42.948 --> 07:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
but go ahead
 
07:40:45.190 --> 07:40:45.200 align:start position:0%

07:41:01.430 --> 07:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
u.s citizen in 2000 having to take a
 
07:41:03.350 --> 07:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
citizen's test where
 
07:41:05.830 --> 07:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know new americans learn about the
 
07:41:09.030 --> 07:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
constitution and the enumerated things
 
07:41:10.948 --> 07:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
that the federal government is supposed
 
07:41:13.830 --> 07:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
to be limited to doing
 
07:41:15.510 --> 07:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
which isn't much
 
07:41:17.750 --> 07:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm an author i'm an activist and i'm an
 
07:41:20.388 --> 07:41:20.398 align:start position:0%
attorney but i'm also a political
 
07:41:23.510 --> 07:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
refugee to new hampshire moving here in
 
07:41:26.788 --> 07:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
2008 as part of the free state project i
 
07:41:29.510 --> 07:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
was the republican nominee
 
07:41:31.990 --> 07:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire senate in district 20
 
07:41:34.388 --> 07:41:34.398 align:start position:0%
and i received 45 of the vote in the
 
07:41:37.510 --> 07:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
last election i'm now going to run again
 
07:41:40.468 --> 07:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
i'm a proud free stater and like many
 
07:41:43.110 --> 07:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
but not all free staters i support new
 
07:41:45.910 --> 07:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire independence i'm testifying
 
07:41:48.948 --> 07:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
today in support of cacr32
 
07:41:51.510 --> 07:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
because it should always be in the hands
 
07:41:54.708 --> 07:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
of the people how they are governed
 
07:41:57.990 --> 07:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government has failed us it
 
07:42:00.788 --> 07:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
no longer follows the constitution the
 
07:42:02.750 --> 07:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
federal government ushers in
 
07:42:05.190 --> 07:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional wars the federal
 
07:42:07.190 --> 07:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
government hurts our fellow granite
 
07:42:10.310 --> 07:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
staters with its war on drugs which just
 
07:42:13.510 --> 07:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
makes bad personal decisions worse the
 
07:42:15.190 --> 07:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
federal government colluding with the
 
07:42:16.388 --> 07:42:16.398 align:start position:0%
federal reserve
 
07:42:19.270 --> 07:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
makes us all poorer due to the inflation
 
07:42:22.230 --> 07:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
caused by money printing face it granite
 
07:42:25.430 --> 07:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
staters are abused by dc
 
07:42:27.910 --> 07:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
what do we advise victims to do when
 
07:42:29.350 --> 07:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
they're abused
 
07:42:32.070 --> 07:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
we tell them to leave
 
07:42:35.030 --> 07:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
which means we have the right to ask for
 
07:42:36.310 --> 07:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
a divorce
 
07:42:39.350 --> 07:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's all today's proposed amendment is
 
07:42:43.030 --> 07:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
an opportunity a democratic opportunity
 
07:42:45.270 --> 07:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
for granite staters to decide whether
 
07:42:47.270 --> 07:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
our relationship with the federal
 
07:42:50.388 --> 07:42:50.398 align:start position:0%
government is worth salvaging i say it's
 
07:42:53.190 --> 07:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
not and everyone should know we would
 
07:42:55.270 --> 07:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
all be better off if we went our
 
07:42:56.548 --> 07:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
separate ways
 
07:42:59.190 --> 07:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
what are we taught about abusers
 
07:43:02.310 --> 07:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
they will tell you you can never leave
 
07:43:05.030 --> 07:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
they will tell you they will change
 
07:43:08.388 --> 07:43:08.398 align:start position:0%
they might even tell you it's your fault
 
07:43:11.190 --> 07:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
abusers and the federal government are
 
07:43:13.430 --> 07:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
gaslighting liars
 
07:43:15.670 --> 07:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
who cannot be trusted
 
07:43:17.830 --> 07:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
we all know the definition of insanity
 
07:43:20.868 --> 07:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
is doing the same thing over and over
 
07:43:23.510 --> 07:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
and it's your duty to at least create
 
07:43:26.310 --> 07:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for granite staters to
 
07:43:28.868 --> 07:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
decide their own destinies
 
07:43:31.750 --> 07:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
as an impen as an independent nation new
 
07:43:33.430 --> 07:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire would be prosperous and
 
07:43:35.750 --> 07:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
peaceful along the lines of a small
 
07:43:38.388 --> 07:43:38.398 align:start position:0%
successful country like liechtenstein or
 
07:43:40.548 --> 07:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
luxembourg or switzerland
 
07:43:43.190 --> 07:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
we'd have four side four times the size
 
07:43:45.350 --> 07:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
of iceland's population
 
07:43:47.350 --> 07:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
we'd easily be able to work with our
 
07:43:49.430 --> 07:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
neighbors much like the countries in the
 
07:43:51.990 --> 07:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
shenzhen area and europe do many
 
07:43:54.868 --> 07:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
american retirees already receive their
 
07:43:57.030 --> 07:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
social security pensions in foreign
 
07:43:59.030 --> 07:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
countries like mexico
 
07:44:01.030 --> 07:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
no future challenge related to
 
07:44:03.750 --> 07:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
independence is insurmountable where
 
07:44:07.350 --> 07:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's a will there's a way
 
07:44:09.270 --> 07:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
let's see if there's a will
 
07:44:11.030 --> 07:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
there are many compelling reasons to
 
07:44:13.590 --> 07:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
support national divorce and i encourage
 
07:44:15.350 --> 07:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
folks who are curious to visit the
 
07:44:16.628 --> 07:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
foundation for new hampshire
 
07:44:19.430 --> 07:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
independence website i serve on this
 
07:44:23.670 --> 07:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
federally recognized 501 c 3 educational
 
07:44:25.670 --> 07:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofits board and at
 
07:44:25.680 --> 07:44:27.750 align:start position:0%
nonprofits board and at
nhindependents.org

07:44:27.750 --> 07:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
nhindependents.org
 
07:44:31.270 --> 07:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
you'll find hundreds of reasons why you
 
07:44:33.270 --> 07:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
should support a free and independent
 
07:44:35.670 --> 07:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire not least of which would
 
07:44:38.868 --> 07:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
be that we would all be richer if we
 
07:44:40.788 --> 07:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
could keep our hard-earned federal
 
07:44:42.468 --> 07:44:42.478 align:start position:0%
income taxes
 
07:44:44.948 --> 07:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
and that's about 25 000 on average for
 
07:44:46.468 --> 07:44:46.478 align:start position:0%
granite staters so if you just want to
 
07:44:47.830 --> 07:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
be a little richer
 
07:44:49.590 --> 07:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know ask your representatives to
 
07:44:50.788 --> 07:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
support this
 
07:44:54.230 --> 07:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
today your only duty is to the democracy
 
07:44:57.190 --> 07:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
democracy which every single one of you
 
07:44:58.708 --> 07:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
claim to support
 
07:45:01.270 --> 07:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
you need to vote in favor of this
 
07:45:01.280 --> 07:45:02.628 align:start position:0%
you need to vote in favor of this
opportunity

07:45:02.628 --> 07:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
07:45:05.350 --> 07:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
because it's not up to you it's up to
 
07:45:07.430 --> 07:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
individual granite staters
 
07:45:09.990 --> 07:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're called to live free or die state
 
07:45:12.548 --> 07:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
when we become independent will also be
 
07:45:16.230 --> 07:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
the live free and thrive state afford us
 
07:45:18.788 --> 07:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to try
 
07:45:21.590 --> 07:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
i want to just address briefly a couple
 
07:45:23.750 --> 07:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
of things that came up here today
 
07:45:23.760 --> 07:45:25.030 align:start position:0%
of things that came up here today
um

07:45:25.030 --> 07:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:45:28.388 --> 07:45:28.398 align:start position:0%
in 2016 when brexit happened
 
07:45:30.868 --> 07:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh there were several online polls that
 
07:45:34.070 --> 07:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
were done 42 percent of granite staters
 
07:45:36.388 --> 07:45:36.398 align:start position:0%
in two separate polls including one done
 
07:45:39.510 --> 07:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
by the union leader supported a free
 
07:45:42.468 --> 07:45:42.478 align:start position:0%
and independent new hampshire 42 percent
 
07:45:44.948 --> 07:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
we've come a long way since then
 
07:45:47.110 --> 07:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
to the point that representative edwards
 
07:45:49.590 --> 07:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
made uh you know he said he's going to
 
07:45:51.510 --> 07:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
vote against it i think that we should
 
07:45:54.070 --> 07:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
say let's see
 
07:45:56.628 --> 07:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
what the people think that is truly what
 
07:45:59.110 --> 07:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
the role should be here is let's leave
 
07:46:01.030 --> 07:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
it open to the people
 
07:46:04.628 --> 07:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
to uh representative uh brody deshay
 
07:46:06.788 --> 07:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
um you know it's disappointing that you
 
07:46:08.868 --> 07:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
would try and sort of lean into the
 
07:46:10.868 --> 07:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
gaslighting and create this sense of
 
07:46:13.910 --> 07:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
fear where it's like rebellion treason
 
07:46:15.510 --> 07:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know all these things the right of
 
07:46:17.670 --> 07:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
revolution is enshrined in our new
 
07:46:19.510 --> 07:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
07:46:22.150 --> 07:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
and um and so these are just scare
 
07:46:22.160 --> 07:46:23.350 align:start position:0%
and um and so these are just scare
tactics

07:46:23.350 --> 07:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
tactics
 
07:46:23.360 --> 07:46:25.590 align:start position:0%
tactics
uh

07:46:25.590 --> 07:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:46:27.670 --> 07:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
i believe it was
 
07:46:30.868 --> 07:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
you that said the power resides in the
 
07:46:30.878 --> 07:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
you that said the power resides in the
people

07:46:31.990 --> 07:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:46:34.310 --> 07:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
so i would say let's prove it let's let
 
07:46:36.150 --> 07:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
them vote and then i will leave you with
 
07:46:37.910 --> 07:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
this especially for my democratic
 
07:46:40.628 --> 07:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
friends if you've tweeted or mentioned
 
07:46:43.190 --> 07:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
the words voter rights or democracy in
 
07:46:44.948 --> 07:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
the past five years
 
07:46:47.830 --> 07:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
i suggest you also support this bill i'd
 
07:46:53.990 --> 07:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:55.990 --> 07:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you know my mike's not on yeah
 
07:46:58.230 --> 07:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
no mine's just no you know i i didn't
 
07:47:00.548 --> 07:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
know uh i forgot about the free stated
 
07:47:01.830 --> 07:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
thing how many out here are all free
 
07:47:01.840 --> 07:47:03.990 align:start position:0%
thing how many out here are all free
status

07:47:03.990 --> 07:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
status
 
07:47:05.830 --> 07:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
wow okay
 
07:47:07.670 --> 07:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
quite a bit all right
 
07:47:10.150 --> 07:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay that explains uh mike what's the
 
07:47:11.750 --> 07:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
relevance of that question well the
 
07:47:14.468 --> 07:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
reason is because i'm i'm just concerned
 
07:47:16.310 --> 07:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
on the free status because i know
 
07:47:18.230 --> 07:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
you do a great job on liberty and how
 
07:47:20.070 --> 07:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
you you know where you're going
 
07:47:21.830 --> 07:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
on freedoms and other things that you
 
07:47:24.230 --> 07:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
want and drugs and everything else and
 
07:47:26.628 --> 07:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
no regulations and i understand
 
07:47:30.070 --> 07:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
so uh you know okay
 
07:47:31.910 --> 07:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
with the characterization there well i
 
07:47:33.510 --> 07:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to see how many free status
 
07:47:35.270 --> 07:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
came in to testify that's all quite a
 
07:47:36.948 --> 07:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
bit so
 
07:47:38.708 --> 07:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
that's good okay thank you and then
 
07:47:40.150 --> 07:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
sorry i would just like to make one more
 
07:47:41.910 --> 07:47:41.920 align:start position:0%

appreciate your time and thanks for
 
07:50:02.868 --> 07:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
everyone for coming out i have a few
 
07:50:04.548 --> 07:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks but like carla did i
 
07:50:06.548 --> 07:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond quickly to some things
 
07:50:08.708 --> 07:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
some other folks said we had one speaker
 
07:50:10.628 --> 07:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
who referenced time and again
 
07:50:13.190 --> 07:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
experts and i would just say that we
 
07:50:15.350 --> 07:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
here can rely on common sense and our
 
07:50:16.788 --> 07:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
own critical thinking if we want to look
 
07:50:18.868 --> 07:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
to an expert on the constitution i would
 
07:50:21.590 --> 07:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
put forth lysander spooner
 
07:50:23.910 --> 07:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about wars and call them civil
 
07:50:25.190 --> 07:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
war i would
 
07:50:28.070 --> 07:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
i would reference the great axel rose
 
07:50:30.150 --> 07:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
when he said what's so civil about war
 
07:50:30.160 --> 07:50:31.830 align:start position:0%
when he said what's so civil about war
anyway

07:50:31.830 --> 07:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
07:50:33.430 --> 07:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's been talk about money going out
 
07:50:34.708 --> 07:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and money coming back
 
07:50:36.310 --> 07:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire i just want to make
 
07:50:38.548 --> 07:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
clear that those federal reserve notes
 
07:50:41.190 --> 07:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
are not the same for example what if the
 
07:50:43.350 --> 07:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire residents
 
07:50:45.430 --> 07:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
were taxed at a billion dollars but then
 
07:50:47.590 --> 07:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
the dc regime said here's 10 billion
 
07:50:48.708 --> 07:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
dollars we're going to we're going to
 
07:50:51.430 --> 07:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
put in a nuclear waste facility in the
 
07:50:52.708 --> 07:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
in the white mountains we're going to do
 
07:50:54.708 --> 07:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
all these super funds we're gonna you
 
07:50:55.670 --> 07:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
know so
 
07:50:57.270 --> 07:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
so we have to think about
 
07:50:59.110 --> 07:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
what comes with these grants
 
07:51:01.190 --> 07:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
and how it affects folks
 
07:51:03.590 --> 07:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
we also know that there's been questions
 
07:51:05.270 --> 07:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
how will this policy how this program
 
07:51:07.830 --> 07:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
unfold we don't know for sure no one can
 
07:51:09.350 --> 07:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
answer that but we know there's a lot of
 
07:51:10.548 --> 07:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
smart people here there's a lot of
 
07:51:12.708 --> 07:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
people with passion and we'll work to to
 
07:51:14.948 --> 07:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
bring about the best outcomes we can and
 
07:51:18.628 --> 07:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
it's better to have a less acute
 
07:51:20.628 --> 07:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
issue than a more acute issue we know
 
07:51:20.638 --> 07:51:21.350 align:start position:0%
issue than a more acute issue we know
that

07:51:21.350 --> 07:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:51:22.708 --> 07:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
i'll get to my
 
07:51:25.030 --> 07:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks i would say i would be
 
07:51:26.868 --> 07:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
content with each of you
 
07:51:29.190 --> 07:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
supporting this with neutrality just to
 
07:51:30.788 --> 07:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
see how folks
 
07:51:32.708 --> 07:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire respond but i would
 
07:51:35.350 --> 07:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
encourage you enthusiastic support
 
07:51:37.350 --> 07:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
i i would say that i've been an advocate
 
07:51:39.590 --> 07:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
of liberty for a long time i used to be
 
07:51:41.590 --> 07:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
sort of bought into the nationalism i've
 
07:51:43.670 --> 07:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
since seen through some of that
 
07:51:45.430 --> 07:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
part of that was through my reading of
 
07:51:47.830 --> 07:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
history and the history of empire seeing
 
07:51:50.948 --> 07:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
them grow and fade and what that brings
 
07:51:50.958 --> 07:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
them grow and fade and what that brings
so

07:51:51.750 --> 07:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:51:53.350 --> 07:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
what i see i don't think anyone here
 
07:51:55.270 --> 07:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
would deny that the us has been an
 
07:51:57.350 --> 07:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
empire and it's on the
 
07:51:59.350 --> 07:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh collapsing phase
 
07:52:02.070 --> 07:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
empires at their cores tend to be
 
07:52:04.788 --> 07:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
conformist uniformists they have group
 
07:52:07.270 --> 07:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
think they stagnate they thrive on fear
 
07:52:10.548 --> 07:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
and aggression and even we see democide
 
07:52:12.310 --> 07:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
on the periphery though is where we see
 
07:52:15.030 --> 07:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
creativity diversity critical thinking
 
07:52:17.190 --> 07:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
innovation mutual respect and peace and
 
07:52:18.548 --> 07:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
that's what i think we can do here in
 
07:52:20.468 --> 07:52:20.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the culture
 
07:52:21.910 --> 07:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
is that it's not just freedom it's
 
07:52:24.628 --> 07:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
freedom coupled with responsibility
 
07:52:24.638 --> 07:52:25.430 align:start position:0%
freedom coupled with responsibility
and

07:52:25.430 --> 07:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:52:27.110 --> 07:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
so i would ask you who best governed
 
07:52:29.510 --> 07:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
your life i wouldn't pretend to say i
 
07:52:31.990 --> 07:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
know i can go shopping for you i could
 
07:52:33.430 --> 07:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
plan your vacation for you all these
 
07:52:35.750 --> 07:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
things we we each individually know our
 
07:52:38.150 --> 07:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
preferences we have the tacit knowledge
 
07:52:40.948 --> 07:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
relevant we know our incentives and
 
07:52:43.110 --> 07:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
the same is true i think we here can
 
07:52:45.190 --> 07:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
govern ourselves much better than some
 
07:52:46.948 --> 07:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
strangers even if they're experts even
 
07:52:48.868 --> 07:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
if they're geniuses hundreds of miles
 
07:52:51.990 --> 07:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
away who claim the ability to do this
 
07:52:54.070 --> 07:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
for a third of a billion people we have
 
07:52:56.628 --> 07:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
an opportunity today to to
 
07:52:58.868 --> 07:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
peacefully evolve away from that and i
 
07:53:00.468 --> 07:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
think uh it's
 
07:53:00.478 --> 07:53:01.430 align:start position:0%
think uh it's
uh

07:53:01.430 --> 07:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:53:03.670 --> 07:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
to speak to the gentleman uh
 
07:53:05.830 --> 07:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
politics always lags and it's and
 
07:53:07.510 --> 07:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's been talk of independence
 
07:53:09.670 --> 07:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
movements in various states for years
 
07:53:11.750 --> 07:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
now and we're seeing that come
 
07:53:13.430 --> 07:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
become more serious and i think for good
 
07:53:14.948 --> 07:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
reason because the
 
07:53:16.548 --> 07:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
american empire is
 
07:53:16.558 --> 07:53:17.510 align:start position:0%
american empire is
is

07:53:17.510 --> 07:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:53:19.510 --> 07:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
very clearly seen to be based on
 
07:53:19.520 --> 07:53:20.548 align:start position:0%
very clearly seen to be based on
violence

07:53:20.548 --> 07:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
violence
 
07:53:20.558 --> 07:53:21.430 align:start position:0%
violence
and

07:53:21.430 --> 07:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:53:23.110 --> 07:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's time we move past that and we can
 
07:53:25.350 --> 07:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
do better and it's possible to thrive
 
07:53:27.990 --> 07:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
while things around us are collapsing
 
07:53:28.000 --> 07:53:29.830 align:start position:0%
while things around us are collapsing
okay

07:53:29.830 --> 07:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:53:31.990 --> 07:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you um
 
07:53:34.708 --> 07:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
are there any questions seeing none
 
07:53:38.868 --> 07:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:43.430 --> 07:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:45.030 --> 07:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
boy i butchered some names there that's
 
07:53:46.628 --> 07:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
07:53:47.990 --> 07:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
so if i butcher your name let me
 
07:53:50.070 --> 07:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
apologize in advance all right
 
07:53:52.230 --> 07:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's okay i've heard worse all right
 
07:53:53.830 --> 07:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
and he supports the bill you got one
 
07:53:56.788 --> 07:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
minute i like that go ahead yeah so i've
 
07:53:58.070 --> 07:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
had this whole prepared statement but
 
07:53:59.350 --> 07:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'm throwing it out i'll probably it's
 
07:54:00.548 --> 07:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
written down so i'll pass it up at the
 
07:54:02.628 --> 07:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
end but seeing as my family first came
 
07:54:05.590 --> 07:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
to you came to north america in 1620 i
 
07:54:07.110 --> 07:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
think i'm probably fairly qualified to
 
07:54:08.468 --> 07:54:08.478 align:start position:0%
answer the question of
 
07:54:10.310 --> 07:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
what would these people think about what
 
07:54:12.070 --> 07:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing today they'd be ashamed that
 
07:54:13.990 --> 07:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
anyone had the audacity to stand here
 
07:54:15.830 --> 07:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
and act like we have to be loyal to dead
 
07:54:17.750 --> 07:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
people that dead people are the ones who
 
07:54:19.670 --> 07:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
governors rather than us governing
 
07:54:19.680 --> 07:54:21.110 align:start position:0%
governors rather than us governing
ourselves

07:54:21.110 --> 07:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
07:54:22.548 --> 07:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
ultimately this is a question of who
 
07:54:24.468 --> 07:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
governs who do the people of new
 
07:54:26.070 --> 07:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire govern themselves are they
 
07:54:28.548 --> 07:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
governed by washington d.c or are they
 
07:54:29.910 --> 07:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
governed by people who live more than
 
07:54:32.388 --> 07:54:32.398 align:start position:0%
200 years ago
 
07:54:34.948 --> 07:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have to say
 
07:54:34.958 --> 07:54:35.830 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have to say
okay

07:54:35.830 --> 07:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:54:37.270 --> 07:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:54:39.510 --> 07:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
i i was thinking that in my mind about
 
07:54:41.190 --> 07:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
governing i
 
07:54:43.030 --> 07:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
i don't nobody's governing me that's for
 
07:54:46.468 --> 07:54:46.478 align:start position:0%
sure but anyways um
 
07:54:47.990 --> 07:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
07:54:49.670 --> 07:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
that sounded like a question
 
07:54:51.510 --> 07:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
no i'm just saying i mean i live a lot
 
07:54:53.430 --> 07:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired marine and i live a life i
 
07:54:54.388 --> 07:54:54.398 align:start position:0%
don't you don't think the federal
 
07:54:56.708 --> 07:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
government governs you no not at all so
 
07:54:58.310 --> 07:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
they don't write the laws to which you
 
07:54:59.910 --> 07:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
are compelled to obey well the state of
 
07:55:01.510 --> 07:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire probably does the same
 
07:55:01.520 --> 07:55:02.388 align:start position:0%
new hampshire probably does the same
thing

07:55:02.388 --> 07:55:02.398 align:start position:0%
thing
 
07:55:03.750 --> 07:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes but does new hampshire govern itself
 
07:55:05.270 --> 07:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
or does the federal government
 
07:55:06.468 --> 07:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire governs themselves but
 
07:55:08.310 --> 07:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
they also over the years taken a lot of
 
07:55:08.320 --> 07:55:09.270 align:start position:0%
they also over the years taken a lot of
carrots

07:55:09.270 --> 07:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
carrots
 
07:55:11.510 --> 07:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
and they've taken a lot of funding and
 
07:55:13.350 --> 07:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
they agreed to certain things which i
 
07:55:14.948 --> 07:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
totally disagreed for me i didn't agree
 
07:55:16.708 --> 07:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
to any of that did you no you then you
 
07:55:18.548 --> 07:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
need to run for state rep then
 
07:55:20.310 --> 07:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
i have run for state rep also ran for
 
07:55:22.230 --> 07:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
sheriff okay well most of the people in
 
07:55:24.628 --> 07:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
this room have run for something okay uh
 
07:55:25.990 --> 07:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
and of course you all know that the
 
07:55:27.910 --> 07:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
state is not a uh is not a home rule
 
07:55:29.830 --> 07:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
state we're a dillon state where the
 
07:55:32.070 --> 07:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
legislators make the decisions uh on
 
07:55:33.830 --> 07:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of the people you know that right
 
07:55:35.030 --> 07:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
do you truly believe the federal
 
07:55:36.868 --> 07:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
government doesn't govern you well i'm
 
07:55:38.150 --> 07:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
not going to answer i'm not going to sit
 
07:55:39.430 --> 07:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
here and keep going back and forth
 
07:55:41.430 --> 07:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's a really simple question it is i
 
07:55:42.548 --> 07:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
i don't think the federal government
 
07:55:44.388 --> 07:55:44.398 align:start position:0%
runs my life i
 
07:55:46.310 --> 07:55:46.320 align:start position:0%

who's next is
 
07:55:59.190 --> 07:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:00.948 --> 07:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
welcome chris
 
07:56:02.230 --> 07:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you can get it down to
 
07:56:03.750 --> 07:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
07:56:05.670 --> 07:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
i get about 20 cards here that i want to
 
07:56:06.868 --> 07:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
get through
 
07:56:11.030 --> 07:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:12.708 --> 07:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
my name is chris streetman and i'm from
 
07:56:15.030 --> 07:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
alstead i'm a small business owner an
 
07:56:16.628 --> 07:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
employer a veteran a planning board
 
07:56:18.788 --> 07:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
member and former selectmen
 
07:56:20.868 --> 07:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
i come here today to express my support
 
07:56:23.270 --> 07:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
for cacr32
 
07:56:25.270 --> 07:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
most citizens may not realize that this
 
07:56:28.310 --> 07:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
is not our first rodeo we spent seven
 
07:56:30.708 --> 07:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
years in open rebellion against the
 
07:56:34.070 --> 07:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
crown before we gained our independence
 
07:56:35.510 --> 07:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
07:56:37.910 --> 07:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
at issue is whether the citizens of new
 
07:56:39.910 --> 07:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire are better served by special
 
07:56:41.670 --> 07:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
interests in washington
 
07:56:43.430 --> 07:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
or by you
 
07:56:46.788 --> 07:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:48.628 --> 07:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire no longer has a seat at
 
07:56:50.548 --> 07:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
the nationals table
 
07:56:52.388 --> 07:56:52.398 align:start position:0%
since the passage of the 17th amendment
 
07:56:55.670 --> 07:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
in 1913 no state has any representation
 
07:56:57.990 --> 07:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
any longer at the national level the
 
07:56:59.590 --> 07:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
three-legged stool
 
07:57:01.910 --> 07:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
envisioned by the framers is mutated now
 
07:57:04.310 --> 07:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
the central government has its president
 
07:57:06.070 --> 07:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
the people still have their congress
 
07:57:09.750 --> 07:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
person who represents on average 708 000
 
07:57:09.760 --> 07:57:13.270 align:start position:0%
person who represents on average 708 000
people

07:57:13.270 --> 07:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:14.868 --> 07:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
but the senate now represents the
 
07:57:17.590 --> 07:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
special interest groups
 
07:57:19.910 --> 07:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
75 million dollar
 
07:57:22.868 --> 07:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
campaigns for a senate seat
 
07:57:22.878 --> 07:57:24.468 align:start position:0%
campaigns for a senate seat
really

07:57:24.468 --> 07:57:24.478 align:start position:0%
really
 
07:57:26.388 --> 07:57:26.398 align:start position:0%
that change is significant it
 
07:57:28.628 --> 07:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
strategically altered it completely
 
07:57:28.638 --> 07:57:29.910 align:start position:0%
strategically altered it completely
altered

07:57:29.910 --> 07:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
altered
 
07:57:32.230 --> 07:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
what we signed up for
 
07:57:35.670 --> 07:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire joined the union
 
07:57:38.868 --> 07:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's not the same country that we agreed
 
07:57:41.510 --> 07:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
to sign onto
 
07:57:44.310 --> 07:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
it altered the structure
 
07:57:46.788 --> 07:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
my question is this if new hampshire was
 
07:57:49.030 --> 07:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
independent right now let's
 
07:57:51.830 --> 07:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
put let this be your mindset
 
07:57:54.150 --> 07:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
we are in an independent new hampshire
 
07:57:57.190 --> 07:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
and a bunch of guys come from dc
 
07:57:59.510 --> 07:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
and they're going to pitch us on joining
 
07:58:01.190 --> 07:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
their government
 
07:58:03.590 --> 07:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
what would the pitch be
 
07:58:06.070 --> 07:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
do you like huge monolithic
 
07:58:09.510 --> 07:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies we have to borrow
 
07:58:11.270 --> 07:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
just to do what we do but we still
 
07:58:13.190 --> 07:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
choose to do more how about decisions
 
07:58:14.548 --> 07:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
made by special interest groups and
 
07:58:18.708 --> 07:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:21.270 --> 07:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have wars and we're gonna
 
07:58:23.910 --> 07:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
send your sons and daughters into wars
 
07:58:25.750 --> 07:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that we can't even afford or pay
 
07:58:27.990 --> 07:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
for uh we're not even gonna follow the
 
07:58:30.628 --> 07:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
constitution when we do send those in
 
07:58:33.270 --> 07:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
and but you are going to have to
 
07:58:36.310 --> 07:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
follow what our regulatory behemoth says
 
07:58:37.590 --> 07:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
you must do
 
07:58:39.590 --> 07:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and you're going to pay for it we're
 
07:58:42.628 --> 07:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
going to tax you and send all that money
 
07:58:43.990 --> 07:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
to dc
 
07:58:46.388 --> 07:58:46.398 align:start position:0%
uh what do you say
 
07:58:48.788 --> 07:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
it's insane the people of new hampshire
 
07:58:50.788 --> 07:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
would never take it if you look at the
 
07:58:53.350 --> 07:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
state of the united states today you
 
07:58:55.110 --> 07:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't sell it to the very people
 
07:58:57.990 --> 07:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking to
 
07:59:00.788 --> 07:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
do any of you seriously think
 
07:59:02.708 --> 07:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
that there
 
07:59:05.190 --> 07:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
that this whole talk of national divorce
 
07:59:07.510 --> 07:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's occurring across the country not
 
07:59:10.868 --> 07:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
a day goes by in my news feed
 
07:59:12.948 --> 07:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
when it doesn't pop up when another
 
07:59:15.110 --> 07:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
article written or another editorial
 
07:59:17.270 --> 07:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't pop up where people are
 
07:59:17.280 --> 07:59:18.388 align:start position:0%
doesn't pop up where people are
wondering

07:59:18.388 --> 07:59:18.398 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
07:59:22.150 --> 07:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
whether people are best served by dc
 
07:59:24.150 --> 07:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
this is a question it's not a question
 
07:59:26.868 --> 07:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
that we're just asking here in new
 
07:59:29.590 --> 07:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire a bunch of crazy free staters
 
07:59:31.670 --> 07:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
and people are just asking it's asked
 
07:59:35.110 --> 07:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:37.270 --> 07:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
besides the failings of government our
 
07:59:38.948 --> 07:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
country has devolved into political
 
07:59:41.510 --> 07:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
parties always at war over power
 
07:59:43.350 --> 07:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
oligarchs who paid the price to play and
 
07:59:44.788 --> 07:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
those who were forced to pay the bills
 
07:59:48.788 --> 07:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:50.868 --> 07:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
there is bipartisan support for a
 
07:59:50.878 --> 07:59:52.230 align:start position:0%
there is bipartisan support for a
national

07:59:52.230 --> 07:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
national
 
07:59:54.548 --> 07:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
divorce and i suspect we have the same
 
07:59:57.110 --> 07:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support in the people of new
 
07:59:57.120 --> 07:59:58.150 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support in the people of new
hampshire

07:59:58.150 --> 07:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:00:00.468 --> 08:00:00.478 align:start position:0%
i think you need to give them the right
 
08:00:02.708 --> 08:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
to see that question
 
08:00:05.030 --> 08:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what's a that
 
08:00:06.868 --> 08:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
that's all right if you can close it up
 
08:00:06.878 --> 08:00:07.590 align:start position:0%
that's all right if you can close it up
that's

08:00:07.590 --> 08:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
08:00:09.350 --> 08:00:09.360 align:start position:0%

in two minutes

08:00:55.350 --> 08:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:56.548 --> 08:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
you said you were
 
08:00:58.310 --> 08:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
you were a marine and you don't believe
 
08:01:00.788 --> 08:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
with federal excuse me i'm not if anyone
 
08:01:02.628 --> 08:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
served in the marines when we weren't
 
08:01:04.548 --> 08:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
were we are back
 
08:01:06.388 --> 08:01:06.398 align:start position:0%
all right you you said you are and
 
08:01:08.150 --> 08:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
somehow you still are but the federal
 
08:01:10.628 --> 08:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
government doesn't run your life so this
 
08:01:12.468 --> 08:01:12.478 align:start position:0%
must mean that you're just okay with
 
08:01:15.350 --> 08:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
things that i'm not okay with
 
08:01:17.750 --> 08:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
war is all across the world every day
 
08:01:19.510 --> 08:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
people dying
 
08:01:22.310 --> 08:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
my dad was in the army for 26 years
 
08:01:24.868 --> 08:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
by the way that's why i'm a free stater
 
08:01:27.590 --> 08:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have a state that i'm from
 
08:01:29.750 --> 08:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
i moved every three years of my life and
 
08:01:31.910 --> 08:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
i chose new hampshire
 
08:01:34.070 --> 08:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
because when covet happened and i lived
 
08:01:35.750 --> 08:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
in texas at the time
 
08:01:37.590 --> 08:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
texans just rolled over
 
08:01:38.868 --> 08:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
and i heard
 
08:01:40.230 --> 08:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
on the radio
 
08:01:41.910 --> 08:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
about people in new hampshire free
 
08:01:44.708 --> 08:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
staters who were deciding
 
08:01:45.990 --> 08:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to just roll over and
 
08:01:48.150 --> 08:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
take it we're going to
 
08:01:50.070 --> 08:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
not listen to the rules that are going
 
08:01:52.388 --> 08:01:52.398 align:start position:0%
on ruining people's lives and businesses
 
08:01:53.750 --> 08:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
and livelihoods
 
08:01:55.190 --> 08:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that's that's why i moved here i
 
08:01:57.430 --> 08:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
haven't had to
 
08:01:59.110 --> 08:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
i haven't had to change my life a bit
 
08:02:01.030 --> 08:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
since i moved here because there are
 
08:02:03.030 --> 08:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
people here who are moving to new
 
08:02:04.948 --> 08:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire because new hampshire is
 
08:02:06.230 --> 08:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the live free or die
 
08:02:06.240 --> 08:02:07.190 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the live free or die
state

08:02:07.190 --> 08:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
08:02:09.270 --> 08:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
where we don't just take crap from
 
08:02:11.670 --> 08:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
people who decide that they can control
 
08:02:13.590 --> 08:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
our lives that includes the federal
 
08:02:15.270 --> 08:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
government the federal government was
 
08:02:15.280 --> 08:02:16.150 align:start position:0%
government the federal government was
never

08:02:16.150 --> 08:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
never
 
08:02:18.628 --> 08:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
i mean i've never voted i mean i mean
 
08:02:20.548 --> 08:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
never voted for the uh
 
08:02:22.708 --> 08:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
the federal government to exist well i
 
08:02:24.548 --> 08:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
was just born into it i didn't get to
 
08:02:26.388 --> 08:02:26.398 align:start position:0%
sign a contract there's no implicit
 
08:02:26.398 --> 08:02:29.190 align:start position:0%
sign a contract there's no implicit
contract

08:02:29.190 --> 08:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:31.350 --> 08:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's why free staters are choosing new
 
08:02:34.310 --> 08:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire to move to because there's
 
08:02:37.430 --> 08:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
already a culture here of
 
08:02:37.440 --> 08:02:39.830 align:start position:0%
already a culture here of
peaceful

08:02:39.830 --> 08:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
peaceful
 
08:02:41.670 --> 08:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
just leave me alone ism live for your
 
08:02:43.350 --> 08:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
die that's what it is
 
08:02:45.030 --> 08:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i just i really resent the fact that
 
08:02:48.788 --> 08:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
you um are acting like you're going to
 
08:02:48.798 --> 08:02:49.990 align:start position:0%
you um are acting like you're going to
be

08:02:49.990 --> 08:02:50.000 align:start position:0%

you do i had a a
 
08:04:38.388 --> 08:04:38.398 align:start position:0%
a point i was going to make in opposing
 
08:04:45.430 --> 08:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:49.190 --> 08:04:49.200 align:start position:0%

08:04:55.990 --> 08:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
welcome i'm gonna try not to treat you
 
08:04:59.110 --> 08:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
too bad okay thank you
 
08:05:00.310 --> 08:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much committee
 
08:05:02.230 --> 08:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak um i have some
 
08:05:03.990 --> 08:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
remarks a few representatives made some
 
08:05:05.430 --> 08:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
points i wanted to clear up i believe
 
08:05:07.110 --> 08:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative said we wouldn't have
 
08:05:08.868 --> 08:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
medicare social security anymore
 
08:05:10.788 --> 08:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
medicare is federal medicaid is state
 
08:05:13.030 --> 08:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
federal but social security if you move
 
08:05:14.948 --> 08:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
to any other country pretty much any
 
08:05:16.070 --> 08:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
other country you will still get social
 
08:05:17.430 --> 08:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
security so that wasn't uh totally
 
08:05:19.750 --> 08:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
accurate but uh more important though if
 
08:05:22.628 --> 08:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
we left we'd all be saving 20 30 40 on
 
08:05:24.150 --> 08:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
federal income taxes federal corporate
 
08:05:26.310 --> 08:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
taxes and 100 other taxes or so we'd all
 
08:05:28.708 --> 08:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
have 20 30 40 000 more in our pockets we
 
08:05:30.468 --> 08:05:30.478 align:start position:0%
could afford insurance as for those who
 
08:05:31.510 --> 08:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
paid into medicare and they're already
 
08:05:33.030 --> 08:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
70 and can't necessarily work and save
 
08:05:35.430 --> 08:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
up any more by private insurance we will
 
08:05:37.270 --> 08:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
arrange during secession no one's going
 
08:05:38.628 --> 08:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
to say you know we leave and next day
 
08:05:40.548 --> 08:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
we're gone and you know no negotiations
 
08:05:42.230 --> 08:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
like brexit there will be months or
 
08:05:44.310 --> 08:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
years of negotiations those who are 70
 
08:05:45.750 --> 08:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
and worked hard like some people in this
 
08:05:47.670 --> 08:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
body will get medicare because they paid
 
08:05:49.510 --> 08:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
into it so you know it's not that simple
 
08:05:50.468 --> 08:05:50.478 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna let him die on the
 
08:05:50.478 --> 08:05:51.430 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna let him die on the
streets

08:05:51.430 --> 08:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
streets
 
08:05:54.070 --> 08:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
i believe jess edwards said he agrees
 
08:05:55.350 --> 08:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
with some of our points but at this
 
08:05:57.030 --> 08:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
point he thinks he would vote no um but
 
08:05:58.150 --> 08:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
it seems like he's coming along so i
 
08:05:59.350 --> 08:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
think in a few months he might support
 
08:06:01.030 --> 08:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
the session uh he said if you don't
 
08:06:02.548 --> 08:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
agree with it just run for office or
 
08:06:04.388 --> 08:06:04.398 align:start position:0%
vote harder again with all due respect
 
08:06:05.830 --> 08:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
um obviously i respect representative
 
08:06:07.110 --> 08:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
edwards but he said just run for
 
08:06:09.270 --> 08:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
congress we've tried that exact method
 
08:06:10.628 --> 08:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
run for congress and support was running
 
08:06:13.430 --> 08:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
for 240 years every day so me i'm not
 
08:06:15.350 --> 08:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
that old my father my father's father
 
08:06:16.708 --> 08:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
yeah my father's father was an army
 
08:06:18.230 --> 08:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
judge plenty of family in the military
 
08:06:19.830 --> 08:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
they served the federal government right
 
08:06:19.840 --> 08:06:20.868 align:start position:0%
they served the federal government right
now

08:06:20.868 --> 08:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
08:06:21.990 --> 08:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think they would you know they
 
08:06:23.110 --> 08:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support the federal government
 
08:06:24.468 --> 08:06:24.478 align:start position:0%
anymore my grandfather i don't think he
 
08:06:26.788 --> 08:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
just passed away but we've tried that
 
08:06:28.388 --> 08:06:28.398 align:start position:0%
exact method for 20 to 40 years the
 
08:06:29.750 --> 08:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
definition of insanity is literally
 
08:06:31.350 --> 08:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
trying the same thing every day again
 
08:06:33.030 --> 08:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
and again for 240 years and expecting a
 
08:06:34.548 --> 08:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
different result does anyone in this
 
08:06:35.910 --> 08:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
body i haven't heard from any person in
 
08:06:37.430 --> 08:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
the world who thinks who has explained
 
08:06:39.910 --> 08:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
to me a proper actual methodology for
 
08:06:41.910 --> 08:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
how we're going to change the track the
 
08:06:43.270 --> 08:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
trend of the federal government the
 
08:06:44.868 --> 08:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
federal government every day for 240
 
08:06:47.030 --> 08:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
years has become bigger expanded and
 
08:06:48.708 --> 08:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
minimized our liberties crushed our
 
08:06:50.788 --> 08:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
natural human rights
 
08:06:51.910 --> 08:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
what is the reason to believe that it's
 
08:06:53.510 --> 08:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to change in 2020 it'll change in
 
08:06:55.590 --> 08:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
2024 it'll change we'll win by congress
 
08:06:57.110 --> 08:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
both parties have had full control
 
08:06:58.708 --> 08:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed it either grows
 
08:07:01.190 --> 08:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
extremely fast or it grows super fast
 
08:07:02.310 --> 08:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
there's no big difference it's always
 
08:07:04.070 --> 08:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
growing super fast or extremely fast um
 
08:07:05.590 --> 08:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
again i've asked representative to the
 
08:07:06.948 --> 08:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
chase to debate me he declined he does
 
08:07:08.230 --> 08:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
not want to debate me i've asked any
 
08:07:10.070 --> 08:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislator any legislator or anyone else
 
08:07:12.070 --> 08:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
to debate me on independence nobody one
 
08:07:13.670 --> 08:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
person debated me a few weeks ago i
 
08:07:14.628 --> 08:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
technically won the debate it was a
 
08:07:15.750 --> 08:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
great debate we need to have this
 
08:07:17.670 --> 08:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
discussion any legislator in this body
 
08:07:19.430 --> 08:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
or anywhere you did buy me a cup of
 
08:07:21.190 --> 08:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
coffee by the way yeah yeah thank you
 
08:07:23.270 --> 08:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay yeah for the record yeah anyone who
 
08:07:24.548 --> 08:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
wants to debate me i'm very happy to
 
08:07:25.590 --> 08:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
debate i think we should have a public
 
08:07:27.030 --> 08:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
debate um as for the constitution
 
08:07:28.070 --> 08:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative deschez brought up the
 
08:07:29.510 --> 08:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
constitution a few times and i think
 
08:07:30.788 --> 08:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
that's a very interesting point number
 
08:07:32.628 --> 08:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
one as as i'm sure some will mention
 
08:07:34.310 --> 08:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
about lysander spooner i never signed
 
08:07:35.910 --> 08:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
the contract the theory that my
 
08:07:37.430 --> 08:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
great-great-grandfather theoretically
 
08:07:39.030 --> 08:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
assuming they lived in the united states
 
08:07:40.430 --> 08:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
and weren't immigrants my
 
08:07:40.440 --> 08:07:41.430 align:start position:0%
and weren't immigrants my
great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather

08:07:41.430 --> 08:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather
 
08:07:44.070 --> 08:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
24 years ago signed a contract binding b
 
08:07:45.990 --> 08:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
all contract law in the world would deny
 
08:07:48.070 --> 08:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
that that is legitimate i cannot bind my
 
08:07:50.150 --> 08:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
son let alone my grandson in perpetuity
 
08:07:51.830 --> 08:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
to be a slave to anyone else right i can
 
08:07:53.350 --> 08:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
sign a contract for me and i have
 
08:07:55.910 --> 08:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
limited custodial powers over my son if
 
08:07:57.510 --> 08:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're five years old but i can't say
 
08:07:59.350 --> 08:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
my grandfather my grandson will be a
 
08:08:02.388 --> 08:08:02.398 align:start position:0%
slave to you in 200 years so the fact
 
08:08:03.750 --> 08:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
that anyone says the constitution's a
 
08:08:06.388 --> 08:08:06.398 align:start position:0%
contract is total bogus all contract law
 
08:08:07.750 --> 08:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
would agree with that in the world look
 
08:08:09.270 --> 08:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
at any contract law in the universe you
 
08:08:10.548 --> 08:08:10.558 align:start position:0%
can't if you you can't if you didn't
 
08:08:12.388 --> 08:08:12.398 align:start position:0%
sign the contract under informed consent
 
08:08:14.548 --> 08:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
if someone 240 years ago signed a
 
08:08:16.628 --> 08:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
contract to say that that applies to you
 
08:08:18.150 --> 08:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
but even let's say the constitution is
 
08:08:20.230 --> 08:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
legitimate and just full disclosure full
 
08:08:21.590 --> 08:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
openly to the federal government i
 
08:08:23.110 --> 08:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
withdraw my consent i never consented to
 
08:08:24.548 --> 08:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
the federal government ruling over me i
 
08:08:25.830 --> 08:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't want you i don't want your money i
 
08:08:27.430 --> 08:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
don't want your laws but if we're gonna
 
08:08:28.708 --> 08:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
talk about the constitution and i think
 
08:08:30.310 --> 08:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
the shay's mentioned a few times it's
 
08:08:31.830 --> 08:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional on its face even though
 
08:08:34.948 --> 08:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
it's not um okay if we are going to obey
 
08:08:36.230 --> 08:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely obey and enforce the
 
08:08:37.910 --> 08:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
constitution who has violated the
 
08:08:39.590 --> 08:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
constitution if it's a contract who has
 
08:08:41.990 --> 08:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
violated it us or them well let's list
 
08:08:43.910 --> 08:08:43.920 align:start position:0%

08:08:47.030 --> 08:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
first amendment many times i've written
 
08:08:48.310 --> 08:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
books about it violated the second
 
08:08:49.510 --> 08:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
amendment many times i've written a book
 
08:08:50.948 --> 08:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
about it violated the fourth and fifth
 
08:08:52.388 --> 08:08:52.398 align:start position:0%
amendment's due process i'm finishing up
 
08:08:54.788 --> 08:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
a book on massive amounts of violations
 
08:08:56.548 --> 08:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
of due process by the federal government
 
08:08:58.230 --> 08:08:58.240 align:start position:0%

08:09:00.388 --> 08:09:00.398 align:start position:0%
eminent domain um acquitted context
 
08:09:02.310 --> 08:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
sentencing felony murder rules uh almost
 
08:09:03.590 --> 08:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
every single federal law warrantless
 
08:09:05.750 --> 08:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
checkpoints cbp surveillance almost all
 
08:09:07.430 --> 08:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
of it comes from dc they have violated
 
08:09:09.030 --> 08:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
the constitution so representative de
 
08:09:10.788 --> 08:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
chaise is saying they are the traitors
 
08:09:12.388 --> 08:09:12.398 align:start position:0%
he is saying they are the traitors you
 
08:09:13.670 --> 08:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
say you want to enforce the constitution
 
08:09:15.910 --> 08:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
the letter of the law everyone in dc i'm
 
08:09:16.948 --> 08:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
not going to say the word but what
 
08:09:18.070 --> 08:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
happens to the traders that's what
 
08:09:19.270 --> 08:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative chase is saying he's
 
08:09:20.948 --> 08:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
saying words traders we want to leave
 
08:09:22.468 --> 08:09:22.478 align:start position:0%
peacefully this is an abusive
 
08:09:24.150 --> 08:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
relationship even if we entered into it
 
08:09:25.830 --> 08:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
voluntarily which nobody here signed any
 
08:09:27.830 --> 08:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
constitution nobody joined the union if
 
08:09:29.190 --> 08:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
we had to join the union today we would
 
08:09:31.110 --> 08:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
vote no if all of you were independent
 
08:09:32.468 --> 08:09:32.478 align:start position:0%
now and have to vote whether to join the
 
08:09:33.910 --> 08:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
union or stay independent i'm sure all
 
08:09:35.670 --> 08:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
of you would not want to join that
 
08:09:37.270 --> 08:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
terrible cluster
 
08:09:39.270 --> 08:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
of what the union is 20 for 29 trillion
 
08:09:40.548 --> 08:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
reasons obviously we would want to
 
08:09:42.230 --> 08:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
remain independent now we are saying we
 
08:09:43.830 --> 08:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
want to peacefully leave imagine there's
 
08:09:46.310 --> 08:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
a woman being abused beaten viciously
 
08:09:47.590 --> 08:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
beaten and abused in every way by your
 
08:09:48.788 --> 08:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
husband and she wants to leave
 
08:09:51.750 --> 08:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
peacefully whose side would you be on
 
08:09:53.110 --> 08:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying we can't leave peacefully
 
08:09:54.150 --> 08:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
and in fact what representative the
 
08:09:55.910 --> 08:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
shades just said to people like me if we
 
08:09:57.670 --> 08:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
want to leave we're committing rebellion
 
08:09:59.270 --> 08:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
and also we'll come in with tanks the
 
08:10:00.708 --> 08:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
federal government and kill you so what
 
08:10:02.230 --> 08:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're saying is we want to leave
 
08:10:02.240 --> 08:10:03.430 align:start position:0%
they're saying is we want to leave
peacefully

08:10:03.430 --> 08:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
peacefully
 
08:10:04.788 --> 08:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
you're they're saying your trader for
 
08:10:06.070 --> 08:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
wanting to leave in fact we're going to
 
08:10:07.990 --> 08:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
use violence against you so he's saying
 
08:10:09.430 --> 08:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're saying we want to leave peacefully
 
08:10:11.430 --> 08:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the opponents of this legislation
 
08:10:13.270 --> 08:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
are saying that violence solves the it
 
08:10:15.270 --> 08:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
solves the question also they were
 
08:10:16.628 --> 08:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
saying the civil war a lot of people say
 
08:10:17.910 --> 08:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
the civil war settled this literally
 
08:10:19.750 --> 08:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
that is saying mike makes right they
 
08:10:21.030 --> 08:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
tried to leave they killed you so don't
 
08:10:23.110 --> 08:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
try again again they are the ones we are
 
08:10:24.230 --> 08:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
the peaceful ones over here you see all
 
08:10:25.270 --> 08:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
the peace signs over here we're all
 
08:10:27.190 --> 08:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
anti-war we're all pro-peace non-violent
 
08:10:27.200 --> 08:10:28.548 align:start position:0%
anti-war we're all pro-peace non-violent
voluntarists

08:10:28.548 --> 08:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
voluntarists
 
08:10:29.750 --> 08:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
they are the ones supporting violence
 
08:10:31.830 --> 08:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
they said the civil war settled this so
 
08:10:33.350 --> 08:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
again go back to your friend mary she's
 
08:10:35.110 --> 08:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
being abused by her husband she tried to
 
08:10:36.310 --> 08:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
leave once her husband caught her
 
08:10:38.628 --> 08:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
unfortunately beat her tied her up beat
 
08:10:40.868 --> 08:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
her to near death and it didn't work out
 
08:10:42.628 --> 08:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
would you tell her to never try again
 
08:10:43.990 --> 08:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
because her husband settled that issue
 
08:10:45.510 --> 08:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
because mike makes right never try to
 
08:10:47.270 --> 08:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
leave again that's ridiculous of course
 
08:10:49.270 --> 08:10:49.280 align:start position:0%

i came today not knowing where i wanted
 
08:12:41.830 --> 08:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
to stay just where i stood and i the
 
08:12:43.510 --> 08:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative aldesaro has asked us not
 
08:12:45.510 --> 08:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be repetitive so i just want to take
 
08:12:47.110 --> 08:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
a moment to
 
08:12:49.670 --> 08:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
comment on representative deshay's
 
08:12:50.868 --> 08:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
remarks earlier regarding the
 
08:12:52.868 --> 08:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
constitution he spoke a lot about the
 
08:12:55.350 --> 08:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution and his ramifications
 
08:12:57.270 --> 08:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
however i feel compelled to agree with
 
08:12:59.750 --> 08:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
and speak to what lasander spooner wrote
 
08:13:01.510 --> 08:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
in no treason constitution of no
 
08:13:03.590 --> 08:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
authority and he says
 
08:13:05.270 --> 08:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
but whether the constitution really be
 
08:13:07.350 --> 08:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
one thing or another this much is
 
08:13:07.360 --> 08:13:08.388 align:start position:0%
one thing or another this much is
certain

08:13:08.388 --> 08:13:08.398 align:start position:0%
certain
 
08:13:10.070 --> 08:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
that it has either authorized such a
 
08:13:12.230 --> 08:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
government as we have had or it has been
 
08:13:14.548 --> 08:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
powerless to prevent it in either case
 
08:13:17.190 --> 08:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
it is unfit to exist
 
08:13:18.948 --> 08:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
what we are discussing is a measure to
 
08:13:20.388 --> 08:13:20.398 align:start position:0%
allow the people of new hampshire a
 
08:13:22.150 --> 08:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
voice in whether or not they would
 
08:13:24.468 --> 08:13:24.478 align:start position:0%
reject subservience
 
08:13:26.708 --> 08:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
to a document that has failed to protect
 
08:13:28.468 --> 08:13:28.478 align:start position:0%
their rights
 
08:13:29.910 --> 08:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
he also insinuated that you could be
 
08:13:32.388 --> 08:13:32.398 align:start position:0%
considered to be in rebellion simply by
 
08:13:34.070 --> 08:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
voting in favor
 
08:13:36.388 --> 08:13:36.398 align:start position:0%
of putting this question on the ballot
 
08:13:38.548 --> 08:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
well to be frank the line between
 
08:13:41.350 --> 08:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
sedition and patriotism is fine and
 
08:13:43.990 --> 08:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
often blurry it is the duty of those
 
08:13:45.910 --> 08:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
people who call themselves patriots to
 
08:13:47.750 --> 08:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
oppose the expansion of overreach of
 
08:13:50.070 --> 08:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
tyrannical governments at every step and
 
08:13:52.070 --> 08:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
when standing up for your individual
 
08:13:54.468 --> 08:13:54.478 align:start position:0%
sovereignty crosses the line between
 
08:13:56.948 --> 08:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
patriotism and treason it's not you
 
08:13:58.868 --> 08:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
that's gone too far it's the government
 
08:14:00.310 --> 08:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
that you're opposing that has
 
08:14:01.910 --> 08:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
overstepped its bounds
 
08:14:03.430 --> 08:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
i urge you to pass this measure and
 
08:14:05.430 --> 08:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
allow the decision to be made not by
 
08:14:07.670 --> 08:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
this body but by the people of this
 
08:14:09.270 --> 08:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
state directly
 
08:14:10.150 --> 08:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
and to address the question
 
08:14:11.750 --> 08:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative branch had asked earlier
 
08:14:14.628 --> 08:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
in the day why don't we pursue a measure
 
08:14:17.270 --> 08:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
to allow people to simply have a
 
08:14:20.388 --> 08:14:20.398 align:start position:0%
referendum on the ballot we've tried and
 
08:14:23.190 --> 08:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
this body refused and state reps in this
 
08:14:23.200 --> 08:14:24.070 align:start position:0%
this body refused and state reps in this
body

08:14:24.070 --> 08:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
body
 
08:14:26.150 --> 08:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
testified against a constitutional
 
08:14:29.190 --> 08:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
amendment two years ago that would allow
 
08:14:31.350 --> 08:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire to petition a
 
08:14:33.030 --> 08:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
referendum onto the ballot and the
 
08:14:34.788 --> 08:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
arguments made were that the people were
 
08:14:37.670 --> 08:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
too stupid and uninformed to be that
 
08:14:40.070 --> 08:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
directly involved in the legislative
 
08:14:42.868 --> 08:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
process and that this body was loathe to
 
08:14:45.110 --> 08:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
seed that authority back to the people
 
08:14:46.628 --> 08:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
so it was this body in this house of
 
08:14:48.070 --> 08:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
representatives that
 
08:14:49.830 --> 08:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
kept that power from the people and
 
08:14:51.750 --> 08:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we pursue it now as a
 
08:14:53.830 --> 08:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment thank you i
 
08:14:55.510 --> 08:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
want to wrap up if anyone thank you
 
08:14:56.948 --> 08:14:56.958 align:start position:0%

and i i
 
08:15:20.308 --> 08:15:20.318 align:start position:0%
will preface it by just saying this has
 
08:15:22.628 --> 08:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
been very very interesting for me to get
 
08:15:24.628 --> 08:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
a better sense of how a lot of folks are
 
08:15:26.788 --> 08:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
looking at things uh so the wheels are
 
08:15:28.308 --> 08:15:28.318 align:start position:0%
turning in my head but i want to ask you
 
08:15:30.070 --> 08:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i and maybe somebody else can speak
 
08:15:32.070 --> 08:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
to this if new hampshire were to become
 
08:15:32.080 --> 08:15:33.430 align:start position:0%
to this if new hampshire were to become
independent

08:15:33.430 --> 08:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
independent
 
08:15:34.788 --> 08:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
08:15:37.350 --> 08:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
other countries in europe
 
08:15:40.548 --> 08:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
who would you see this new sovereign in
 
08:15:42.548 --> 08:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire aligning with or
 
08:15:44.150 --> 08:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
connecting whether
 
08:15:46.150 --> 08:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
or lying or not necessarily lying you
 
08:15:46.160 --> 08:15:47.510 align:start position:0%
or lying or not necessarily lying you
know

08:15:47.510 --> 08:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
08:15:50.548 --> 08:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
who uh who would this new
 
08:15:53.910 --> 08:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
entity connect with uh
 
08:15:55.830 --> 08:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
outside of uh
 
08:15:58.230 --> 08:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
the united states is there a
 
08:15:59.990 --> 08:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
a country that
 
08:16:01.590 --> 08:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
would have a similar
 
08:16:03.430 --> 08:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
type of uh
 
08:16:06.388 --> 08:16:06.398 align:start position:0%
uh political philosophy that that this
 
08:16:07.590 --> 08:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
new sovereign new hampshire would
 
08:16:08.708 --> 08:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
connect to i'm just i'm just wondering
 
08:16:11.910 --> 08:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
lichtenstein switzerland monaco um there
 
08:16:13.670 --> 08:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
are small nations scattered across
 
08:16:15.350 --> 08:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
europe that have governed themselves
 
08:16:17.590 --> 08:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
independently for centuries
 
08:16:21.350 --> 08:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
without a larger empire to protect them
 
08:16:22.788 --> 08:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
08:16:24.548 --> 08:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
there is no sense to an argument that
 
08:16:26.070 --> 08:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
secession or the breakup of the united
 
08:16:28.468 --> 08:16:28.478 align:start position:0%
states need be a violent breakup or
 
08:16:30.708 --> 08:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
anything other than an amicable national
 
08:16:32.708 --> 08:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
divorce should the united states break
 
08:16:33.910 --> 08:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
up and sever whether it's just new
 
08:16:35.270 --> 08:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire or new hampshire texas
 
08:16:37.430 --> 08:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
california alaska any of the other
 
08:16:39.030 --> 08:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
states considering secession is part of
 
08:16:40.788 --> 08:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
the national divorce there's nothing to
 
08:16:42.788 --> 08:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
say that a compact between those states
 
08:16:44.388 --> 08:16:44.398 align:start position:0%
and a mutual defense treaty and mutual
 
08:16:46.308 --> 08:16:46.318 align:start position:0%
trade treaties couldn't be reached in an
 
08:16:48.230 --> 08:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
amicable and peaceful manner as part of
 
08:16:50.548 --> 08:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
the discussion process and negotiation
 
08:16:52.708 --> 08:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
process afterward we saw with brexit
 
08:16:54.070 --> 08:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
that when the united kingdom wanted to
 
08:16:56.948 --> 08:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
leave the european union a union very
 
08:16:58.468 --> 08:16:58.478 align:start position:0%
similar to the united states where
 
08:17:00.308 --> 08:17:00.318 align:start position:0%
sovereign states joined in an economic
 
08:17:02.868 --> 08:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
and defense pact that those negotiations
 
08:17:04.388 --> 08:17:04.398 align:start position:0%
were approached peacefully while
 
08:17:07.030 --> 08:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
contentiously peacefully
 
08:17:08.628 --> 08:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
and the united kingdom was allowed to
 
08:17:08.638 --> 08:17:09.670 align:start position:0%
and the united kingdom was allowed to
leave

08:17:09.670 --> 08:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
leave
 
08:17:11.190 --> 08:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
and even when the united kingdom left
 
08:17:13.030 --> 08:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
one of their own provinces scotland
 
08:17:14.628 --> 08:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
decided they wanted to have their own
 
08:17:16.388 --> 08:17:16.398 align:start position:0%
referendum to leave the united kingdom
 
08:17:18.948 --> 08:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
and go back which failed but it showed
 
08:17:21.590 --> 08:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
that a peaceful process can occur and
 
08:17:23.110 --> 08:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
those processes happened through
 
08:17:26.388 --> 08:17:26.398 align:start position:0%
negotiation and talks and public
 
08:17:26.398 --> 08:17:27.990 align:start position:0%
negotiation and talks and public
involvement

08:17:27.990 --> 08:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
08:17:28.000 --> 08:17:29.030 align:start position:0%
involvement
not

08:17:29.030 --> 08:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
08:17:32.308 --> 08:17:32.318 align:start position:0%
through backdoor deals and closed roam
 
08:17:35.030 --> 08:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic processes
 
08:17:37.350 --> 08:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh follow up comment real quick uh yeah
 
08:17:38.948 --> 08:17:38.958 align:start position:0%

08:17:41.510 --> 08:17:41.520 align:start position:0%

and
 
08:17:45.510 --> 08:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
what if other entities countries put
 
08:17:48.070 --> 08:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
tariffs on our products or would we put
 
08:17:50.308 --> 08:17:50.318 align:start position:0%
tariffs i mean there's no answer tonight

one thing that hasn't really been talked
 
08:18:54.388 --> 08:18:54.398 align:start position:0%
about is uh the perspective of some of
 
08:18:56.230 --> 08:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
the history here
 
08:18:57.350 --> 08:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
so when
 
08:18:59.350 --> 08:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
when america first started
 
08:19:02.708 --> 08:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
each state was an individual country
 
08:19:06.830 --> 08:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:06.840 --> 08:19:08.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

08:19:08.708 --> 08:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:19:10.788 --> 08:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
i didn't write anything down obviously
 
08:19:13.030 --> 08:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
here um i normally don't speak
 
08:19:15.350 --> 08:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to try my best here
 
08:19:18.150 --> 08:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
take your time okay three minutes
 
08:19:20.830 --> 08:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:25.030 --> 08:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:27.190 --> 08:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess you know i i pretty much i
 
08:19:29.110 --> 08:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
decided to speak because i heard other
 
08:19:30.948 --> 08:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
people that were representatives uh they
 
08:19:33.190 --> 08:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
kept citing the 14th amendment as some
 
08:19:35.110 --> 08:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
form of authority
 
08:19:37.830 --> 08:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
now if we look at how that happened
 
08:19:39.110 --> 08:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
through history it's no form of
 
08:19:41.030 --> 08:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
authority at all
 
08:19:41.040 --> 08:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
authority at all
um

08:19:41.990 --> 08:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:19:43.670 --> 08:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
calling the united states a country is
 
08:19:45.750 --> 08:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
like calling europe a country we don't
 
08:19:48.070 --> 08:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
call europe a country we know better so
 
08:19:49.270 --> 08:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
the idea of the states is they're all
 
08:19:51.830 --> 08:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be individual nations
 
08:19:54.868 --> 08:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
and the federal government their role
 
08:19:56.468 --> 08:19:56.478 align:start position:0%
was they met like maybe a couple of
 
08:19:57.990 --> 08:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
times a year you know the farmers left
 
08:19:59.590 --> 08:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
their farms you know the businessmen
 
08:20:01.110 --> 08:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
left their businesses and they'd meet
 
08:20:02.868 --> 08:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
for a couple of times a year settle some
 
08:20:04.628 --> 08:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
stuff and go back home they weren't
 
08:20:06.230 --> 08:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
career politicians
 
08:20:07.750 --> 08:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing exactly what we're
 
08:20:09.270 --> 08:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
seeing today
 
08:20:09.280 --> 08:20:10.150 align:start position:0%
seeing today
um

08:20:10.150 --> 08:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:20:11.590 --> 08:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
and then we had what was called the
 
08:20:12.788 --> 08:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
civil war
 
08:20:14.548 --> 08:20:14.558 align:start position:0%
which i preferred to call it the war
 
08:20:16.468 --> 08:20:16.478 align:start position:0%
against the states
 
08:20:17.670 --> 08:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
and it was totally about state
 
08:20:17.680 --> 08:20:18.788 align:start position:0%
and it was totally about state
sovereignty

08:20:18.788 --> 08:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
sovereignty
 
08:20:20.388 --> 08:20:20.398 align:start position:0%
you had a federal government who wanted
 
08:20:21.590 --> 08:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
to do something that they're not
 
08:20:22.788 --> 08:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
supposed to or that they don't have
 
08:20:24.468 --> 08:20:24.478 align:start position:0%
authority to if that sounds familiar
 
08:20:24.478 --> 08:20:25.590 align:start position:0%
authority to if that sounds familiar
today

08:20:25.590 --> 08:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
08:20:27.350 --> 08:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening
 
08:20:27.360 --> 08:20:28.150 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening
and

08:20:28.150 --> 08:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:20:30.468 --> 08:20:30.478 align:start position:0%
the states had the authority
 
08:20:33.750 --> 08:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
to leave that that union because the
 
08:20:36.150 --> 08:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
federal government wasn't doing
 
08:20:37.510 --> 08:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
what they were supposed to be doing they
 
08:20:40.070 --> 08:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to do more they wanted more power
 
08:20:41.830 --> 08:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
well we know who won again somebody else
 
08:20:43.910 --> 08:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
had said might you know might wins and
 
08:20:47.030 --> 08:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
so we saw you know a big war machine win
 
08:20:48.468 --> 08:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
now the way again the federal government
 
08:20:49.590 --> 08:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
is supposed to only meet a couple of
 
08:20:51.030 --> 08:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
times a year and that's it they're not
 
08:20:53.030 --> 08:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to live in dc and like hang out
 
08:20:54.548 --> 08:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
and get paid like by a bunch of
 
08:20:54.558 --> 08:20:57.430 align:start position:0%
and get paid like by a bunch of
corporations

08:20:57.430 --> 08:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:21:00.070 --> 08:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is an abuse of power
 
08:21:02.230 --> 08:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
and this isn't the first time in history
 
08:21:05.510 --> 08:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen this obviously
 
08:21:07.190 --> 08:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm not really sure what else to say
 
08:21:09.190 --> 08:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
i guess if anybody has any questions i i
 
08:21:10.708 --> 08:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
do know a lot about this history and i
 
08:21:11.830 --> 08:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
guess i should have came with something
 
08:21:12.948 --> 08:21:12.958 align:start position:0%

08:21:14.708 --> 08:21:14.718 align:start position:0%

hampshire versus the united states it's
 
08:22:21.030 --> 08:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
about the state versus you
 
08:22:23.270 --> 08:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's about the individual versus the
 
08:22:23.280 --> 08:22:24.868 align:start position:0%
it's about the individual versus the
collective

08:22:24.868 --> 08:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
collective
 
08:22:27.670 --> 08:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government is bankrupt
 
08:22:29.350 --> 08:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
social security
 
08:22:32.308 --> 08:22:32.318 align:start position:0%
medicare they print money into existence
 
08:22:34.388 --> 08:22:34.398 align:start position:0%
out of thin air
 
08:22:36.548 --> 08:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
what good is federal funding if the
 
08:22:39.030 --> 08:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
money has no purchasing power
 
08:22:41.670 --> 08:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
in zimbabwe they printed 100 trillion
 
08:22:43.510 --> 08:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
dollar notes
 
08:22:45.590 --> 08:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
it was better to
 
08:22:47.830 --> 08:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
burn the money for its intrinsic heat
 
08:22:47.840 --> 08:22:51.030 align:start position:0%
burn the money for its intrinsic heat

08:22:52.708 --> 08:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
if people want to do further research on
 
08:22:55.628 --> 08:22:55.638 align:start position:0%
this they can go to fred
 
08:22:58.150 --> 08:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
fred.stlouisfed.org look at the m1 look
 
08:22:59.750 --> 08:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
at the m2
 
08:23:02.628 --> 08:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
look at how much money they are printing
 
08:23:05.830 --> 08:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
democrats if you really truly wanted to
 
08:23:07.830 --> 08:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
help people you would advocate for
 
08:23:09.990 --> 08:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
honest and sound money we're not getting
 
08:23:12.150 --> 08:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
that from the united states
 
08:23:14.308 --> 08:23:14.318 align:start position:0%
the chickens are coming home to roost
 
08:23:15.830 --> 08:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
you will not be able to stop the
 
08:23:18.070 --> 08:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
financial crisis which is about to beset
 
08:23:19.110 --> 08:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
the world
 
08:23:20.948 --> 08:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
the death of the dollar will be the
 
08:23:23.510 --> 08:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
second largest event in human history
 
08:23:26.708 --> 08:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
next to the birth of jesus christ
 
08:23:29.030 --> 08:23:29.040 align:start position:0%

cooked and you cannot save it
 
08:23:39.590 --> 08:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
out of this chaos a new world order will
 
08:23:41.030 --> 08:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
be formed
 
08:23:43.750 --> 08:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
your vote will decide whether we submit
 
08:23:45.990 --> 08:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
to globalist tyranny or whether we
 
08:23:48.388 --> 08:23:48.398 align:start position:0%
embrace individual sovereignty
 
08:23:51.350 --> 08:23:51.360 align:start position:0%

in your testimony today you talked about
 
08:24:09.510 --> 08:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
the collapse of the united states in a
 
08:24:10.948 --> 08:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
new world order
 
08:24:10.958 --> 08:24:11.910 align:start position:0%
new world order
uh

08:24:11.910 --> 08:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:24:15.030 --> 08:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
we increasingly see a rise in uh chinese
 
08:24:16.468 --> 08:24:16.478 align:start position:0%
and the chinese communist party and its
 
08:24:17.910 --> 08:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
influence in the world
 
08:24:20.230 --> 08:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh how do you see
 
08:24:21.990 --> 08:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
us fighting against that if we're we're
 
08:24:23.670 --> 08:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
not the united states and we're all
 
08:24:25.990 --> 08:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
divided uh the 50 states ourselves how
 
08:24:27.750 --> 08:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to stand against

china is the testing bed for the

they are perfecting their technology and
 
08:25:10.388 --> 08:25:10.398 align:start position:0%

countries all around the world and
religious

08:25:23.190 --> 08:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
religious
 
08:25:24.948 --> 08:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
is a dangerous thing in other countries
 
08:25:26.628 --> 08:25:26.638 align:start position:0%

08:25:29.590 --> 08:25:29.600 align:start position:0%

but hey welcome nobody
 
08:26:01.590 --> 08:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:26:04.308 --> 08:26:04.318 align:start position:0%
the uh i changed my name to nobody when
 
08:26:06.150 --> 08:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
i ran for governor
 
08:26:09.110 --> 08:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
i ran against john sununu and uh nobody
 
08:26:11.670 --> 08:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
knew it because he ignored me but uh my
 
08:26:14.070 --> 08:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
slogan was nobody knows how to run your
 
08:26:16.150 --> 08:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
life better than you do and nobody
 
08:26:19.910 --> 08:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:26:21.590 --> 08:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that's really
 
08:26:24.548 --> 08:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
what this comes down to today i was told
 
08:26:26.468 --> 08:26:26.478 align:start position:0%
when i was a child
 
08:26:29.830 --> 08:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
that uh we had a government by consent
 
08:26:32.070 --> 08:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
in the united states and that that was
 
08:26:36.230 --> 08:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
the basis of the justice of our system
 
08:26:39.510 --> 08:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
well nobody ever asked my consent
 
08:26:42.948 --> 08:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
my consent has been neither requested
 
08:26:46.788 --> 08:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
nor required what has been done
 
08:26:51.110 --> 08:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
is that i have had decrees imposed upon
 
08:26:51.120 --> 08:26:51.910 align:start position:0%
is that i have had decrees imposed upon
me

08:26:51.910 --> 08:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
me
 
08:26:56.150 --> 08:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
all of my life regardless of my choice
 
08:27:00.628 --> 08:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
regardless of my rights as a human being
 
08:27:04.468 --> 08:27:04.478 align:start position:0%
and regardless of my consent the united
 
08:27:07.590 --> 08:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
states government has no more interest
 
08:27:11.430 --> 08:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
in consent than a serial rapist
 
08:27:14.230 --> 08:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
the problem with the constitution is
 
08:27:18.230 --> 08:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
that it has been soaked in centuries and
 
08:27:22.708 --> 08:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
oceans of blood it has been the excuse
 
08:27:27.270 --> 08:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
for murder for torture for rape for
 
08:27:30.868 --> 08:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
doing enough doing medical experiments
 
08:27:35.270 --> 08:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
on people against their will for slavery
 
08:27:36.830 --> 08:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
for mass
 
08:27:36.840 --> 08:27:38.468 align:start position:0%
for mass
imprisonment

08:27:38.468 --> 08:27:38.478 align:start position:0%
imprisonment
 
08:27:38.478 --> 08:27:39.468 align:start position:0%
imprisonment
for

08:27:39.468 --> 08:27:39.478 align:start position:0%
for
 
08:27:44.070 --> 08:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
destruction of human beings for the sake
 
08:27:48.628 --> 08:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
of doing it and the basic problem
 
08:27:52.070 --> 08:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
is that the united states government is
 
08:27:53.830 --> 08:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
a corporation
 
08:27:57.590 --> 08:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
now what is a corporation a corporation
 
08:28:01.510 --> 08:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
is a person without a soul without a
 
08:28:04.510 --> 08:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
conscience that is able to act
 
08:28:07.990 --> 08:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
independently in in jewish mythology
 
08:28:11.030 --> 08:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
they call this a gollum and the problem
 
08:28:14.388 --> 08:28:14.398 align:start position:0%
with gollums is they always
 
08:28:17.510 --> 08:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
turn from their intended purpose
 
08:28:20.388 --> 08:28:20.398 align:start position:0%
and start doing mischief and our
 
08:28:20.398 --> 08:28:21.910 align:start position:0%
and start doing mischief and our
government

08:28:21.910 --> 08:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
08:28:24.948 --> 08:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
the government that claims to own us
 
08:28:29.750 --> 08:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
is doing a lot of mischief
 
08:28:33.990 --> 08:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:28:37.190 --> 08:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no way
 
08:28:39.190 --> 08:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
to justify
 
08:28:43.830 --> 08:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
keep forcing people to pay for wars to
 
08:28:47.510 --> 08:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
which they are morally opposed there is
 
08:28:51.350 --> 08:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing that could possibly
 
08:28:54.830 --> 08:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
justify forcing me to pay for the
 
08:28:58.548 --> 08:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
imprisonment of my fellow citizens when
 
08:29:01.190 --> 08:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
i think there is they have done nothing
 
08:29:04.230 --> 08:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
wrong there is absolutely nothing
 
08:29:08.308 --> 08:29:08.318 align:start position:0%
morally that can justify forcing me at
 
08:29:10.628 --> 08:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
gunpoint to pay
 
08:29:14.948 --> 08:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
for to fund the lab in wuhan that may
 
08:29:18.308 --> 08:29:18.318 align:start position:0%
well have developed the corona virus and
 
08:29:21.110 --> 08:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
released it either accidentally or
 
08:29:23.590 --> 08:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally with or without the
 
08:29:28.548 --> 08:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
cooperation of the sainted dr fauci
 
08:29:32.150 --> 08:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely nothing that can
 
08:29:32.160 --> 08:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely nothing that can
justify

08:29:33.750 --> 08:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
justify
 
08:29:38.548 --> 08:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
forcing me to to put a drug in my body
 
08:29:40.868 --> 08:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
that i don't want can i get you to close
 
08:29:43.190 --> 08:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
it up uh we're over almost four minutes
 
08:29:45.670 --> 08:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm getting there
 
08:29:49.750 --> 08:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
so so that is basically the problem here
 
08:29:51.270 --> 08:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
when you
 
08:29:56.150 --> 08:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
force your will on other people against
 
08:29:58.388 --> 08:29:58.398 align:start position:0%
their consent
 
08:30:01.190 --> 08:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
you are doing something wrong and
 
08:30:04.468 --> 08:30:04.478 align:start position:0%
nothing but evil will ever
 
08:30:07.190 --> 08:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
come from that and when you look at the
 
08:30:11.030 --> 08:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
rising hatred between democrats and
 
08:30:14.150 --> 08:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
republicans and it is hatred i have
 
08:30:18.070 --> 08:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
never seen this country so hateful as i
 
08:30:20.708 --> 08:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
have during the trump years and during
 
08:30:23.110 --> 08:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
the biden years and you know partially
 
08:30:24.868 --> 08:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
one of them was a malignant narcissist
 
08:30:26.628 --> 08:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
and the other one is a senile child
 
08:30:29.430 --> 08:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
molester but so i guess that has some
 
08:30:32.070 --> 08:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
understanding but the thing is when you
 
08:30:34.948 --> 08:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
seek to control people and to force your
 
08:30:37.430 --> 08:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
will on them
 
08:30:41.430 --> 08:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes you are inviting and you deserve the
 
08:30:44.708 --> 08:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
hatred and the violence that you receive
 
08:30:46.788 --> 08:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
in response i appreciate thank you for
 
08:30:48.948 --> 08:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
your testimony i appreciate it i don't
 
08:30:50.308 --> 08:30:50.318 align:start position:0%
mean to cut you off but i got other

08:30:52.000 --> 08:30:53.350 align:start position:0%
people will you anyone have any
questions

08:30:53.350 --> 08:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
08:30:55.510 --> 08:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that there's no questions uh
 
08:30:56.548 --> 08:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:30:59.430 --> 08:30:59.440 align:start position:0%

just move that from this
 
08:31:07.910 --> 08:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:09.910 --> 08:31:09.920 align:start position:0%

in three minutes please thank you and i
 
08:31:26.388 --> 08:31:26.398 align:start position:0%
should be able to keep it much shorter
 
08:31:28.628 --> 08:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
than that we appreciate it so a lot of
 
08:31:30.150 --> 08:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
people have gotten up here and talked
 
08:31:32.388 --> 08:31:32.398 align:start position:0%
about the logistics of what happens if
 
08:31:34.070 --> 08:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire succeeds
 
08:31:35.430 --> 08:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's of course
 
08:31:35.440 --> 08:31:36.308 align:start position:0%
there's of course
issues

08:31:36.308 --> 08:31:36.318 align:start position:0%
issues
 
08:31:38.150 --> 08:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
issues that have to be worked out things
 
08:31:39.350 --> 08:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
like that
 
08:31:41.750 --> 08:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
that and really i think that misses the
 
08:31:44.548 --> 08:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
heart of what this is right here right
 
08:31:46.628 --> 08:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
now we're not talking about whether
 
08:31:48.468 --> 08:31:48.478 align:start position:0%
anyone on this committee thinks that new
 
08:31:50.150 --> 08:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire should succeed i think there
 
08:31:51.510 --> 08:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
are some very
 
08:31:53.830 --> 08:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
good questions and reasons people should
 
08:31:56.788 --> 08:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
be skeptical of that what this here
 
08:31:59.270 --> 08:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
is is asking if this bill should be
 
08:32:01.830 --> 08:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
idled or put to a vote
 
08:32:04.388 --> 08:32:04.398 align:start position:0%
my representative is not here on this
 
08:32:04.398 --> 08:32:05.430 align:start position:0%
my representative is not here on this
committee

08:32:05.430 --> 08:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
08:32:08.150 --> 08:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
what i'm asking for those here who are
 
08:32:10.548 --> 08:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
considering itling this vote
 
08:32:14.150 --> 08:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
is to give me a voice a voice we're not
 
08:32:14.160 --> 08:32:15.910 align:start position:0%
is to give me a voice a voice we're not
asking

08:32:15.910 --> 08:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
asking
 
08:32:18.230 --> 08:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
for whether you think this should or
 
08:32:19.910 --> 08:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
should not happen what we're asking is
 
08:32:22.150 --> 08:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
if this gets put to the legislative body
 
08:32:24.708 --> 08:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
so that people can provide the vote
 
08:32:26.788 --> 08:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
or people can provide their input and
 
08:32:28.548 --> 08:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
work through their system and have their
 
08:32:30.708 --> 08:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
voices heard and i believe a vote to itl
 
08:32:31.910 --> 08:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
this today
 
08:32:35.750 --> 08:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
is a vote saying that people like me are
 
08:32:37.830 --> 08:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
not intelligent enough and should not
 
08:32:40.388 --> 08:32:40.398 align:start position:0%
have the right to voice our opinion
 
08:32:42.468 --> 08:32:42.478 align:start position:0%
through our reps to make this happen so
 
08:32:44.628 --> 08:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
i'm asking each of you here today to
 
08:32:47.590 --> 08:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
give me a voice let me talk to my rep
 
08:32:49.590 --> 08:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
and let this come to a vote don't kill
 
08:32:52.150 --> 08:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
this in committee and that is all okay
 
08:32:57.590 --> 08:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:57.600 --> 08:32:58.388 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

08:32:58.388 --> 08:32:58.398 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
08:33:00.788 --> 08:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh the by the way uh whether it comes
 
08:33:02.388 --> 08:33:02.398 align:start position:0%
out of your itl just your own
 
08:33:04.868 --> 08:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
information or ought to pass it goes to
 
08:33:07.590 --> 08:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
the floor and it needs two-thirds of uh
 
08:33:09.590 --> 08:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know the vote ourselves i think two
 
08:33:11.910 --> 08:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so one way or another it's going to
 
08:33:13.270 --> 08:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
go to the floor of everybody either
 
08:33:15.270 --> 08:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
going to vote
 
08:33:16.868 --> 08:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
i think it's suit
 
08:33:20.628 --> 08:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
three fair yeah it's a constitution yeah
 
08:33:22.308 --> 08:33:22.318 align:start position:0%
it's a conscious amendment yeah i read
 
08:33:22.318 --> 08:33:23.190 align:start position:0%
it's a conscious amendment yeah i read
three

08:33:23.190 --> 08:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
08:33:25.830 --> 08:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
okay the chair recognized uh
 
08:33:27.510 --> 08:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
let me see we already did will kelly
 
08:33:28.628 --> 08:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
08:33:28.638 --> 08:33:30.308 align:start position:0%
right yeah
okay

08:33:30.308 --> 08:33:30.318 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:33:30.318 --> 08:33:32.230 align:start position:0%
okay
christopher

08:33:32.230 --> 08:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
christopher
 
08:33:34.948 --> 08:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
what is that uh n
 
08:33:34.958 --> 08:33:37.990 align:start position:0%
what is that uh n
christopher

08:33:37.990 --> 08:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:33:40.628 --> 08:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
looks almost like wind uh from from
 
08:33:42.150 --> 08:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
emerald street
 
08:33:43.670 --> 08:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
in keene
 
08:33:55.430 --> 08:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:33:59.110 --> 08:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah wade oh okay yes all right

hi welcome
hi

08:34:02.308 --> 08:34:02.318 align:start position:0%
hi
 
08:34:04.468 --> 08:34:04.478 align:start position:0%
three minutes thank you okay i'm
 
08:34:05.750 --> 08:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
christopher wade from keene new
 
08:34:07.990 --> 08:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire i want to
 
08:34:09.270 --> 08:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of i want to talk about
 
08:34:10.868 --> 08:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
but i'll try and keep it short the new
 
08:34:13.430 --> 08:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire advantage died um the supreme
 
08:34:15.110 --> 08:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
court recently ruled a couple years ago
 
08:34:17.510 --> 08:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
now uh that basically you have to
 
08:34:19.830 --> 08:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
collect tax for 10 000 different jury or
 
08:34:21.190 --> 08:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
more than 10 000 different taxing
 
08:34:22.948 --> 08:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the united states it
 
08:34:24.230 --> 08:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter that you're in new
 
08:34:26.070 --> 08:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh and new hampshire doesn't
 
08:34:27.990 --> 08:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
have a sales tax
 
08:34:30.788 --> 08:34:30.798 align:start position:0%
there's a 25 tariff on goods coming into
 
08:34:31.990 --> 08:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
the united states which basically
 
08:34:33.990 --> 08:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
reduces your effective income by about
 
08:34:36.628 --> 08:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
13 percent
 
08:34:37.830 --> 08:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of problems and these are
 
08:34:39.830 --> 08:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
just some examples of
 
08:34:43.190 --> 08:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
what uh what we can't solve without
 
08:34:43.200 --> 08:34:44.548 align:start position:0%
what uh what we can't solve without
independence

08:34:44.548 --> 08:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
independence
 
08:34:46.868 --> 08:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
new samples new hampshire's population
 
08:34:48.868 --> 08:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
would be wealthier if independent and
 
08:34:50.388 --> 08:34:50.398 align:start position:0%
one of the wealthiest countries in the
 
08:34:50.398 --> 08:34:51.670 align:start position:0%
one of the wealthiest countries in the
world

08:34:51.670 --> 08:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
world
 
08:34:53.830 --> 08:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
71 to 78 of the population in new
 
08:34:55.350 --> 08:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire supports independence
 
08:34:57.590 --> 08:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
according to a union leader poll that's
 
08:35:00.708 --> 08:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
three times three four times more than
 
08:35:03.030 --> 08:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
any other uh independence movie in the
 
08:35:05.990 --> 08:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
united states that's i believe uh even
 
08:35:09.030 --> 08:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
more or basically around what
 
08:35:09.040 --> 08:35:10.070 align:start position:0%
more or basically around what
canada

08:35:10.070 --> 08:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
canada
 
08:35:10.080 --> 08:35:11.590 align:start position:0%
canada
um

08:35:11.590 --> 08:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:35:11.600 --> 08:35:12.788 align:start position:0%
um
independence

08:35:12.788 --> 08:35:12.798 align:start position:0%
independence
 
08:35:14.708 --> 08:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
in quebec i believe was
 
08:35:17.430 --> 08:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
so there's actually a good chance that
 
08:35:21.190 --> 08:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
this could pass if those numbers are
 
08:35:22.788 --> 08:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
accurate and obviously it's not a
 
08:35:24.388 --> 08:35:24.398 align:start position:0%
scientific poll so it is hard to tell
 
08:35:25.670 --> 08:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm also comparing against
 
08:35:28.468 --> 08:35:28.478 align:start position:0%
unscientific polls so if new hampshire's
 
08:35:29.750 --> 08:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional authorized joining the
 
08:35:31.270 --> 08:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
united states it must be the case that
 
08:35:32.868 --> 08:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
it can authorize leaving the united
 
08:35:32.878 --> 08:35:33.910 align:start position:0%
it can authorize leaving the united
states

08:35:33.910 --> 08:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
states
 
08:35:35.350 --> 08:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
this is the peaceful solution in
 
08:35:37.430 --> 08:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
independence not the violent version and
 
08:35:38.948 --> 08:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you to vote for this
 
08:35:40.788 --> 08:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
amendment else we risk things getting
 
08:35:43.110 --> 08:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
out of control you can only repress the
 
08:35:44.788 --> 08:35:44.798 align:start position:0%
population for so long
 
08:35:47.190 --> 08:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
if independence is impossible that is
 
08:35:49.030 --> 08:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
all the more reason to declare it that
 
08:35:50.868 --> 08:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
sends the message to dc that we will not
 
08:35:53.670 --> 08:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
sit idly by and do nothing if the dc
 
08:35:57.590 --> 08:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
invades we will gain economic prosperity
 
08:35:58.628 --> 08:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happened in
 
08:35:58.638 --> 08:35:59.830 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happened in
afghanistan

08:35:59.830 --> 08:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
afghanistan
 
08:36:02.308 --> 08:36:02.318 align:start position:0%
explicitly because
 
08:36:05.830 --> 08:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
explicitly because this is not a war and
 
08:36:07.670 --> 08:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
troops on our streets would help us
 
08:36:07.680 --> 08:36:09.190 align:start position:0%
troops on our streets would help us
economically

08:36:09.190 --> 08:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
economically
 
08:36:11.350 --> 08:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
they would contribute to our economy
 
08:36:13.510 --> 08:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
nobody has proposed a war
 
08:36:15.750 --> 08:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
nobody is suggesting war what we're
 
08:36:17.110 --> 08:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that we declare
 
08:36:17.120 --> 08:36:19.190 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that we declare
independence

08:36:19.190 --> 08:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
independence
 
08:36:21.110 --> 08:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
08:36:22.868 --> 08:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
the united states will leave they will
 
08:36:24.708 --> 08:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
take their troops and go home just like
 
08:36:26.788 --> 08:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
they did in afghanistan it might take 20
 
08:36:28.788 --> 08:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
years but it can happen
 
08:36:30.150 --> 08:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
an independent new hampshire does not
 
08:36:31.350 --> 08:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
mean anyone will lose their u.s
 
08:36:33.270 --> 08:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
citizenship as this is
 
08:36:35.670 --> 08:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
the way of uh this is done through birth
 
08:36:38.628 --> 08:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
okay you are born a u.s citizen well i
 
08:36:40.548 --> 08:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
mean generally speaking most of us
 
08:36:42.788 --> 08:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
anyway um and you wouldn't lose it just
 
08:36:44.548 --> 08:36:44.558 align:start position:0%
because you are now also a new hampshire
 
08:36:47.270 --> 08:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
citizenship now people born
 
08:36:48.788 --> 08:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
after independence would only have new
 
08:36:50.628 --> 08:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizenship but
 
08:36:52.150 --> 08:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
again that's that's not really too much
 
08:36:53.510 --> 08:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
of a problem
 
08:36:55.270 --> 08:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
nobody would lose their social security
 
08:36:57.430 --> 08:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
because it's not where you live that
 
08:36:59.110 --> 08:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
determines that it's based on having
 
08:37:00.948 --> 08:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
paid into the system and i know many
 
08:37:03.030 --> 08:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
people who live in different countries
 
08:37:05.750 --> 08:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
who largely or i'm sorry legally collect
 
08:37:07.750 --> 08:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
on their social security
 
08:37:09.430 --> 08:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment does not solve every
 
08:37:11.510 --> 08:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
issue this is just to ask reps to let
 
08:37:14.150 --> 08:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
the citizenry vote on independence and
 
08:37:16.070 --> 08:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
the details are left to the courts and
 
08:37:18.468 --> 08:37:18.478 align:start position:0%
legislators to decide through law to
 
08:37:20.308 --> 08:37:20.318 align:start position:0%
resolve any conflicts that remain
 
08:37:21.750 --> 08:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
certainly there would there will be
 
08:37:21.760 --> 08:37:23.830 align:start position:0%
certainly there would there will be
issues

08:37:23.830 --> 08:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
issues
 
08:37:27.110 --> 08:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
independence is messy
 
08:37:28.788 --> 08:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
those who support i'm almost done the
 
08:37:30.948 --> 08:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
support those who support independence
 
08:37:32.628 --> 08:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
are still supporting democracy we
 
08:37:34.628 --> 08:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be here right now those who are
 
08:37:37.110 --> 08:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
violent aren't here but they exist
 
08:37:39.270 --> 08:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
already and peaceful people can also
 
08:37:40.948 --> 08:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
become violent if things continue down
 
08:37:42.948 --> 08:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
this terrible path and we have been
 
08:37:45.350 --> 08:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
heading that way i ask you not to create
 
08:37:46.868 --> 08:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
a situation that would move peaceful
 
08:37:50.708 --> 08:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
people to violent revolution
 
08:37:53.430 --> 08:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
the us is the u.s waging war against new
 
08:37:55.270 --> 08:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire would result in significant
 
08:37:57.430 --> 08:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
economic harm to the u.s just as it
 
08:37:59.750 --> 08:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
would harm harm new hampshire
 
08:38:01.830 --> 08:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is not afghanistan but even those
 
08:38:03.990 --> 08:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
with few arms are successful at winning
 
08:38:06.230 --> 08:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
a war against the united states many
 
08:38:08.628 --> 08:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
countries have divided without war
 
08:38:10.548 --> 08:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
we can do the same in new hampshire
 
08:38:12.070 --> 08:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
08:38:13.990 --> 08:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
one thing that you said about social
 
08:38:17.030 --> 08:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
security won't lose um so you're saying
 
08:38:18.230 --> 08:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
there that
 
08:38:21.510 --> 08:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
we'll keep our ties if we uh this passes
 
08:38:24.388 --> 08:38:24.398 align:start position:0%
keep our ties with the u.s and do social
 
08:38:26.468 --> 08:38:26.478 align:start position:0%
security social security doesn't go away
 
08:38:29.270 --> 08:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
because it's not based on uh where you
 
08:38:31.830 --> 08:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
live so if you paid into it let me let
 
08:38:34.308 --> 08:38:34.318 align:start position:0%
me rephrase that question
 
08:38:36.868 --> 08:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
will people be required to still pay
 
08:38:40.788 --> 08:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
into social security now so okay
 
08:38:42.150 --> 08:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
what happened to it that you would do
 
08:38:44.468 --> 08:38:44.478 align:start position:0%
and answer me real quick if you can
 
08:38:45.990 --> 08:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
what would happen to all them people
 
08:38:47.750 --> 08:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
that are 55
 
08:38:51.750 --> 08:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
50 40 60 that aren't 65 yet or whatever
 
08:38:53.830 --> 08:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
that paid into the system what happens
 
08:38:55.430 --> 08:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
today i would still get it up until the
 
08:38:57.430 --> 08:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
point in which they stopped paying it
 
08:38:59.510 --> 08:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
they will get it yeah that's how that
 
08:38:59.520 --> 08:39:00.628 align:start position:0%
they will get it yeah that's how that
works

08:39:00.628 --> 08:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
works
 
08:39:00.638 --> 08:39:01.670 align:start position:0%
works

economic ties to the united states the
 
08:39:08.628 --> 08:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
united states would would be crazy it's
 
08:39:10.070 --> 08:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
this isn't afghanistan that they're
 
08:39:11.430 --> 08:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
invading it's they're actually hurting
 
08:39:13.830 --> 08:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
themselves because we're so closely tied
 
08:39:15.990 --> 08:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
economically to boston to the united
 
08:39:18.468 --> 08:39:18.478 align:start position:0%

um i grew up this country like everybody
 
08:39:55.910 --> 08:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
else just thinking well most people
 
08:39:58.230 --> 08:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
thinking you know america is a really
 
08:39:59.670 --> 08:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know a place where we do things
 
08:40:01.750 --> 08:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
different we embrace democracy and i
 
08:40:03.830 --> 08:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
think everybody republican or democrat
 
08:40:06.628 --> 08:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
can say we really you know we believe in
 
08:40:09.190 --> 08:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
democracy what that form of democracy is
 
08:40:09.200 --> 08:40:10.468 align:start position:0%
democracy what that form of democracy is
varies

08:40:10.468 --> 08:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
varies
 
08:40:12.868 --> 08:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
um you know you do the right things
 
08:40:14.468 --> 08:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
everything's going to work out we're the
 
08:40:16.070 --> 08:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
greatest country in the world in all
 
08:40:17.910 --> 08:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
those things over the course of my
 
08:40:19.750 --> 08:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
adulthood and especially in the last
 
08:40:20.948 --> 08:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
eight years
 
08:40:24.308 --> 08:40:24.318 align:start position:0%
you kind of lose some of that luster on
 
08:40:25.750 --> 08:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
those things
 
08:40:25.760 --> 08:40:26.948 align:start position:0%
those things
and

08:40:26.948 --> 08:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:40:29.270 --> 08:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
being in new hampshire i've seen that
 
08:40:32.230 --> 08:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
things can really work at this level and
 
08:40:32.240 --> 08:40:33.030 align:start position:0%
things can really work at this level and
are

08:40:33.030 --> 08:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
08:40:35.350 --> 08:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
are doing well and it's kind of restored
 
08:40:37.270 --> 08:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
my faith in systems
 
08:40:39.190 --> 08:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
um but
 
08:40:41.350 --> 08:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
just thinking about it it's
 
08:40:43.030 --> 08:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't get a chance to use our
 
08:40:45.190 --> 08:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
voice if we can't even
 
08:40:46.708 --> 08:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
speak and say
 
08:40:48.868 --> 08:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
through a vote on a ballot
 
08:40:50.548 --> 08:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
that we
 
08:40:52.868 --> 08:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
don't agree with what's going on in dc
 
08:40:55.030 --> 08:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we want something else i mean in the
 
08:40:57.350 --> 08:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
end of the day that's all we're asking
 
08:40:58.868 --> 08:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
for here i mean
 
08:41:00.948 --> 08:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to bore you with you know
 
08:41:02.628 --> 08:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
definitions of why we should
 
08:41:05.270 --> 08:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislatively do this or not do this i
 
08:41:07.430 --> 08:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
just want a voice i just want a chance i
 
08:41:09.910 --> 08:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
just want to be able to say
 
08:41:11.910 --> 08:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
like i've been taught all along why
 
08:41:14.308 --> 08:41:14.318 align:start position:0%
america is so great i should be able to
 
08:41:16.788 --> 08:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
say things by doing the right things and
 
08:41:18.628 --> 08:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
and going through and getting this done
 
08:41:20.388 --> 08:41:20.398 align:start position:0%

08:43:11.510 --> 08:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
who are angry and upset about the
 
08:43:14.230 --> 08:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
situation that we are in inflation all
 
08:43:16.468 --> 08:43:16.478 align:start position:0%
of these things the wars i think we
 
08:43:18.468 --> 08:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
agree on those situations
 
08:43:20.788 --> 08:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
so why wouldn't we be here today
 
08:43:23.270 --> 08:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
condemning those wars trying to pass
 
08:43:26.230 --> 08:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to effect change uh in terms
 
08:43:28.468 --> 08:43:28.478 align:start position:0%
of how we could reduce inflation or
 
08:43:29.830 --> 08:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
something like that why wouldn't we
 
08:43:31.750 --> 08:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
focus on the issues that are making
 
08:43:33.990 --> 08:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
people angry and not try to create a
 
08:43:36.070 --> 08:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
whole other divisive issue
 
08:43:36.080 --> 08:43:36.868 align:start position:0%
whole other divisive issue
like

08:43:36.868 --> 08:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
like
 
08:43:38.628 --> 08:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
seceding from the union
 
08:43:41.030 --> 08:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it just seems like a waste of time
 
08:43:43.430 --> 08:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
to me when there are serious issues that
 
08:43:45.350 --> 08:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
could be addressed not by the federal
 
08:43:47.190 --> 08:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
government but right here in the state
 
08:43:49.590 --> 08:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
legislature we could be focusing on
 
08:43:51.510 --> 08:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
those issues condemning the federal
 
08:43:53.270 --> 08:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
government for what it needs to be there
 
08:43:54.628 --> 08:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
are things that we can do we have the
 
08:43:55.990 --> 08:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
power here in the state house we have
 
08:43:58.468 --> 08:43:58.478 align:start position:0%
the power as people um i agree the
 
08:44:00.548 --> 08:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
federal government is is quite
 
08:44:02.868 --> 08:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
tyrannical it's it's leaning towards
 
08:44:05.350 --> 08:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
dictatorship that is a scary thing that
 
08:44:07.430 --> 08:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
is a terribly scary thing
 
08:44:09.190 --> 08:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to leave the united
 
08:44:11.350 --> 08:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
states of america just because
 
08:44:12.868 --> 08:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
some people who are at the head of the
 
08:44:15.190 --> 08:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
united states of america are twisting
 
08:44:16.948 --> 08:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
and manipulating what the message of
 
08:44:18.388 --> 08:44:18.398 align:start position:0%
that country is
 
08:44:20.070 --> 08:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
we've lost our country this is not our
 
08:44:23.030 --> 08:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
country we've lost it but we can bring
 
08:44:23.910 --> 08:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
it back
 
08:44:25.830 --> 08:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
seceding is not how we bring it back
 
08:44:27.670 --> 08:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
fighting for it is how we bring it back
 
08:44:27.680 --> 08:44:28.788 align:start position:0%
fighting for it is how we bring it back
honoring

08:44:28.788 --> 08:44:28.798 align:start position:0%

stater small business owner
 
08:45:53.990 --> 08:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
i moved here five years ago i've lived
 
08:45:55.910 --> 08:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
in other countries i've traveled the
 
08:45:57.910 --> 08:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
world and i agree with these statements
 
08:46:09.030 --> 08:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:46:10.830 --> 08:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
let's turn red right
 
08:46:11.830 --> 08:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
is all right
 
08:46:13.990 --> 08:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
so um i recently went back to california
 
08:46:16.388 --> 08:46:16.398 align:start position:0%
for the first time in three years and um
 
08:46:17.990 --> 08:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know one of the reasons why i moved
 
08:46:18.000 --> 08:46:18.868 align:start position:0%
you know one of the reasons why i moved
here

08:46:18.868 --> 08:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
08:46:21.910 --> 08:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
was because i i i see the decline there
 
08:46:21.920 --> 08:46:22.788 align:start position:0%
was because i i i see the decline there
it's

08:46:22.788 --> 08:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's
 
08:46:25.190 --> 08:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's almost uh
 
08:46:27.190 --> 08:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
i mean it's just sad it's sad to see so
 
08:46:29.510 --> 08:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
i i found myself on the beach feet in
 
08:46:30.868 --> 08:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
the sand
 
08:46:32.788 --> 08:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
watching a bunch of people
 
08:46:36.230 --> 08:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
walk by in their mask on the beach um
 
08:46:38.548 --> 08:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
and watching
 
08:46:39.990 --> 08:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
all these mandates i mean i went to a
 
08:46:41.190 --> 08:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
park and it said that you had to wear a
 
08:46:42.628 --> 08:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
mask in the park
 
08:46:42.638 --> 08:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
mask in the park
it

08:46:43.590 --> 08:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:46:46.708 --> 08:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's insane what's happening around
 
08:46:48.230 --> 08:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
the us today
 
08:46:49.910 --> 08:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we'd be delusional if we ignored it
 
08:46:51.190 --> 08:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
and said this is happening in some
 
08:46:53.510 --> 08:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
vacuum or you know that's not going on
 
08:46:55.110 --> 08:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
we have to recognize the the greater
 
08:46:56.948 --> 08:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
situation there so when i heard about
 
08:46:59.190 --> 08:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
this bill coming up i kind of i wasn't
 
08:47:01.590 --> 08:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
sure whether uh
 
08:47:03.270 --> 08:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
whether the time was right until i just
 
08:47:05.110 --> 08:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
got back from a trip in san diego to san
 
08:47:07.430 --> 08:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
diego because
 
08:47:09.350 --> 08:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's not good what what what's
 
08:47:11.430 --> 08:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
going on in the u.s and all the other
 
08:47:11.440 --> 08:47:12.548 align:start position:0%
going on in the u.s and all the other
reasons

08:47:12.548 --> 08:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
08:47:13.430 --> 08:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
08:47:14.948 --> 08:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
is that everyone in the us is very
 
08:47:17.190 --> 08:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
delusional about the wars about what's
 
08:47:19.830 --> 08:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
happening in dc they it's easy with our
 
08:47:23.110 --> 08:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
prosperity to ignore all of it and just
 
08:47:24.628 --> 08:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
say oh we'll get by on the fact that
 
08:47:26.548 --> 08:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
we're doing so well economically
 
08:47:28.788 --> 08:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
but that's going to come back
 
08:47:32.468 --> 08:47:32.478 align:start position:0%
so when i saw this law this cacr come up
 
08:47:34.230 --> 08:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
um i i started walking through myself
 
08:47:36.308 --> 08:47:36.318 align:start position:0%
through the process of of what it would
 
08:47:36.318 --> 08:47:37.110 align:start position:0%
through the process of of what it would
mean

08:47:37.110 --> 08:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
mean
 
08:47:37.120 --> 08:47:38.308 align:start position:0%
mean
and

08:47:38.308 --> 08:47:38.318 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:47:40.388 --> 08:47:40.398 align:start position:0%
ultimately this this is just a question
 
08:47:41.990 --> 08:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
can we can the people answer it that's
 
08:47:44.150 --> 08:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
all we're talking about
 
08:47:46.468 --> 08:47:46.478 align:start position:0%
and this is the democratic process this
 
08:47:48.830 --> 08:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
is the process this is the peaceful
 
08:47:51.750 --> 08:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
process is is getting people to to
 
08:47:53.350 --> 08:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
answer that question because i've been
 
08:47:54.708 --> 08:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
following this kind of stuff around the
 
08:47:56.548 --> 08:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
world for a long time this usually ends
 
08:47:59.190 --> 08:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
in violence uh and the way it happened
 
08:48:01.030 --> 08:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
in the us they said we're gonna be
 
08:48:02.788 --> 08:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
independent and the king said no i'm
 
08:48:05.350 --> 08:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
gonna come send soldiers there right it
 
08:48:06.868 --> 08:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
goes violent
 
08:48:08.308 --> 08:48:08.318 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't go peaceful right so we're
 
08:48:10.150 --> 08:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
trying to we everyone wants us to go
 
08:48:11.990 --> 08:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
peaceful everyone does but it's
 
08:48:13.990 --> 08:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
untenable it's already violent they're
 
08:48:15.590 --> 08:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
already attacking us
 
08:48:18.388 --> 08:48:18.398 align:start position:0%
it's already that bad and
 
08:48:19.990 --> 08:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
they don't they're not our friends
 
08:48:21.750 --> 08:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
people in california don't
 
08:48:23.510 --> 08:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't give a crap about
 
08:48:25.430 --> 08:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
you and new hampshire
 
08:48:27.030 --> 08:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
and that's my impression you know not
 
08:48:29.110 --> 08:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
just california everywhere everywhere
 
08:48:31.030 --> 08:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
i've been they care about themselves
 
08:48:32.788 --> 08:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
they think their state's number one they
 
08:48:34.388 --> 08:48:34.398 align:start position:0%
would love to exert all their control
 
08:48:35.430 --> 08:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
over you
 
08:48:37.110 --> 08:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i think it's an abusive relationship
 
08:48:38.468 --> 08:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
that we need to get out of
 
08:48:40.230 --> 08:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
while we can why we can do it peacefully
 
08:48:42.230 --> 08:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't think this will even if it
 
08:48:43.910 --> 08:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
went to the people i i you know i think
 
08:48:45.270 --> 08:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's a big thing whether it would
 
08:48:47.350 --> 08:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
actually pass there but we got out we
 
08:48:48.868 --> 08:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
got to let the question be asked because
 
08:48:50.468 --> 08:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
if we don't we're shutting down the
 
08:48:52.868 --> 08:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
peaceful option and that's not we can't
 
08:48:53.830 --> 08:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
do that
 
08:48:55.110 --> 08:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
because then that's that's already
 
08:48:57.270 --> 08:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
saying that that
 
08:48:59.270 --> 08:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's giving into the violence
 
08:49:04.150 --> 08:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:49:08.308 --> 08:49:08.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:49:09.590 --> 08:49:09.600 align:start position:0%

they
 
08:50:53.670 --> 08:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
why would you
 
08:50:55.270 --> 08:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
keep on
 
08:50:57.430 --> 08:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with somebody that plays mind
 
08:50:58.628 --> 08:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
games with you
 
08:51:03.110 --> 08:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:03.120 --> 08:51:04.628 align:start position:0%
 
like

08:51:04.628 --> 08:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
like
 
08:51:08.548 --> 08:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:10.948 --> 08:51:10.958 align:start position:0%

had a friend commit suicide because of
that

08:51:22.708 --> 08:51:22.718 align:start position:0%

08:51:25.190 --> 08:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
and then look at look at the suicide
 
08:51:28.788 --> 08:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:28.798 --> 08:51:29.590 align:start position:0%

like
it's

08:51:32.830 --> 08:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:37.270 --> 08:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
untenable that i i don't see a point in
 
08:51:39.110 --> 08:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with people that don't care
 
08:51:40.468 --> 08:51:40.478 align:start position:0%
about you
 
08:51:40.478 --> 08:51:42.150 align:start position:0%

08:51:44.628 --> 08:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
seek your consent for
 
08:51:47.030 --> 08:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
these edicts
 
08:51:52.150 --> 08:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:56.230 --> 08:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:57.670 --> 08:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
why are we still in this abusive
 
08:51:57.680 --> 08:51:59.910 align:start position:0%
why are we still in this abusive
relationship

08:51:59.910 --> 08:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
08:52:01.430 --> 08:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's the question i would like to pose
 
08:52:04.388 --> 08:52:04.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:52:04.398 --> 08:52:06.628 align:start position:0%
 
and

08:52:06.628 --> 08:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:52:11.750 --> 08:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:52:13.750 --> 08:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i mean you know there's a
 
08:52:15.350 --> 08:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
good question why are we in an abusive
 
08:52:15.360 --> 08:52:16.468 align:start position:0%
good question why are we in an abusive
relationship

08:52:16.468 --> 08:52:16.478 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
08:52:20.548 --> 08:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
but you know the question i have is um
 
08:52:22.708 --> 08:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
this abusive relationship has thrown so
 
08:52:25.990 --> 08:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
many carrots to the state it bought not
 
08:52:27.190 --> 08:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
probably about
 
08:52:29.910 --> 08:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
90 percent of our military is paid
 
08:52:31.750 --> 08:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
through the federal government
 
08:52:33.510 --> 08:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
our equipment everything that we have
 
08:52:35.110 --> 08:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
here in the state
 
08:52:36.628 --> 08:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
i wonder what happens all that our
 
08:52:38.548 --> 08:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
airplanes are it's all owned by the
 
08:52:39.830 --> 08:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
08:52:41.910 --> 08:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
and how we would protect the sovereignty
 
08:52:41.920 --> 08:52:42.868 align:start position:0%
and how we would protect the sovereignty
of

08:52:42.868 --> 08:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
08:52:44.868 --> 08:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire real quick in 30 seconds
 
08:52:46.788 --> 08:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
could you answer that the sovereignty of
 
08:52:49.110 --> 08:52:49.120 align:start position:0%

08:52:50.548 --> 08:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
buy our own
 
08:52:53.430 --> 08:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
what pistol about so you're saying maybe
 
08:52:55.430 --> 08:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
raise taxes on everybody and just not
 
08:52:59.030 --> 08:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:53:01.750 --> 08:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
you can ask the citizenry for donations
 
08:53:01.760 --> 08:53:02.948 align:start position:0%
you can ask the citizenry for donations
for

08:53:02.948 --> 08:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
08:53:02.958 --> 08:53:03.670 align:start position:0%
for
like

08:53:03.670 --> 08:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
08:53:06.708 --> 08:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
you don't have you can
 
08:53:09.590 --> 08:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
look at um back when
 
08:53:11.270 --> 08:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
we had uh
 
08:53:12.788 --> 08:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
was it
 
08:53:14.788 --> 08:53:14.798 align:start position:0%

commander-in-chief that he has the
 
08:54:39.990 --> 08:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
authority to call on
 
08:54:42.388 --> 08:54:42.398 align:start position:0%
the militias to uh in the seven colonies
 
08:54:44.548 --> 08:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
or the nine colonies or whatever it was
 
08:54:46.388 --> 08:54:46.398 align:start position:0%
the seven i think it was that's why i
 
08:54:48.830 --> 08:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
carry the constitution because i'm not
 
08:54:50.230 --> 08:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
perfect back in and pull it out just
 
08:54:51.750 --> 08:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
like the rest of us right so i'm saying
 
08:54:53.030 --> 08:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
is that it's already in that
 
08:54:55.270 --> 08:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
constitution u.s constitution about the
 
08:54:57.750 --> 08:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
militia so our militia could be pulled
 
08:54:59.270 --> 08:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
08:55:01.670 --> 08:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
for that united states not if we cut the
 
08:55:05.910 --> 08:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
court we have no okay all right no
 
08:55:07.430 --> 08:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
i just want to let you know what it says
 
08:55:09.750 --> 08:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the u.s constitution under section 2
 
08:55:11.830 --> 08:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
commander-in-chief's responsibility you
 
08:55:13.430 --> 08:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
08:55:13.440 --> 08:55:14.388 align:start position:0%
had a question
yes

08:55:14.388 --> 08:55:14.398 align:start position:0%
yes
 
08:55:17.830 --> 08:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:55:20.548 --> 08:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
are you aware that i believe that in the
 
08:55:22.308 --> 08:55:22.318 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state constitution that
 
08:55:22.318 --> 08:55:23.110 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state constitution that
the

08:55:23.110 --> 08:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:55:25.510 --> 08:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
militia is
 
08:55:26.708 --> 08:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
at the
 
08:55:28.788 --> 08:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
behest of the governor
 
08:55:31.430 --> 08:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
so even if we were to secede from the
 
08:55:34.788 --> 08:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
union successfully and have and and
 
08:55:38.230 --> 08:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
have our own sovereign state
 
08:55:40.868 --> 08:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
that our governor actually
 
08:55:44.070 --> 08:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to if we were to to follow
 
08:55:47.110 --> 08:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
this constitution and this constitution
 
08:55:49.190 --> 08:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
would still be at the behest of the of
 
08:55:50.948 --> 08:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
the the governor
 
08:55:52.468 --> 08:55:52.478 align:start position:0%
yes but we have a more direct line of
 
08:55:54.708 --> 08:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
communication with our governor and we
 
08:55:56.868 --> 08:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
do have a more direct you're correct and
 
08:55:59.830 --> 08:55:59.840 align:start position:0%

49 other states and territories for the

thank you for having me i'll try to be
 
08:56:36.070 --> 08:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
as quick as i can
 
08:56:38.230 --> 08:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
i want to uh take the opportunity to be
 
08:56:38.240 --> 08:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
i want to uh take the opportunity to be
the

08:56:39.030 --> 08:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:56:42.548 --> 08:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
needless parent everyone uh not everyone
 
08:56:44.948 --> 08:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
i suppose but i often get the reputation
 
08:56:47.270 --> 08:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
of having which is to directly
 
08:56:47.280 --> 08:56:48.230 align:start position:0%
of having which is to directly
uh

08:56:48.230 --> 08:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
08:56:51.430 --> 08:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
try to ask why we're here for cacr32
 
08:56:54.230 --> 08:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
which is about adding the option for
 
08:56:56.468 --> 08:56:56.478 align:start position:0%
voting for the citizenry of new
 
08:57:00.388 --> 08:57:00.398 align:start position:0%
hampshire to secede from the the union
 
08:57:02.628 --> 08:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
and it's up to you fine folks to decide
 
08:57:04.070 --> 08:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether that
 
08:57:05.910 --> 08:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
that option even ends up on the ballot
 
08:57:07.190 --> 08:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
in november
 
08:57:11.110 --> 08:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
if am i correct in that yes okay
 
08:57:13.350 --> 08:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
so given that uh
 
08:57:15.190 --> 08:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of reasons for seceding
 
08:57:16.788 --> 08:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of reasons for not
 
08:57:18.468 --> 08:57:18.478 align:start position:0%
succeeding and all these abuses and all
 
08:57:20.388 --> 08:57:20.398 align:start position:0%
the information that we can bring out
 
08:57:20.398 --> 08:57:21.510 align:start position:0%
the information that we can bring out
is

08:57:21.510 --> 08:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:57:23.110 --> 08:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i think not material for
 
08:57:25.190 --> 08:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here today we're
 
08:57:27.590 --> 08:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
trying to convince you guys to let
 
08:57:29.830 --> 08:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire residents
 
08:57:31.910 --> 08:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
have our own voice in that position and
 
08:57:34.150 --> 08:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
we we get to then come forward and
 
08:57:35.670 --> 08:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
debate with each other and the rest of
 
08:57:36.948 --> 08:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
the world and the rest of the union to
 
08:57:38.948 --> 08:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
figure out where we're going to end up
 
08:57:40.708 --> 08:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
at the end of all of that
 
08:57:44.708 --> 08:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
so i want to appeal to this council
 
08:57:46.548 --> 08:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
to ask you why we
 
08:57:48.548 --> 08:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
why you might vote against this
 
08:57:50.388 --> 08:57:50.398 align:start position:0%
if now is not the time
 
08:57:52.468 --> 08:57:52.478 align:start position:0%
then win is if the timing is bad then
 
08:57:54.150 --> 08:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
why is california moving forward with
 
08:57:55.510 --> 08:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
their own
 
08:57:58.150 --> 08:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm sorry no we're just trying
 
08:58:00.388 --> 08:58:00.398 align:start position:0%
to organize so we get uh cards oh yeah
 
08:58:00.398 --> 08:58:02.308 align:start position:0%
to organize so we get uh cards oh yeah
okay

08:58:02.308 --> 08:58:02.318 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:58:06.708 --> 08:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
go ahead we apologize go ahead yeah um
 
08:58:09.830 --> 08:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if not now then then when
 
08:58:11.830 --> 08:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
if not us the people of new hampshire
 
08:58:13.590 --> 08:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
making this decision
 
08:58:14.868 --> 08:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
then who
 
08:58:16.708 --> 08:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
exactly what should be our goals in
 
08:58:19.110 --> 08:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
trying to add this or not add this to
 
08:58:21.830 --> 08:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
the ballot uh i believe there is no
 
08:58:23.910 --> 08:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
better time because honestly i'll have
 
08:58:25.350 --> 08:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
to ask you guys how many times you want
 
08:58:27.590 --> 08:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
to do this because just because
 
08:58:30.628 --> 08:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
we shut down cacr 32 this year for this
 
08:58:30.638 --> 08:58:32.150 align:start position:0%
we shut down cacr 32 this year for this
ballot

08:58:32.150 --> 08:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
08:58:33.830 --> 08:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
almost guaranteed we're going to be back
 
08:58:35.670 --> 08:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to try again because we
 
08:58:36.868 --> 08:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
really really doubt that things are
 
08:58:38.308 --> 08:58:38.318 align:start position:0%
going to get that much better in two
 
08:58:41.030 --> 08:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
years so give us the opportunity to to
 
08:58:43.110 --> 08:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
voice our opinions as soon as possible
 
08:58:44.868 --> 08:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
and we can work towards
 
08:58:45.990 --> 08:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
how that's going to work out in the
 
08:58:48.468 --> 08:58:48.478 align:start position:0%
future putting this measure onto the
 
08:58:48.478 --> 08:58:50.150 align:start position:0%
future putting this measure onto the
ballot

08:58:50.150 --> 08:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
08:58:50.160 --> 08:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
ballot
is

08:58:51.030 --> 08:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
08:58:53.590 --> 08:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
allows us to have a say over our own
 
08:58:55.030 --> 08:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
future and there's a lot of valid
 
08:58:56.468 --> 08:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
questions about like what do we do about
 
08:58:58.868 --> 08:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
the carrots how do we avoid the sticks
 
08:59:00.468 --> 08:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
but the question is
 
08:59:02.388 --> 08:59:02.398 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to do
 
08:59:03.910 --> 08:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
are you trying to grab for carrots are
 
08:59:05.270 --> 08:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
you trying to avoid the sticks are we
 
08:59:07.830 --> 08:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
trying to have our own moral position on
 
08:59:09.350 --> 08:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
on being able to give the voice to the
 
08:59:11.430 --> 08:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire one way or
 
08:59:13.830 --> 08:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
another if they vote against it then i'm
 
08:59:15.590 --> 08:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
sure all of us here would
 
08:59:17.190 --> 08:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
do our best to try to convince them that
 
08:59:19.110 --> 08:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
this is the right path but if there's
 
08:59:20.788 --> 08:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
not enough people to carry it
 
08:59:24.230 --> 08:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
so be it but cacr 32 is about
 
08:59:25.910 --> 08:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
giving us that voice and allowing us
 
08:59:28.868 --> 08:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
that option to move into the future
 
08:59:31.030 --> 08:59:31.040 align:start position:0%

that is as thick as a hair
 
09:02:21.750 --> 09:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
they can inject into our body is it's a
 
09:02:23.430 --> 09:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
chip that is controlled it's like the
 
09:02:25.910 --> 09:02:25.920 align:start position:0%

09:02:57.830 --> 09:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
and in the bible i'm a christian and in
 
09:02:59.190 --> 09:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
the bible
 
09:03:01.910 --> 09:03:01.920 align:start position:0%

peaceful solution
 
09:03:41.030 --> 09:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is the way that we need to give an
 
09:03:43.030 --> 09:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the people to voice up
 
09:03:45.110 --> 09:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
their opinion yes or no at least i have
 
09:03:47.510 --> 09:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
a chance to say it and then we rest with
 
09:03:49.670 --> 09:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
that if we don't give the people that
 
09:03:49.680 --> 09:03:50.708 align:start position:0%
that if we don't give the people that
chance

09:03:50.708 --> 09:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
chance
 
09:03:52.708 --> 09:03:52.718 align:start position:0%

09:05:16.868 --> 09:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
and we can do it again today
 
09:05:19.830 --> 09:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know i came in on mr deshaz's
 
09:05:22.150 --> 09:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
analysis of this particular situation
 
09:05:25.150 --> 09:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
and i have to wonder did he even read
 
09:05:28.868 --> 09:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
cacr32 because we addressed pretty clear
 
09:05:31.190 --> 09:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
he brought up article 7 of the new
 
09:05:32.948 --> 09:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire state constitution's bill of
 
09:05:34.868 --> 09:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
rights and
 
09:05:36.308 --> 09:05:36.318 align:start position:0%
acted as though there was some sort of a
 
09:05:36.318 --> 09:05:37.910 align:start position:0%
acted as though there was some sort of a
conflict

09:05:37.910 --> 09:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
09:05:39.270 --> 09:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's two sentences i'm just going to
 
09:05:40.948 --> 09:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
read it for the record
 
09:05:43.110 --> 09:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
the people of this state have the sole
 
09:05:44.868 --> 09:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
and exclusive right of governing
 
09:05:48.070 --> 09:05:48.080 align:start position:0%

independent state
 
09:05:53.190 --> 09:05:53.200 align:start position:0%

09:06:03.030 --> 09:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
delegated to the united states of
 
09:06:05.990 --> 09:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
america in congress assembled that's a
 
09:06:08.228 --> 09:06:08.238 align:start position:0%
state sovereignty
 
09:06:11.190 --> 09:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
provision that says we're sovereigns
 
09:06:11.200 --> 09:06:12.068 align:start position:0%
provision that says we're sovereigns
and

09:06:12.068 --> 09:06:12.078 align:start position:0%
and
 
09:06:14.630 --> 09:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire joined the union why
 
09:06:16.708 --> 09:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
would we have joined something that we
 
09:06:18.150 --> 09:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't leave
 
09:06:21.190 --> 09:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
if we decided we'd had enough
 
09:06:22.310 --> 09:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
09:06:25.510 --> 09:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
that brings me to a different article
 
09:06:27.748 --> 09:06:27.758 align:start position:0%
in the u.s constitution
 
09:06:27.758 --> 09:06:28.708 align:start position:0%

09:06:28.708 --> 09:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
09:06:30.868 --> 09:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
amendment number 10
 
09:06:33.112 --> 09:06:33.122 align:start position:0%
which says i'm just paraphrasing this
 
09:06:33.122 --> 09:06:33.908 align:start position:0%
which says i'm just paraphrasing this
one

09:06:33.908 --> 09:06:33.918 align:start position:0%
one
 
09:06:35.588 --> 09:06:35.598 align:start position:0%
it says unless something has been
 
09:06:37.510 --> 09:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
expressly delegated
 
09:06:40.868 --> 09:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
to the u.s government some sort of right
 
09:06:43.428 --> 09:06:43.438 align:start position:0%
then they are retained by the states
 
09:06:46.310 --> 09:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
the u.s constitution has rules for
 
09:06:48.708 --> 09:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
joining the union which makes sense
 
09:06:50.388 --> 09:06:50.398 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to just allow anybody
 
09:06:52.310 --> 09:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
to jump into a union they have to have a
 
09:06:52.320 --> 09:06:53.428 align:start position:0%
to jump into a union they have to have a
process

09:06:53.428 --> 09:06:53.438 align:start position:0%
process
 
09:06:55.510 --> 09:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
but the u.s constitution
 
09:06:58.470 --> 09:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
does not have anything about leaving
 
09:07:01.268 --> 09:07:01.278 align:start position:0%
that means mr duchess that that is
 
09:07:04.310 --> 09:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
left to the states to decide
 
09:07:06.790 --> 09:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
so if this state decides
 
09:07:09.428 --> 09:07:09.438 align:start position:0%
by voting more than two-thirds
 
09:07:11.350 --> 09:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
that it's time to say goodbye and
 
09:07:13.990 --> 09:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
peacefully that's also in this
 
09:07:15.510 --> 09:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that it will be
 
09:07:15.520 --> 09:07:17.190 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that it will be
peaceful

09:07:17.190 --> 09:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
peaceful
 
09:07:19.112 --> 09:07:19.122 align:start position:0%
then we can do that and it doesn't
 
09:07:21.428 --> 09:07:21.438 align:start position:0%
matter what some supreme court justices
 
09:07:24.068 --> 09:07:24.078 align:start position:0%
said who lincoln by the way uh put into
 
09:07:26.790 --> 09:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
place in the 1800s
 
09:07:28.790 --> 09:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
so we can do this and there's very
 
09:07:30.150 --> 09:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
little that they can do about it if
 
09:07:32.630 --> 09:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're res if we're ready to go what are
 
09:07:35.350 --> 09:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
they going to do to stop us
 
09:07:37.350 --> 09:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
so we have both article 7 in our new
 
09:07:38.708 --> 09:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution which is all
 
09:07:40.548 --> 09:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
about our state sovereignty and then of
 
09:07:42.470 --> 09:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
course there's article 10 which is the
 
09:07:45.268 --> 09:07:45.278 align:start position:0%
right to revolution it is clear by the
 
09:07:47.990 --> 09:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution that we have
 
09:07:51.030 --> 09:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
the right to say goodbye and break up
 
09:07:53.350 --> 09:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
with this abuser thank you
 
09:07:55.588 --> 09:07:55.598 align:start position:0%

09:08:39.670 --> 09:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
hearing tomorrow
 
09:08:41.428 --> 09:08:41.438 align:start position:0%
uh in the morning then we'll start
 
09:08:43.748 --> 09:08:43.758 align:start position:0%
executing what i have left there to
 
09:08:45.268 --> 09:08:45.278 align:start position:0%
finish up for
 
09:08:47.830 --> 09:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
crossover and everything else
 
09:08:49.748 --> 09:08:49.758 align:start position:0%
my committee will be done with 19 bills
 
09:08:51.190 --> 09:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
well i appreciate you when you do
 
09:08:53.350 --> 09:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
execute this just keep in mind
 
09:08:55.588 --> 09:08:55.598 align:start position:0%
even if you're against independence even
 
09:08:57.670 --> 09:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of the empire
 
09:08:59.830 --> 09:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
in favor of continuing the union you
 
09:09:01.748 --> 09:09:01.758 align:start position:0%
should vote in favor to ought to pass
 
09:09:03.510 --> 09:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
this bill to let the people of new
 
09:09:05.350 --> 09:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire decide because if you think
 
09:09:07.748 --> 09:09:07.758 align:start position:0%
it's a terrible idea to leave surely you
 
09:09:09.428 --> 09:09:09.438 align:start position:0%
think the people of new hampshire agree
 
09:09:10.630 --> 09:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
with you and so therefore they would
 
09:09:12.548 --> 09:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
vote it down uh if it came to their vote
 
09:09:14.068 --> 09:09:14.078 align:start position:0%
in november
 
09:09:15.670 --> 09:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
what's to be afraid of no we're not
 
09:09:17.268 --> 09:09:17.278 align:start position:0%
afraid of nothing right but thank you so
 
09:09:18.388 --> 09:09:18.398 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear at least i'm not
 
09:09:20.630 --> 09:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
anyways good uh representative another
 
09:09:23.268 --> 09:09:23.278 align:start position:0%
maureen here you're not afraid either
 
09:09:25.030 --> 09:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
just quick comment uh
 
09:09:26.708 --> 09:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the chair is planning to
 
09:09:28.310 --> 09:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
exact this and some of you know the
 
09:09:30.790 --> 09:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
process we have hearings and then we get
 
09:09:33.748 --> 09:09:33.758 align:start position:0%
all this testimony then we exec and we
 
09:09:36.310 --> 09:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
discuss the testimony in all kinds of
 
09:09:39.112 --> 09:09:39.122 align:start position:0%
perspectives so i i do not know what's
 
09:09:40.790 --> 09:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to happen in exact session i i
 
09:09:43.830 --> 09:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
really i just don't know uh how
 
09:09:45.990 --> 09:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
all the folks are going to vote we'll
 
09:09:47.268 --> 09:09:47.278 align:start position:0%
talk about it
 
09:09:50.470 --> 09:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the process
 
09:09:53.268 --> 09:09:53.278 align:start position:0%
however it comes out of committee
 
09:09:54.470 --> 09:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
if it goes
 
09:09:55.670 --> 09:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
09:09:57.670 --> 09:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
it will go to the full house
 
09:09:57.680 --> 09:09:59.588 align:start position:0%
it will go to the full house
and

09:09:59.588 --> 09:09:59.598 align:start position:0%
and
 
09:10:01.350 --> 09:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes it goes on to what we call
 
09:10:03.268 --> 09:10:03.278 align:start position:0%
consent that may or may not happen we'll
 
09:10:05.670 --> 09:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
find out tomorrow the consent calendar
 
09:10:07.588 --> 09:10:07.598 align:start position:0%
occurs when
 
09:10:09.990 --> 09:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh this is
 
09:10:12.790 --> 09:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
a measure
 
09:10:15.350 --> 09:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is this is a cacr interesting good
 
09:10:17.588 --> 09:10:17.598 align:start position:0%
to know thank you when
 
09:10:19.350 --> 09:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
just understand that the full house will
 
09:10:21.510 --> 09:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
have a chance to uh
 
09:10:21.520 --> 09:10:22.708 align:start position:0%
have a chance to uh
uh

09:10:22.708 --> 09:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
09:10:24.868 --> 09:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
speak to this to or people at the fellow
 
09:10:28.150 --> 09:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
so i i anticipate that there'll be
 
09:10:29.990 --> 09:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
representatives who will take this to
 
09:10:33.030 --> 09:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
the floor i suspect so and uh give
 
09:10:35.428 --> 09:10:35.438 align:start position:0%
expression to the whole house uh the
 
09:10:37.428 --> 09:10:37.438 align:start position:0%
perspective their perspectives and pass
 
09:10:39.268 --> 09:10:39.278 align:start position:0%
on your perspective so
 
09:10:41.030 --> 09:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have a hearing we have exact session
 
09:10:43.030 --> 09:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow it will go to the full floor in
 
09:10:45.112 --> 09:10:45.122 align:start position:0%
there and there will people i suspect
 
09:10:46.548 --> 09:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
will give voice
 
09:10:49.268 --> 09:10:49.278 align:start position:0%
to your perspectives to the whole house
 
09:10:51.748 --> 09:10:51.758 align:start position:0%
so just so you know that that's in the
 
09:10:53.510 --> 09:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
works and will happen question on the
 
09:10:55.588 --> 09:10:55.598 align:start position:0%
process is it true that because it's a
 
09:10:57.190 --> 09:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that there
 
09:10:58.868 --> 09:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
there has to be a roll call though yes
 
09:11:00.470 --> 09:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
on this yes okay that'll be interesting
 
09:11:01.510 --> 09:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
because then we'll get to see you right
 
09:11:03.112 --> 09:11:03.122 align:start position:0%
you'll get to see uh
 
09:11:03.122 --> 09:11:03.990 align:start position:0%
you'll get to see uh
right

09:11:03.990 --> 09:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
09:11:05.748 --> 09:11:05.758 align:start position:0%
who supports people being able to speak
 
09:11:07.588 --> 09:11:07.598 align:start position:0%
on this because if you vote against it
 
09:11:09.588 --> 09:11:09.598 align:start position:0%
that means you don't well ian you know
 
09:11:11.350 --> 09:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
me a long time and uh i'm going to tell
 
09:11:12.868 --> 09:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
you right now i'm i'm on the fence on
 
09:11:14.790 --> 09:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
this i don't know you know
 
09:11:15.990 --> 09:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
well let me know what it's going to take
 
09:11:18.150 --> 09:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
to get yours
 
09:11:19.670 --> 09:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's not going to take anything i mean
 
09:11:22.310 --> 09:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm a liberty guy myself but i also know
 
09:11:24.790 --> 09:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
in my mind if i was sleeping and
 
09:11:27.748 --> 09:11:27.758 align:start position:0%
dreaming this is a great concept
 
09:11:29.670 --> 09:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
this is awesome i would love to see it
 
09:11:31.350 --> 09:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
but when i wake up in the morning and
 
09:11:33.670 --> 09:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
realize it just can't happen
 
09:11:35.830 --> 09:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know i don't believe it yeah
 
09:11:38.310 --> 09:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
and there's too many ifs and what's in
 
09:11:41.428 --> 09:11:41.438 align:start position:0%
all that in in in raising taxes it's not
 
09:11:43.908 --> 09:11:43.918 align:start position:0%
like back in the 1700s you're raising
 
09:11:46.388 --> 09:11:46.398 align:start position:0%
taxes and every and then services that
 
09:11:48.790 --> 09:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
got to be supported and money that how
 
09:11:50.228 --> 09:11:50.238 align:start position:0%
do we figure out to make up for that
 
09:11:52.068 --> 09:11:52.078 align:start position:0%
federal money that's coming in because
 
09:11:53.908 --> 09:11:53.918 align:start position:0%
we've been eating the carrot for many
 
09:11:55.350 --> 09:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
many years the same thing with our
 
09:11:57.510 --> 09:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
militia so there's a lot involved here
 
09:11:59.030 --> 09:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
that most people don't look at the whole
 
09:11:59.040 --> 09:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
that most people don't look at the whole
puzzle

09:12:00.310 --> 09:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
puzzle
 
09:12:03.030 --> 09:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh you know
 
09:12:05.190 --> 09:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
09:12:07.350 --> 09:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
well i'm just saying i'm a reality type

that um i liked everything that you said
 
09:13:08.228 --> 09:13:08.238 align:start position:0%
and um i wish we could fix our
 
09:13:10.150 --> 09:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
government i wish we could fix our
 
09:13:12.228 --> 09:13:12.238 align:start position:0%
federal government i really do
 
09:13:15.748 --> 09:13:15.758 align:start position:0%
i just don't see it happening um
 
09:13:17.908 --> 09:13:17.918 align:start position:0%
i honestly see the united states going
 
09:13:20.708 --> 09:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
in the direction where we'll we will no
 
09:13:23.268 --> 09:13:23.278 align:start position:0%
longer be free
 
09:13:25.908 --> 09:13:25.918 align:start position:0%
and we'll not no longer be free citizens
 
09:13:28.388 --> 09:13:28.398 align:start position:0%
and this should concern all of us um
 
09:13:30.150 --> 09:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's really scary what's going to be
 
09:13:32.388 --> 09:13:32.398 align:start position:0%
what's going to go down
 
09:13:34.388 --> 09:13:34.398 align:start position:0%
if we just keep going in this direction
 
09:13:36.708 --> 09:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
it's scary for me
 
09:13:38.630 --> 09:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
and my kids this isn't even really
 
09:13:41.030 --> 09:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
mostly about me it's about the children
 
09:13:43.112 --> 09:13:43.122 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i
 
09:13:45.268 --> 09:13:45.278 align:start position:0%
i'm so scared for our children the what
 
09:13:47.268 --> 09:13:47.278 align:start position:0%
kind of what kind of society are they
 
09:13:49.908 --> 09:13:49.918 align:start position:0%
going to grow up in that's what
 
09:13:53.670 --> 09:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
09:13:55.510 --> 09:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
our federal government has never had our
 
09:13:57.510 --> 09:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
best interests at heart and
 
09:13:59.268 --> 09:13:59.278 align:start position:0%
they never will
 
09:14:01.510 --> 09:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
let's just face it they never will
 
09:14:03.268 --> 09:14:03.278 align:start position:0%
we could have the opportunity
 
09:14:05.112 --> 09:14:05.122 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our children to grow up
 
09:14:07.190 --> 09:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
in a free society if we could become our
 
09:14:09.112 --> 09:14:09.122 align:start position:0%
own sovereign nation
 
09:14:11.190 --> 09:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
and if you look at history you can
 
09:14:13.990 --> 09:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
09:14:16.068 --> 09:14:16.078 align:start position:0%
that the elites of this world have been
 
09:14:18.228 --> 09:14:18.238 align:start position:0%
slowly slowly taking away all of our
 
09:14:18.238 --> 09:14:20.068 align:start position:0%
slowly slowly taking away all of our
freedoms

09:14:20.068 --> 09:14:20.078 align:start position:0%
freedoms
 
09:14:22.068 --> 09:14:22.078 align:start position:0%
that our veterans have fought and died
 
09:14:22.078 --> 09:14:24.150 align:start position:0%
that our veterans have fought and died
for

09:14:24.150 --> 09:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
09:14:28.388 --> 09:14:28.398 align:start position:0%
collectively we can we can
 
09:14:30.228 --> 09:14:30.238 align:start position:0%
make this happen we can work together we
 
09:14:32.470 --> 09:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
can make this happen we can do it we can
 
09:14:33.670 --> 09:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
do it
 
09:14:33.680 --> 09:14:35.112 align:start position:0%
do it
um

09:14:35.112 --> 09:14:35.122 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:14:36.708 --> 09:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
i know there's a lot of like you said
 
09:14:38.790 --> 09:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different things like
 
09:14:40.150 --> 09:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
you're not thinking about this you're
 
09:14:42.150 --> 09:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
not thinking about that yeah and i get
 
09:14:44.868 --> 09:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
that i i feel the same way
 
09:14:44.878 --> 09:14:45.830 align:start position:0%
that i i feel the same way
but

09:14:45.830 --> 09:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
09:14:48.548 --> 09:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
we could make this happen as a community
 
09:14:50.388 --> 09:14:50.398 align:start position:0%
we really really could
 
09:14:50.398 --> 09:14:53.670 align:start position:0%
we really really could
um

09:14:53.670 --> 09:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
09:14:55.510 --> 09:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
buck minister fuller said
 
09:14:58.950 --> 09:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
you don't change a system by fighting it
 
09:15:00.708 --> 09:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
you change a system by creating
 
09:15:02.950 --> 09:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
something new that makes the existing
 
09:15:05.588 --> 09:15:05.598 align:start position:0%
system obsolete
 
09:15:07.830 --> 09:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
and we can create something new and i
 
09:15:10.310 --> 09:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
just want to say please support c8
 
09:15:13.030 --> 09:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
cr32 so at least it can be on the
 
09:15:15.510 --> 09:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
november ballot so at least the people
 
09:15:17.588 --> 09:15:17.598 align:start position:0%
can decide
 
09:15:19.670 --> 09:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to me you did a
 
09:15:22.630 --> 09:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
great job melissa uh no
 
09:15:24.150 --> 09:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you um
 
09:15:26.388 --> 09:15:26.398 align:start position:0%
it's really nervous
 
09:15:28.388 --> 09:15:28.398 align:start position:0%
you know um i was glad to see somebody
 
09:15:30.470 --> 09:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
come here up here from londonderry
 
09:15:32.310 --> 09:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
because i can tell you i've got all the
 
09:15:33.748 --> 09:15:33.758 align:start position:0%
emails i got
 
09:15:36.388 --> 09:15:36.398 align:start position:0%
were from all around you know the state
 
09:15:38.950 --> 09:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
or around the country on this issue here
 
09:15:40.708 --> 09:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
not only one for my district in
 
09:15:42.630 --> 09:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
londonderry so apparently
 
09:15:43.748 --> 09:15:43.758 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean it's not that
 
09:15:45.990 --> 09:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
important or they're well working
 
09:15:47.830 --> 09:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
because it's a conservative district i
 
09:15:50.388 --> 09:15:50.398 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened why
 
09:15:50.398 --> 09:15:51.990 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened why
but

09:15:51.990 --> 09:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
09:15:54.310 --> 09:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
at the polls i'm going to ask you here
 
09:15:56.150 --> 09:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
the last six seven years we we've
 
09:15:57.670 --> 09:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
elected people that are voting against
 
09:15:59.990 --> 09:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
second amendment issues first amendment
 
09:16:02.150 --> 09:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
want to take over control voting issues
 
09:16:04.388 --> 09:16:04.398 align:start position:0%
for the whole state instead of
 
09:16:07.190 --> 09:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
going against new hampshire constitution
 
09:16:08.630 --> 09:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be making a difference at
 
09:16:10.630 --> 09:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
the polls we're voting in the same
 
09:16:12.150 --> 09:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
people over and over
 
09:16:15.268 --> 09:16:15.278 align:start position:0%
 
09:16:16.950 --> 09:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
09:16:20.388 --> 09:16:20.398 align:start position:0%
what's happening at the at the polls
 
09:16:24.310 --> 09:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
is we don't have much of many choices
 
09:16:26.150 --> 09:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
they give us these choices
 
09:16:28.310 --> 09:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know and um if you if you want to
 
09:16:29.670 --> 09:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
run for something you either have to
 
09:16:31.112 --> 09:16:31.122 align:start position:0%
have like a lot of money or you have to
 
09:16:34.310 --> 09:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
have i don't have a lot of money okay
 
09:16:35.428 --> 09:16:35.438 align:start position:0%
well i mean
 
09:16:37.030 --> 09:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
maybe at a local level yeah you don't
 
09:16:38.790 --> 09:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
have to but i'm talking about like say
 
09:16:41.350 --> 09:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
the governor you know um somebody that
 
09:16:41.360 --> 09:16:42.470 align:start position:0%
the governor you know um somebody that
that's

09:16:42.470 --> 09:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
09:16:44.830 --> 09:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
high up huh state
 
09:16:45.990 --> 09:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
representatives don't have a lot of
 
09:16:48.708 --> 09:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
money run run for office yeah i would
 
09:16:51.830 --> 09:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
love to um i just don't i don't
 
09:16:53.190 --> 09:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know enough people
 
09:16:54.790 --> 09:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's the thing like me i'm just this
 
09:16:56.388 --> 09:16:56.398 align:start position:0%
little person here
 
09:16:58.950 --> 09:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
and um i'm i mean i'm a strong person
 
09:17:00.708 --> 09:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong but
 
09:17:02.950 --> 09:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have a lot a large following and
 
09:17:04.388 --> 09:17:04.398 align:start position:0%
i feel like you might have to have a
 
09:17:06.068 --> 09:17:06.078 align:start position:0%
large following you know and i don't
 
09:17:07.670 --> 09:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
have that so i don't know that a lot of
 
09:17:10.310 --> 09:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
people would even vote for me but anyway
 
09:17:11.830 --> 09:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
i just think that
 
09:17:15.830 --> 09:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of the voting is set up and it's
 
09:17:17.830 --> 09:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
set up for us to feel you're either you
 
09:17:19.428 --> 09:17:19.438 align:start position:0%
know you're you're you have the left you
 
09:17:20.868 --> 09:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
have the right you have the libertarian
 
09:17:22.868 --> 09:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
in the middle and people are like well
 
09:17:23.588 --> 09:17:23.598 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to vote for the
 
09:17:25.830 --> 09:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
libertarian because one of the i'm just
 
09:17:27.268 --> 09:17:27.278 align:start position:0%
going to vote for the
 
09:17:29.112 --> 09:17:29.122 align:start position:0%
worst of the less evils you i mean the
 
09:17:30.708 --> 09:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
best of the less evils
 
09:17:32.310 --> 09:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
09:17:33.748 --> 09:17:33.758 align:start position:0%
that's what happens and it's gonna
 
09:17:35.670 --> 09:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
happen over and over and over again it's
 
09:17:37.990 --> 09:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
never gonna change and if we want our
 
09:17:39.908 --> 09:17:39.918 align:start position:0%
kids to grow up
 
09:17:41.670 --> 09:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
in a free society if we don't want our
 
09:17:44.950 --> 09:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
kids to be chipped or or transhumanized
 
09:17:46.868 --> 09:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
or anything like that
 
09:17:49.350 --> 09:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
we really really need to to take a look
 
09:17:52.068 --> 09:17:52.078 align:start position:0%
at this in our souls and our hearts
 
09:17:55.030 --> 09:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
everybody here you all have to know
 
09:17:57.350 --> 09:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
that you can feel it in your heart and
 
09:17:59.268 --> 09:17:59.278 align:start position:0%
your soul that
 
09:18:01.428 --> 09:18:01.438 align:start position:0%
something is going wrong something is is

09:19:28.950 --> 09:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
did you know that you should not be
 
09:19:32.390 --> 09:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
discouraged or angry overly angry i hope
 
09:19:35.110 --> 09:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
if this doesn't work out this particular
 
09:19:38.070 --> 09:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
time well we'll know soon but uh
 
09:19:40.230 --> 09:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
did you know that you folks have had a
 
09:19:43.510 --> 09:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
lot of influence on a lot of measures
 
09:19:44.710 --> 09:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that we had a lot of
 
09:19:46.830 --> 09:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
influence on a lot of measures however i
 
09:19:50.790 --> 09:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
did however i do know that we do need
 
09:19:52.710 --> 09:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the votes
 
09:19:55.746 --> 09:19:55.756 align:start position:0%
um i don't think a lot of people
 
09:19:57.830 --> 09:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
even know about this and i say that
 
09:19:59.426 --> 09:19:59.436 align:start position:0%
because i've talked to
 
09:20:01.510 --> 09:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
so many people like because i'll just go
 
09:20:03.110 --> 09:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
up to someone random i know i'm shy but
 
09:20:04.230 --> 09:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'll go up to someone random at the
 
09:20:05.830 --> 09:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
grocery store and be like what do you
 
09:20:07.190 --> 09:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
think about this and this you know what
 
09:20:08.870 --> 09:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
i mean and and people are very concerned
 
09:20:10.070 --> 09:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're like well what does this look
 
09:20:11.426 --> 09:20:11.436 align:start position:0%
like what does that look like if we do
 
09:20:14.230 --> 09:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people do not know
 
09:20:16.870 --> 09:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
that this even exists that they do not
 
09:20:18.630 --> 09:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
even know you'd be surprised they don't
 
09:20:19.990 --> 09:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
know that new hampshire is trying to
 
09:20:20.000 --> 09:20:21.266 align:start position:0%
know that new hampshire is trying to
secede

09:20:21.266 --> 09:20:21.276 align:start position:0%
secede
 
09:20:21.276 --> 09:20:21.990 align:start position:0%
secede
so

09:20:21.990 --> 09:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:20:23.266 --> 09:20:23.276 align:start position:0%
we would
 
09:20:26.230 --> 09:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
if we could like make it more known
 
09:20:26.240 --> 09:20:27.190 align:start position:0%
if we could like make it more known
and

09:20:27.190 --> 09:20:27.200 align:start position:0%

i did run for state house several years
ago

09:21:47.110 --> 09:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
ago
 
09:21:48.710 --> 09:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
did not win but
 
09:21:50.710 --> 09:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
in my fantasy of winning one of my
 
09:21:52.070 --> 09:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
things i wanted to do was be on this
 
09:21:54.550 --> 09:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
committee because this is important work
 
09:21:57.350 --> 09:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
because of me right
 
09:21:58.710 --> 09:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
09:21:59.990 --> 09:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
i would have been glad to be under your
 
09:22:00.000 --> 09:22:01.266 align:start position:0%
i would have been glad to be under your
wing

09:22:01.266 --> 09:22:01.276 align:start position:0%
wing
 
09:22:03.190 --> 09:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
i wanted to object to
 
09:22:05.830 --> 09:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
three things that i've heard here today
 
09:22:07.510 --> 09:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
according to my understanding
 
09:22:09.670 --> 09:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
one is the term perpetual union was
 
09:22:11.510 --> 09:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
09:22:12.630 --> 09:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
if you look in the dictionary under
 
09:22:16.150 --> 09:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
perpetual it means lasting forever
 
09:22:17.586 --> 09:22:17.596 align:start position:0%
you can't write something on down on
 
09:22:19.990 --> 09:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
paper and say it's going to last forever
 
09:22:22.150 --> 09:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
perpetual at that time or in that
 
09:22:22.160 --> 09:22:23.266 align:start position:0%
perpetual at that time or in that
meaning

09:22:23.266 --> 09:22:23.276 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
09:22:24.710 --> 09:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
according to
 
09:22:26.390 --> 09:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it meant there
 
09:22:29.030 --> 09:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
was no fixed end to it
 
09:22:32.470 --> 09:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
09:22:34.470 --> 09:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
another is the word treason was brought
 
09:22:34.480 --> 09:22:35.350 align:start position:0%
another is the word treason was brought
up

09:22:35.350 --> 09:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
09:22:37.586 --> 09:22:37.596 align:start position:0%
and that word's been thrown around a lot
 
09:22:39.350 --> 09:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the last few years
 
09:22:41.110 --> 09:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
the united states constitution defines
 
09:22:41.120 --> 09:22:42.150 align:start position:0%
the united states constitution defines
treason

09:22:42.150 --> 09:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
treason
 
09:22:45.030 --> 09:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
if i recall correctly there's two things
 
09:22:47.190 --> 09:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
making war against the united states and
 
09:22:49.670 --> 09:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
counterfeiting its money
 
09:22:51.350 --> 09:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
nobody's suggesting doing either of
 
09:22:51.360 --> 09:22:53.266 align:start position:0%
nobody's suggesting doing either of
those

09:22:53.266 --> 09:22:53.276 align:start position:0%
those
 
09:22:56.950 --> 09:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
09:22:59.030 --> 09:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
comparing it to children rebelling
 
09:23:00.870 --> 09:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
against their parents
 
09:23:02.710 --> 09:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure every time if you look
 
09:23:04.470 --> 09:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
in a constitution or statutes or
 
09:23:06.310 --> 09:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
whatever when they talk about rebellion
 
09:23:08.390 --> 09:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
against the united states the word armed
 
09:23:13.266 --> 09:23:13.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:23:15.746 --> 09:23:15.756 align:start position:0%
and beyond that
 
09:23:17.586 --> 09:23:17.596 align:start position:0%
this is a this is an important question
 
09:23:19.190 --> 09:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
09:23:19.200 --> 09:23:20.390 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
and

09:23:20.390 --> 09:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
09:23:23.670 --> 09:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
09:23:25.830 --> 09:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
when when the question of
 
09:23:28.950 --> 09:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
leaving britain peacefully or otherwise
 
09:23:30.550 --> 09:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
was brought up
 
09:23:31.906 --> 09:23:31.916 align:start position:0%
or even after that when they were
 
09:23:33.830 --> 09:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
debating what kind of government we
 
09:23:35.670 --> 09:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
should have
 
09:23:37.266 --> 09:23:37.276 align:start position:0%
those debates took
 
09:23:37.276 --> 09:23:38.390 align:start position:0%
those debates took
place

09:23:38.390 --> 09:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
place
 
09:23:40.390 --> 09:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
over the course of months
 
09:23:42.950 --> 09:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the people got involved
 
09:23:42.960 --> 09:23:44.630 align:start position:0%
and the people got involved
um

09:23:44.630 --> 09:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:23:46.790 --> 09:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
as people have said the point here is
 
09:23:48.630 --> 09:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
not to dis to debate whether we should
 
09:23:49.830 --> 09:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
do this or whether we shouldn't as
 
09:23:52.550 --> 09:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
whether to vote on it um and if the vote
 
09:23:54.710 --> 09:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
does get on the ballot
 
09:23:56.630 --> 09:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
i would hope that
 
09:23:58.470 --> 09:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
09:24:00.870 --> 09:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
public debate happens
 
09:24:02.790 --> 09:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
we have a lot more
 
09:24:04.710 --> 09:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
capability to do that than they did back
 
09:24:07.190 --> 09:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
then you know when they were hoping
 
09:24:09.030 --> 09:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
every little newspaper in town might
 
09:24:11.266 --> 09:24:11.276 align:start position:0%
print the latest pamphlet
 
09:24:13.350 --> 09:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
we've got facebook we've got
 
09:24:16.310 --> 09:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
twitter et cetera et cetera and
 
09:24:17.906 --> 09:24:17.916 align:start position:0%
those are good platforms for debate if
 
09:24:19.426 --> 09:24:19.436 align:start position:0%
they will allow it
 
09:24:21.190 --> 09:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
09:24:25.266 --> 09:24:25.276 align:start position:0%
 
09:24:25.276 --> 09:24:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
clearance

09:24:27.190 --> 09:24:27.200 align:start position:0%

09:24:29.110 --> 09:24:29.120 align:start position:0%

okay so
 
09:24:44.550 --> 09:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
that was the question yes the only thing
 
09:24:46.550 --> 09:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
i would like to do is i would like to be
 
09:24:49.030 --> 09:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the record that um i'm not a free
 
09:24:50.790 --> 09:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
stater there were a lot of people here
 
09:24:52.470 --> 09:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
that are not freezing oh i know that
 
09:24:55.426 --> 09:24:55.436 align:start position:0%
okay i was i was born in concord new
 
09:24:58.790 --> 09:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire i've lived here my entire life
 
09:25:01.030 --> 09:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
my family was in new hampshire
 
09:25:02.550 --> 09:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
government as
 
09:25:05.906 --> 09:25:05.916 align:start position:0%
long ago as the 1800s so i just want i
 
09:25:08.950 --> 09:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
just want you to know that there is a
 
09:25:12.870 --> 09:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
lot that this represents i never thought
 
09:25:15.990 --> 09:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
about resigning from the united states
 
09:25:17.830 --> 09:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
but it's come time
 
09:25:21.030 --> 09:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
the state the our federal government has
 
09:25:24.630 --> 09:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
has crossed the line for so many years
 
09:25:27.350 --> 09:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's time to give us the opportunity to
 
09:25:29.670 --> 09:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
at least demonstrate to them that we're
 
09:25:29.680 --> 09:25:31.110 align:start position:0%
at least demonstrate to them that we're
done

09:25:31.110 --> 09:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
done
 
09:25:32.710 --> 09:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to be on the record well i
 
09:25:34.070 --> 09:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
would think that we would give them the
 
09:25:35.586 --> 09:25:35.596 align:start position:0%
opportunity to demonstrate it on the
 
09:25:37.670 --> 09:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
floor of the house whether it comes out
 
09:25:39.266 --> 09:25:39.276 align:start position:0%
of this committee i tell or ought to
 
09:25:39.276 --> 09:25:40.550 align:start position:0%
of this committee i tell or ought to
pass

09:25:40.550 --> 09:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
pass
 
09:25:42.390 --> 09:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
because like i said it's going to take a
 
09:25:43.586 --> 09:25:43.596 align:start position:0%
large vote
 
09:25:44.950 --> 09:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the house depending on how many
 
09:25:47.586 --> 09:25:47.596 align:start position:0%
people show up for the hearings
 
09:25:49.906 --> 09:25:49.916 align:start position:0%
you know at the house
 
09:25:51.670 --> 09:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go ahead and join uh
 
09:25:53.746 --> 09:25:53.756 align:start position:0%
adjourn uh close out constitution
 
09:25:57.426 --> 09:25:57.436 align:start position:0%
amendment 32 and i'll listen say again
 
09:25:59.190 --> 09:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll close the committee by the
 
09:26:01.670 --> 09:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
way but who just had something to say
 
09:26:04.070 --> 09:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
that was me right here mister to your
 
09:26:05.670 --> 09:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
right oh brody go ahead i just want to
 
09:26:08.150 --> 09:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank everyone for coming and i will say
 
09:26:09.990 --> 09:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
i will say the many constitutional
 
09:26:11.830 --> 09:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
scholars that i called about this um
 
09:26:13.426 --> 09:26:13.436 align:start position:0%
they found this fascinating because this
 
09:26:16.070 --> 09:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
is kind of the first time any state has
 
09:26:17.906 --> 09:26:17.916 align:start position:0%
tried to or any entity has tried to
 
09:26:20.710 --> 09:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
amend its constitution probably since
 
09:26:22.390 --> 09:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not sure when i discussed
 
09:26:25.510 --> 09:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
it they weren't sure if any states um
 
09:26:27.586 --> 09:26:27.596 align:start position:0%
when trying to secede from the union
 
09:26:29.350 --> 09:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
back during the civil war had actually
 
09:26:31.110 --> 09:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
tried to do it through amendment and so
 
09:26:32.550 --> 09:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is a it's a very unique thing one
 
09:26:34.470 --> 09:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
scholar actually the one who i cited um
 
09:26:34.480 --> 09:26:35.510 align:start position:0%
scholar actually the one who i cited um
dr

09:26:35.510 --> 09:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
dr
 
09:26:37.746 --> 09:26:37.756 align:start position:0%
david um williams he said that he
 
09:26:39.030 --> 09:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually wants to have a number of
 
09:26:41.110 --> 09:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
scholars maybe look more into this kind
 
09:26:43.030 --> 09:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
of concept and write some papers on it
 
09:26:45.266 --> 09:26:45.276 align:start position:0%
so i thought it was a really interesting
 
09:26:47.110 --> 09:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
intellectual conversation that people
 
09:26:49.190 --> 09:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
brought to the committee today i i was
 
09:26:50.870 --> 09:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know i was very happy that i got the
 
09:26:52.070 --> 09:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look into this and i
 
09:26:53.990 --> 09:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate everyone coming today yeah i
 
09:26:55.190 --> 09:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
definitely want to thank everyone
 
09:26:55.200 --> 09:26:56.470 align:start position:0%
definitely want to thank everyone
speaking

09:26:56.470 --> 09:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
09:26:58.710 --> 09:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
hey one last thing here
 
09:27:00.390 --> 09:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
if you this committee i've been on this
 
09:27:02.310 --> 09:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee in 15 years i'm going to my
 
09:27:04.230 --> 09:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
16th on dealing with constitutional
 
09:27:04.240 --> 09:27:05.426 align:start position:0%
16th on dealing with constitutional
issues

09:27:05.426 --> 09:27:05.436 align:start position:0%
issues
 
09:27:07.190 --> 09:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
if many people come in here want a
 
09:27:09.350 --> 09:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
09:27:11.906 --> 09:27:11.916 align:start position:0%
and they want article 5 or you know
 
09:27:14.150 --> 09:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's two ways on that but if you read
 
09:27:15.830 --> 09:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
the federalist papers why i don't
 
09:27:18.470 --> 09:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
support that stuff is because nowhere
 
09:27:20.310 --> 09:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
does it give the rules
 
09:27:22.310 --> 09:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
many people don't realize the two from
 
09:27:24.390 --> 09:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
new york
 
09:27:26.790 --> 09:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
walked out and never got to vote and
 
09:27:28.710 --> 09:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
there was many silent votes on the
 
09:27:29.830 --> 09:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
change in the
 
09:27:29.840 --> 09:27:31.190 align:start position:0%
change in the
constitution

09:27:31.190 --> 09:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
09:27:31.200 --> 09:27:32.230 align:start position:0%
constitution
that

09:27:32.230 --> 09:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
09:27:35.586 --> 09:27:35.596 align:start position:0%
i myself do not want to happen again so
 
09:27:36.950 --> 09:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind i mean that's why i
 
09:27:43.110 --> 09:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:44.630 --> 09:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
and a half years
 
09:27:47.266 --> 09:27:47.276 align:start position:0%
we started the rochester 912 group in
 
09:27:49.950 --> 09:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
rochester new hampshire we started it in
 
09:27:52.870 --> 09:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
2009 and i want you to know that we have
 
09:27:54.630 --> 09:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
this is the proof
 
09:27:59.820 --> 09:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
09:27:59.830 --> 09:28:05.586 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

09:28:05.586 --> 09:28:05.596 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:05.596 --> 09:28:07.550 align:start position:0%
 
don't

09:28:07.550 --> 09:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't
 
09:28:18.790 --> 09:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:38.950 --> 09:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:38.960 --> 09:28:40.436 align:start position:0%
 
real great
