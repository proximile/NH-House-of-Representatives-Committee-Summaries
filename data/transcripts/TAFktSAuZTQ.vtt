00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
as well and he is substituting for
 
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.830 align:start position:0%
as well and he is substituting for
representative

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
representative vincent
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
so welcome to you both glad to have you
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
we hope to pursue proceed fairly quickly
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
through our list of bills here today
 
00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
through our list of bills here today
if

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
however the
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
discussions drag on to the point where
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
we can't get through everything
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
before 11 30 we will break at 11 30 for
 
00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:06.869 align:start position:0%
before 11 30 we will break at 11 30 for
lunch

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
and then we will come back and finish
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
so with that i think we can begin
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to now open an executive
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
this is a bill to
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the purchase of output of
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
or relative to the burgess biopower
 
00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
or relative to the burgess biopower
facility

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.909 align:start position:0%
facility
and

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
the majority has decided that we are
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to recess
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
this executive session until 10 a.m on
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
10 a.m on april 26th
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
so with that bill being in recess
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
or that executive session being in
 
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
or that executive session being in
recess

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
recess
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
we can now move on to the rest of our
 
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.670 align:start position:0%
we can now move on to the rest of our
agenda

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
we're not necessarily going to be
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
exacting these bills in the order that
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're listed
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the scheduling notice we may take
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
them out of order but we will get
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
through them all eventually
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
so the first bill we're going to do is
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open an exec session on
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 263
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
and i recognize representative platt for
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair i moved to itl senate bill 263.
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.949 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
white

00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
white
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
i second
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
it has been moved and seconded that we
 
00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:46.710 align:start position:0%
it has been moved and seconded that we
judge

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
senate bill 263 to be itl
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
representative platt i would just uh
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
support my motion by saying that this
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
sort of thing can happen without
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
government involvement at all
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
a good point additional comments
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative sabzich
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
um well well i do agree with the
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative platt that this thing
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
could happen without government
 
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
could happen without government
involvement

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think having
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
having our state government
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
make a statement about wanting to have
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
young people involved in some of these
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
issues is also a very powerful statement
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
and if we just say you know
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
you guys can just do this on your own uh
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
bear in mind many of these people many
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
of these young people are minors it's
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
not like they can organize and demand
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
things on their own they need some
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
support and they are the future of this
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
this our state
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's it there's no real big
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
harm in passing this bill
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
because we would just let them have a
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
say at the table we still have the final
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
say on everything so i don't understand
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
the itl here but that's just my opinion
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion on
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
i will vote no one the itl simply
 
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.350 align:start position:0%
i will vote no one the itl simply
because

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
we have experimented in my town with
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
youth on the school board and found that
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
their opinions and their insights
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
are invaluable
 
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.670 align:start position:0%
are invaluable
and

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
i look at some of the youth that have
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
gone through there and now see them on
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
the city council
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
so this to me this youth environmental
 
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.949 align:start position:0%
so this to me this youth environmental
core

00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
core
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
council it's a training ground because
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
let's face it
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
some of us are going to
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to speak for myself have
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
to drop out
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
we just can't do it anymore and some of
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
these people that are on
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
these types of councils and youth
 
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.110 align:start position:0%
these types of councils and youth
forums

00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
forums
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
are going to take our place
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
and i always think that organization
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
with some rules and some
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
ways of operation is much better than
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
just an ad hoc
 
00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:14.949 align:start position:0%
just an ad hoc
committee

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas is
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
recognized well thank you mr chair um
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh i looked at this bill um
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
carefully and was intrigued by it
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
but one of the key
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
points that was made uh during the um
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
hearings i won't say key points but one
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the key references that was made was
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
it was to the education chair uh
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
representative ladd who said that he was
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
in full support of this bill
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh and it would be good for education
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that intrigued me so i asked uh
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative ladd uh the other day
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
what he thought of this bill and he said
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
what bill
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
and i said and i explained to him what
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
the bill was i said you're a co-sponsor
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
on it he says that may be but you know
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh from what you described to the bill
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like something that
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
would be all that beneficial and i
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone called me a long time
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
ago and asked me about it and my name
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
got put on here i really didn't didn't
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
even realize my name was on there he
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
says he doesn't and like was mentioned
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
earlier uh he didn't believe that this
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
type of council needed to have you know
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
government support
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
so after hearing uh representative
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
vlad's comments on that i decided that i
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
would agree with with the motion to ietl
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
something that's best left out
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay further comment on this
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
legislation representative mcgee
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
as i recall the youth who came to
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
testify for us they were quite
 
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.990 align:start position:0%
testify for us they were quite
impressive

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
and they answered every question and
 
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
and they answered every question and
they

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
gave the reasoning behind the bill
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of having their voices included
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
in the conversations that we're having
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i disagree that it's not something
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
government should be doing i think it's
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
one of the easy lifts that we have
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
to enable this type of a council so that
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
the youth can be
 
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.590 align:start position:0%
the youth can be
[Music]

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
present and involved and as
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts alluded to i
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
think i mentioned it in the hearing
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
that a pipeline be set up so that those
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
youth can learn how to interoperate with
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
the government how to get things done
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
i think there's nothing but upside to a
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill like this so i don't understand why
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
we already have a youth advisory council
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the young people who
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
testified was a member of the youth
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
advisory council
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
but seems redundant to create yet
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
another youth advisory council
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
and when i spoke to representative ladd
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
this bill he mentioned that very fact he
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
said we already have a youth advisory
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
council we don't need another one
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
so is there any further
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
discussion of this bill
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll ask the clerk to call

that
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
talk about how we might
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%

there was a lot of ambiguity and a lot
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
of vagueness in the bill
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
and it was suggested
 
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:17.830 align:start position:0%
and it was suggested
by

a wireless deployment initiative and
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
grant fund we already have a
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
broadband deployment initiative and
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
grant fund
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
so this bill creates a similar
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
initiative and fund
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
for wireless
 
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.909 align:start position:0%
for wireless
development

00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact the language of the bill
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
copies or or is a duplicate of the
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
broadband deployment initiative and
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
grant fund bill it's the same
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
basic language
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
although it affects a different part of
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
statute and
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
was changed
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
to focus on wireless as opposed to
 
00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:16.470 align:start position:0%
to focus on wireless as opposed to
broadband

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
senator khan was fine with this
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and there was no opposition to
 
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
amendment and there was no opposition to
it

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
when we discussed it it was
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
the the basic idea of the amendment was
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
discussed at the end of the public
 
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.950 align:start position:0%
discussed at the end of the public
hearing

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.830 align:start position:0%
hearing
and

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i have prepared this amendment
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
to carry through on this effort
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
is the basics of the amendment so is
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
there any discussion on this amendment
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just a couple of
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
first on the bottom of
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
it talks about federal funds received by
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
the state for the purpose of expanding
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
or improving internet access or wireless
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
conductivity should be credited to the
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
wireless deployment grant fund does that
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
how does that match up with the
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
broadband one because you've got
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
improving internet access generally
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
talks about broadband so
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
is the money going to go to the wireless
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
deployment fund or the broadband
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
deployment fund
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
for improving the internet
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and it was raised
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
just this morning
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the word shall on line 37 should
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
probably be may
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
but there was no time to generate a new
 
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.310 align:start position:0%
but there was no time to generate a new
amendment

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
this session here this morning so
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is that we pass this
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
amendment as is
 
00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:49.350 align:start position:0%
amendment as is
and

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
the senate will probably when they see
 
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.270 align:start position:0%
the senate will probably when they see
that

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
word shall instead of may they will
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
probably ask for they will non-concur
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
and ask for a committee of conference
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
and we'll fix that word in the committee
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
of conference okay and a follow-up
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay uh in the
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
just above that in the paragraph it says
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to state appropriations
 
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.310 align:start position:0%
in addition to state appropriations
this

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
bill does not uh amendment does not
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate any money it just makes a
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
depository available if and when money
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
was appropriated whether it from the
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
state of the federal government
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct thank you
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this bill
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
i hate to be a
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
big mouth but i don't think we should
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
wait for the senate to possibly go to a
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
community committee conference
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that they will they
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
may see this and just let it go through
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
if we believe
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
that this should be changed we should
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
change it and if it's such a minor
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
change it can be changed and brought
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
back next week if ols can't get it done
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.230 align:start position:0%
back next week if ols can't get it done
today

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good point representative
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
lewicki uh thank you mr chairman it
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
still isn't clear to me whether we're
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
doing an either or where it's either
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
internet or
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
cell phone service or whether it is two
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that comment
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative creation
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um in the original bill uh it
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
mentions that a municipality is eligible
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
to apply for a grant is that still
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
accurate in this one i only see grants
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
so the bill sets up rulemaking
 
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.269 align:start position:0%
so the bill sets up rulemaking
or

00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
requires rulemaking
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
by the department of business and
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
economic affairs relative to grant
 
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.470 align:start position:0%
economic affairs relative to grant
application

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
and distribution procedures
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
concepts

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
concepts
 
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.310 align:start position:0%
concepts
for

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.590 align:start position:0%
for
rule

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.549 align:start position:0%
rule
making

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that answers your
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
question but uh if you could look at the
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
the paragraphs
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
on page 2 lines 5 through
 
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
on page 2 lines 5 through
15

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
or 16 to see if that answers your
 
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.630 align:start position:0%
or 16 to see if that answers your
question

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just wondering whether um a
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
municipality could be the originator of
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
such a you know a petition for
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
um a project or if it has to come from
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
well there's nothing in this legislation
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
prohibit a municipality from applying
 
00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:55.269 align:start position:0%
prohibit a municipality from applying
for

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
such a project the way i read it
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specifically
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
say that a music municipality can
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
initiate a project but it doesn't say it
 
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.549 align:start position:0%
initiate a project but it doesn't say it
can't

00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
um starting on line 27 that section
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 4 says the department of
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs shall not
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
as a condition of an award of grant
 
00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:19.750 align:start position:0%
as a condition of an award of grant
money

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
impose any requirement state regulation
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
or other term or condition of service
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
that differs from the applicants
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
terms or conditions of service in its
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
other service areas so it's kind of
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
implied that the applicant
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
the utility or
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
or the service provider i guess the
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
service provider exactly yeah but not
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the municipality
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
to representative cretian's point it
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's written
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
so that the applications being made are
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
not being made directly by
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities who might be interested
 
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the grant money so
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that comment
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
i guess uh thank you for taking the
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
question i don't understand that because
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
we a couple of years ago
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
made it so that municipalities
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
could initiate projects
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
by reason of bonding
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
and why municipalities
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
then could not
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
apply for a grant
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
rather than a bond
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know and i think that should be
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
clarified we
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
obviously clear that in all
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
the man machinations about broadband and
 
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
the man machinations about broadband and
cell

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
cell
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
service that we did clearly want
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be able to make
 
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.750 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be able to make
arrangements

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
arrangements
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
to obtain funds to initiate those
 
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.710 align:start position:0%
to obtain funds to initiate those
projects

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.669 align:start position:0%
projects
and

00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
it would it's a different bill but it
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
does one
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
does one overshadow the other or does
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
one go into conflict with the other that
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay we have a couple of folks who
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
helped prepare this uh an amendment here
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
tonight so i'm going to ask them to
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
comment on this question
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
of whether or not this bill excludes
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
a municipality from applying for a grant
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
and if so why
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
please let us know who you are
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
name is maura weston i'm here this
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
morning representing 18t
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
and i have with me owen smith who is the
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
president of att for northern new
 
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.230 align:start position:0%
president of att for northern new
england

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
england
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'll take a stab at answering the
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
question and then i'll let owen fill in
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
in the arena of wireless we're we're
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
talking about quite a different business
 
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.430 align:start position:0%
talking about quite a different business
model

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
than we were with broadband
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
and yes there is the opportunity for
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities to bond
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
to deploy infrastructure in partnership
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
with private providers
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's a very different
 
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.669 align:start position:0%
that's a very different
initiative

00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
than this initiative
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
this is really the creation of a fund
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
for wireless providers
 
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.789 align:start position:0%
for wireless providers
to

00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
apply for grants
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
to deploy in areas where there is no
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
mobile wireless coverage
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason why and here i'll let
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
owen fill in the reason why
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities can't apply
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
for these particular grants
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
is that they don't have spectrum
 
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.710 align:start position:0%
is that they don't have spectrum
so

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
in a wireline world
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
partner with somebody they can acquire
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh fiber
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and they can deploy
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
but that's a very different business
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
model than the wireless world and i'll
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
let owen because he's smarter take it
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
good morning owen smith with at t um and
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
i think mark covered it pretty well
 
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.710 align:start position:0%
i think mark covered it pretty well
we

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
have spent billions of dollars on
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
spectrum so we are using our spectrum
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
that we have here in new hampshire to
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
deploy um as maura stated a municipality
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
would not have that and they would not
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
have the ability to to utilize that
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
with regular wire line broadband they
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
can partner with a consolidated or a
 
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.190 align:start position:0%
can partner with a consolidated or a
comcast

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
comcast
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
that's not how it would work
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
and of course we would work
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
with the municipality of which we wanted
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
to provide service or improved service
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
on their permitting process so that
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
that's how that would work
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay so just to clarify to make and make
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
sure i understand this
 
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.830 align:start position:0%
sure i understand this
100

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying that municipalities can't
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
apply because municipalities
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't have any
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
spectrum to use to develop wireless
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
service okay thank you representative
 
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
service okay thank you representative
harrington

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman another thing to
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
think about is i think was just alluded
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
to is that broadband is over a wire
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
which is a fixed from point a to p point
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
b if you put up a cell tower in town a
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's also going to be broadcasting into
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
maybe town b town d town c who knows
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
where and it's just it's not practical
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
to try to say one town is going to have
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over other towns cell
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
service and let's be honest we really
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
don't want municipalities getting in the
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
business of being telephone companies
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
because they don't know how to do it and
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
most places where attempts like that
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
have been tried to get screwed up
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
completely let's leave the experts do
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
what they're good at and the towns can
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
help with uh coordinating through their
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
permitting process but you really can't
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
have a wireless setup by a town because
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
wireless doesn't know town boundaries it
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop at the town line
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsic
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
coming and taking our question here um
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
let me ask you this why does a
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
for-profit business like yours need a
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
grant to do these things
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
so um i was here a week ago and uh got
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit and i'll speak
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
for for att which is a for profit
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
private company
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
who has spent over the last three years
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
120 million dollars on our network here
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire a lot to do with
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
firstnet which is the public safety
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
network that we built when all is said
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
and done it works for our commercial
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
customers as well
 
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.789 align:start position:0%
customers as well
and

00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
even with that level of investment there
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
are places
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
that still
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
adequate cell coverage and
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
prior to firstnet
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's there was no business case to go
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
into an area
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
in many areas in this many areas that
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in new hampshire and
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere that still need the coverage
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
there's no return on investment
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
we get
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
x amount of money for our budget every
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
year and it's prioritized and you know a
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
town uh like
 
00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
town uh like
um

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
what was the town we used
 
00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
what was the town we used
nelson

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
nelson
 
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.389 align:start position:0%
nelson
um

00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
a town like nelson just isn't a high
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
enough priority for at t to spend its
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
own capital when we need to improve
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
coverage um you know maybe along 93 or
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
in manchester because of capacity it's
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
not that we don't want to but we go
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
through this prioritization
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know if that answers your
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
question with with firstnet with
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
firstnet that went out the window it
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
didn't matter on an roi we committed to
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
building 34 sites here in new hampshire
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other ones and we did it
 
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other ones and we did it
regardless

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.350 align:start position:0%
regardless
follow-up

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
well exactly to the point that you're
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
talking about i understand that some
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
areas are not as profitable because
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
they're so far away or remote or
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to get to but we previously
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
had a bill we were discussing about the
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
carrier of last resort for fixed uh
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
telephone lines and the argument was
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
there is enough wireless options for
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
these people to go to and that's why we
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't need that anymore but it seems to
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
me what you're saying is
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
that you're not obligated to serve those
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
people necessarily if it's not
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
financially viable
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's true we aren't obligated i will
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
say that we have
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
97 of the population covered with
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
wireless um but that doesn't help a
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
little town like lisbon or
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
some of the other towns that would like
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
to have coverage so
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
again i think this is the vehicle to to
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
help get that coverage in those areas
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to go and we're going to
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
improve the coverage in manchester in a
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
long 93
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
just because that's what competition
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
does and uh but some of these smaller
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
areas are gonna
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
um are not gonna get the attention
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
within the time frame that the time
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative flett has a
 
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.389 align:start position:0%
thank you representative flett has a
question

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:21.349 align:start position:0%
question
yes

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
if i were here during the public hearing
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
i could have asked the question but i
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't so i'm doing it now with your
 
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.190 align:start position:0%
wasn't so i'm doing it now with your
permission

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
i view this as sort of akin to the rural
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
electric cooperative model when uh in
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
the 30s when electricity was extended
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
but instead of a government entity it's
 
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.750 align:start position:0%
but instead of a government entity it's
it's

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh using the private entity instead it's
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
the same model is that correct
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
pretty much yes and would you have a uh
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
level of penetration which you can't
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
you can cover profitably so that that's
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
a benchmark when you go in asking for
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
grants that you blow that and here's
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
what you need
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
essentially to
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
to at least break even
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
we won't break even we have operating
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
costs that are associated with a site
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
that we build um
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
in one of these areas that will be for
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
the life of our our term there 20 years
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
30 years plus
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
and so there's a huge operating expense
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
what this does is help us with a capital
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
investment which again would love to go
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
to lisbon but
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
in in the scheme of things in priority
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen for
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
who knows when
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative creation
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up no representative
 
00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.910 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up no representative
mcgee

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
mcgee
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
um mike what's right here
 
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.870 align:start position:0%
um mike what's right here
um

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the various small
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
places that are underserved do you have
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
a plan around how you would be applying
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
for the money because i think
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
the concern that i hear from
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative samsuch and others is
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
that the places that are
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
least well served may be the very last
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
people to be served so
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
so the question would be is there any
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
plan uh for going after this money
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
in order to take those places in the
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
state and bring them up
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
where they need to be
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
and you know are there way more than
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
there's money available or does it seem
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
like this grant program is going to
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
actually help new hampshire
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
solve for all of its gaps so i think
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
this bill will help significantly
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
towards um you know and i think i said
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
this last week i i don't i'm not going
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
to sit here and say that any provider is
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
going to get 100 percent of the state of
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or any other state covered
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's just nearly impossible to do but um
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
you know we can get a lot closer to 100
 
00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:49.030 align:start position:0%
you know we can get a lot closer to 100
percent

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think we're
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know high 80s
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
geographically covered
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
so i think this can can really help is
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
there a plan in place
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
has at t put a plan in place for this
 
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.069 align:start position:0%
has at t put a plan in place for this
funding

00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
we have worked with other municipalities
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
and other states
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
indian tribes and have done a couple of
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
these programs where we have received
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
grants and have built a tower on an
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
indian reservation in nevada that's uh
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
but we're in the very early stages so
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
very much like everybody here we're not
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
sure how this will work uh you know the
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
the devil's in the details and and we
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
are anxious to see
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
um what what the the
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
bea puts together and will work to help
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh make that happen
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
i've been here long enough to see grants
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
that are applied for go awry
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
that we're going to
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
quote unquote to the last mile and we
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't uh
 
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.750 align:start position:0%
don't uh
and

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
that even with this particular federal
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
grant we won't
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
what i'm asking you is when this grant
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
comes out or
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
is as with every federal grant there are
 
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.069 align:start position:0%
is as with every federal grant there are
stipulations

00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
stipulations
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
things that you must do
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
can the state add any stipulations
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
to that grant in other words i'll say
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
nelson and i'm going to plead ignorant i
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't even know where nelson is i'm
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
going to be honest
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
but if they have no service and it is
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
not um
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
business-wise a good investment to
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
invest in nelson is there any way that
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
or the federal government can ensure
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think the way the process will work
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that the bea needs to work
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
all of this out and we would like to
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
work with them on that but um we we
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
would say you know we would like to go
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
to nelson and build a cell site and
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know cover the area
 
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.349 align:start position:0%
you know cover the area
and

00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
i think that would
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
start us with going to the town of
 
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.349 align:start position:0%
start us with going to the town of
nelson

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
nelson
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
and proposing to build a cell site going
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
through their permitting process
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
which would
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
have us show our existing coverage
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
the proposed coverage
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
let's say that they would approve it
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
based on our presentation and all the
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
environmental stuff and so forth that
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
goes through it which takes sometimes a
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
year or two then we would go back to the
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
bea and say
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
here we go so so we've got the permit to
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
build it so can i follow up
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up so now we do have a
 
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.470 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up so now we do have a
process

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:44.750 align:start position:0%
process
to

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.990 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
quasi ensure that towns
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
different towns and different areas
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
by going through the bea can
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
get served
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to add representative pitts
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
i direct you to
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
12065 roman 2 which says very clearly
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
eligible projects shall provide wireless
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in areas unserved by
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
or lacking consistent mobile wireless
 
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.589 align:start position:0%
or lacking consistent mobile wireless
coverage

00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:16.790 align:start position:0%
coverage
and

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
that is uh in the establishment of the
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
initiative itself and then there is a
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
rulemaking section that follows and we
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
again look forward to working with bea
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure those areas uh are prioritized
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
lewicki uh thank you mr chairman thank
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i still have
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
a question as to whether this is a
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
single part of money that covers both uh
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
fiber and cell service or whether we are
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
talking about two separate entities
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
so it's two separate entities um it
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
would be a separate fund for uh mobile
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
wireless which includes um connectivity
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
through the internet but this this would
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
be a mobile wireless 4g lte 5g which
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
which is not only a voice service but
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
it's a data service that's where the
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
internet comes in
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
this question still is if nelson gets
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
a cell tower does that mean that uh
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
some other town roxbury does not get
 
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.950 align:start position:0%
some other town roxbury does not get
fiber

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
fiber
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
additional representative partial
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.430 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
now

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there are
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
several competitors in all of these
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
areas it's not just a t that is built
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
they're building towers
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
and so that would potentially mean that
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
even if a t were to come in and work
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
with nelson to develop cell tower
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
technology in nelson
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
if i'm a us cellular or a verizon
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
customer i'm still going to suffer from
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
lack of service unless i'm calling 9-1-1
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
is that true correct
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
um would you say that to some degree
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps a badly needed subsidy but a
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
subsidy that would uh
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
allow you to divert
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh the other funding to uh
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
rolling out
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
5g technology along the 93 courier
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
manchester places that uh where you
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
can more profitably put your resources
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
where this would
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
potentially under serve those
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
could potentially serve those other
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
underserved areas
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
before you that's hard question before
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
you answer that question i would like to
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
remind the members that we have an
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
amendment before us and your questions
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
should be about the amendment
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
not about the overall subject that the
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
bill addresses
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
maybe face my question then you may
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
refresh your question that's because i i
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
do think the amendment does some
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
distance in covering
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
but i still am concerned that uh
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
even with the amendment the one line
 
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.550 align:start position:0%
even with the amendment the one line
about

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
targeting underserved areas
 
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.030 align:start position:0%
targeting underserved areas
still

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
with that amendment there and with that
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
money available that will mean that you
 
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.589 align:start position:0%
money available that will mean that you
can

00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:17.990 align:start position:0%
can
potentially

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
realize resources
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
other more profitable areas within your
 
00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:25.109 align:start position:0%
other more profitable areas within your
company

00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
so i think i think that's up to the the
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
bea to to help manage um
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know i think we're looking at the
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
areas that need
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
the the most help
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
um you know and i know this area hooks
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
it around 93 is an issue for some
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
providers it's not for us
 
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.710 align:start position:0%
providers it's not for us
so

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think this this
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
grant fund is going to solve all of new
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire's problems and there's no
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
guarantee that um any of these you know
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
nelson will get service but um you know
 
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
nelson will get service but um you know
it's

00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.069 align:start position:0%
it's
it

00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
i i believe this is to truly help in
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further discussion
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative bresny did you have a
 
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.710 align:start position:0%
representative bresny did you have a
question

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
remember it's a question about the
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
amendment only right
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh it wasn't was it a question it was
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
just a comment uh to uh what
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee asked about having
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
a process or i believe um
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
and on page two line 14 it says
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
establishment of a process that promotes
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
wireless connectivity statewide
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
so i assume that will be
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
something that the bea does
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out which towns
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
should have or should be encouraged to
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
get these grants
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i'd like to thank the two
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
of you for answering our questions i
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
think you cleared up a lot of ambiguity
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity thank you
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
and if you could just turn off that
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
microphone there thank you appreciate
 
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.230 align:start position:0%
microphone there thank you appreciate
that

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.430 align:start position:0%
all right so
seeing

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh further dis uh representative
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
creation has a last minute question
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
sorry i do have another question um i
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
was just hoping you could clarify for me
 
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
was just hoping you could clarify for me
so

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
roman three on page one says
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
eligible projects shall be evaluated as
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
part of a competitive process can you
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
just clarify who is going to be doing
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
that evaluation
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
is it the bea
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further comments uh
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative kelly
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't want to step on any toes so
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
i'll keep it brief but my i was just
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
comparing this against the broadband uh
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
initiative package that we passed last
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
year um the my my there are two notable
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
things missing from this bill that were
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
last year's legislation and that were a
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
50 cap on on costs so total cost of the
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
project being 50 percent uh supplied by
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
the broadband provider in this case it
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
would be a wireless provider and then
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
the second one being a
 
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.390 align:start position:0%
the second one being a
uh

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
a stipulation that eligible cost shall
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
not include operating expenses or
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
recurrent costs i don't i just wanted to
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
point that out so you know i had those
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
in front of me okay thank you
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
representative leflam did you have a
 
00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:18.069 align:start position:0%
representative leflam did you have a
comment

00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i guess my comment
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
would have been for the representative
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
from att but i'll put it out there
 
00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:24.710 align:start position:0%
from att but i'll put it out there
anyway

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.829 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
there are areas of the state up in my
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
neck of the woods
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
where major corridors
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
u.s route 2
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
u.s route 3
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire route 16
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
heavily traveled roads which do not have
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
access to cell phone service
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
you're driving along and all of a sudden
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's it you don't have cell phone
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
service anymore and i was curious if
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.390 align:start position:0%
this program
um

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.430 align:start position:0%
um
would

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.790 align:start position:0%
would
enable

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
enable
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
carriers such as a t
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
to it or or encourage them to increase
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh cell phone service even in places
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
that are unincorporated and do not have
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
i'll take a stab at answering that
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
question since you weren't here for the
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of this grant
 
00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.430 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of this grant
initiative

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
is we know the federal government is
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
going to be providing
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
millions possibly even
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
tens or even hundreds of millions of
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
dollars for broadband expansion
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
and potentially wireless expansion
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
and this fund
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
is a place for some of those federal
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
funds to
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
to reside to be deposited in
 
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.309 align:start position:0%
to reside to be deposited in
and

00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
the goal would be
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
to expand
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
wireless coverage
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
wherever it's needed so the answer to
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
your question is yes
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's part of what this is all about
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative partial
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh has it been discussed
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge uh any i any uh
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
potential of sending this to an interim
 
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.230 align:start position:0%
potential of sending this to an interim
study

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
that hadn't uh
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
come up in any of the discussions i've
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
had no i just feel i may i find urgency
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
for a bill to address some of these
 
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.150 align:start position:0%
for a bill to address some of these
areas

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i think this amendment goes a long
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
ways in answering some of my concerns
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
but i still don't know if it really
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
gives me all the solace i would like to
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
go forward to vote for this bill i
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
really i'm still kind of on the fence
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'll be very honest
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
i on the other hand think this is
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
critically necessary to get federal
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
funds when they come instead of missing
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
them and with respect to 50 i don't know
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
if that's applicable to a wireless
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know that could cover the exp
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
cost recovery needs to be higher than
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
that in some cases so just i wouldn't
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
want a hamstring let let the let the
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
process take place
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman may i suggest this
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
we seem to have some
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns here but we also
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
have the issue of who knows when the big
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
federal dump truck is going to load up
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
and say you want your money if we have
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
no place to put it they're just going to
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
go to maine
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
so maybe this committee could have an
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
unofficial committee that gets together
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
with this and then presents some changes
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
to the senate when it goes there because
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
it will have to go back to the senate
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that'll give us an opportunity to
 
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:35.990 align:start position:0%
and that'll give us an opportunity to
address

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
what i think of some legitimate concerns
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
and also not delay for another year with
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
the possibility of losing federal funds
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
so that's a suggestion
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
all right that's a that's an idea
 
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.790 align:start position:0%
all right that's a that's an idea
so

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
i have asked kristen to obtain a new
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that changes the word shall to
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
the word
 
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.790 align:start position:0%
the word
may

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
on um
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
i forget
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
line what 27
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
37 on page two
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
however to follow representative
 
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.390 align:start position:0%
however to follow representative
harrington's

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
harrington's
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion of just a moment ago
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
we could pass this amendment
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
ask the senate to non-concur
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
form a committee of conference
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
and address the issue
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
that representative harrington raised in
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
so i would like to get a sense of the
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
committee of what you would prefer to do
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
we could either pass this amendment
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
with the idea that it would go to a
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
committee of conference or wait for the
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
new amendment
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
which changes the word shall to may
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative pled
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
my druthers is to get the new amendment
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
because it's cleaner and you still may
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
want to discuss with the sun and some
 
00:50:47.839 --> 00:50:50.069 align:start position:0%
want to discuss with the sun and some
changes

00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:53.030 align:start position:0%
changes
okay

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative berezni
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
would any of the changes um that would
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
be discussed in the committee of
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
conference affect the the grant the
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
receiving of the grant part because if
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't then we can just pass this
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
and and have this implemented and then
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh make any small fixes to the
 
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.030 align:start position:0%
uh make any small fixes to the
implementation

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't affect it at all
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
shall or may
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
simply means
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
it must or it can so
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly simple change
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
any further representative callie pitch
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
i would rather wait for the amendment
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's coming rather than pass this
 
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.109 align:start position:0%
that's coming rather than pass this
amendment

00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
and i thought what i heard you say
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative foss was that when this
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
goes back to the senate
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
there may be room for testimony there as
 
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.270 align:start position:0%
there may be room for testimony there as
well

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
well what will happen
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
whether we pass this amendment or
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
a new amendment that changes the word
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
shall to may
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
is that it will go back to the senate
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the senate will have to vote to
 
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.990 align:start position:0%
and the senate will have to vote to
concur

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
concur
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
or to non-concur
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
or to non-concur and request a committee
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
of conference
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
so if we communicate with the senate
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
that we want a committee of conference
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
then we can get one
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they'll they'll go along with
 
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.630 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they'll they'll go along with
that

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
but the first step would be to pass an
 
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.829 align:start position:0%
but the first step would be to pass an
an

00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
amendment and my sense is that the
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee does not want to pass this
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
amendment because it has
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
one word in it that's wrong
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to do next is i'm
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
going to call the role i'm going to ask
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role and ask
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
everybody in the committee to vote no
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
to reject this amendment
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
i will recess this executive session
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
until kristen informs us that she has a
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
new amendment that fixes that one word
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
then we will resume this executive
 
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.790 align:start position:0%
then we will resume this executive
session

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
and pass that amendment
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
so if that seems acceptable to everyone
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
then i'll ask the clerk to call the roll
 
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.150 align:start position:0%
then i'll ask the clerk to call the roll
on

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the amendment whose
 
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
number i don't have 1624h
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
1624h and i urge everyone to vote no

uh two is too absent
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay by a vote of 20 to nothing then we
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
have rejected amendment number 16 24 h
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
and we will await
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
the the arrival of a new amendment
 
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.109 align:start position:0%
the the arrival of a new amendment
which

00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
we don't know when that will happen so
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
so i will recess this executive session
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
on uh house bill 395
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%

00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
so that gives us a new opportunity to
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
second okay representative thomas
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
seconds the motion
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee would you like to
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
discuss the amendment yes thank you
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
um we've had conversations outside of
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
our committee room amongst ourselves um
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
and with other interested stakeholders
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
about what we were attempting to
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish with 262
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
and where sort of the pain points were
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
within our own committee about
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
disagreements about what how far we
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to go and what we wanted to pass
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
within that
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
it removes sections of the bill
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
one two three four five
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then renumbers items six through
 
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.030 align:start position:0%
and then renumbers items six through
nine

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
to be one through four
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
and then this amendment shows the
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
changes in the language what was
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
to what was formally section six so i
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of confusing but
 
00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.670 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of confusing but
um

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
and uh the chairman and i work together
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the language here was
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
acceptable to basically all the
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who had been involved
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we can get passed at
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
this point so
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
what is preserved is
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to be
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
added to
 
00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.349 align:start position:0%
added to
group

00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
net metering with a custom generator so
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
that language is preserved and the
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
interconnection piece that
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
was up uh was a cause for significant
 
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.150 align:start position:0%
was up uh was a cause for significant
concern

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
because there isn't really a process for
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
consistent application of the
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
interconnection fees
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh was preserved
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
and i have to look at the bill to
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
tell you what else is in there i don't
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
know mr chairman if you have anything
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
you want to add
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
while you're looking that up i will just
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
point out
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
that the amended language
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
in the new section one
 
00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.270 align:start position:0%
in the new section one
about

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
group host requirements is a language
 
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.470 align:start position:0%
group host requirements is a language
that

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
we came up with with the help of the
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
department of energy right and
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
basically what it fixes is a problem
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
such as the one exists in londonderry
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
where their fire station has solar
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
panels on the roof
 
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:41.910 align:start position:0%
panels on the roof
or

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere nearby and
 
00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.109 align:start position:0%
somewhere nearby and
they

00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
net meter
 
00:57:46.559 --> 00:57:47.750 align:start position:0%
net meter
that

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
because of the way these the existing
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
statute is worded they cannot become
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
part of a group municipal group
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
group mines
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
so this language fixes that problem so
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
that londonderry's fire
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
fire station could now become part of a
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
municipal group net metering group
 
00:58:14.799 --> 00:58:17.109 align:start position:0%
municipal group net metering group
and

00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
the way the language is worded those are
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
the only persons or the only entities
 
00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:25.349 align:start position:0%
the only persons or the only entities
that

00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
that could do so
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
so that is the
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
explanation for the amendment
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee i don't have the
 
00:58:32.799 --> 00:58:33.670 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee i don't have the
full

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
version of 262 here there's a page

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
so the other sections of the bill that
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
were removed
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
were a variety of sections that expanded
 
00:58:48.079 --> 00:58:48.829 align:start position:0%
were a variety of sections that expanded
net

00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
net
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
mirroring uh changed limits for net
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
metering etc and those uh sections have
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
all been deleted
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%

distributed energy resources
um

00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
findings section which was number seven
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
and then under eight
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
the hosting capacity maps that will be
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
required by the utilities online
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
um and then the interconnection so those
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
are the sections that the the bill will
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
will contain yeah thank you
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further discussion on
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 262
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
see mr chairman excuse me representative
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
harrington thank you uh
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative what was you were you
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
referring to some i i've got a one page
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
one section
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
is there something i'm missing is this
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire bill with this
 
01:00:02.559 --> 01:00:05.349 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire bill with this
correct

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
well it amends the bill by deleting
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
sections one through five and
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
renumbering the original section six
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
through ten to read as one through five
 
01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:13.510 align:start position:0%
through ten to read as one through five
so

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
that is how
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
resource said it was the easiest way to
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
do it so that's why i was explaining to
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
you which sections in the original bill
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
were going to be maintained i also
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
wanted him to put all the language in so
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
we could see it all in front of us but
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
this is the way they do it so
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's just to follow so if i'm correct
 
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.950 align:start position:0%
it's just to follow so if i'm correct
then

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.150 align:start position:0%
then
six

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.030 align:start position:0%
six
uh

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
six through
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
where are we going here six through ten

just to jog your memory
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill came directly from the
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were made by the
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%

which met last fall to determine if
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
there were any improvements that could
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
be made
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
to the site evaluation committee short
 
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.270 align:start position:0%

term
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
while another
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
study committee was formed
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
to pass judgment on the long-term future
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the site evaluation committee
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
the bill is fairly
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
long and complicated makes quite a few
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
changes to the existing site evaluation
 
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.029 align:start position:0%

committee
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
but all of these changes have been
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
received positively
 
01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.549 align:start position:0%
received positively
by

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
the existing members of the site
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee by members of the
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%

the department of energy
 
01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:36.630 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
and

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
to date there's been a little opposition
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
to the changes suggested
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
by this bill
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative harrington who has served
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
on the site evaluation committee and was
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
part of the study committee last fall
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
that came up with these short-term
 
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.109 align:start position:0%
that came up with these short-term
recommendations

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
would like to comment on a few of them
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
first of all it gives the commission
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee more flexibility i mean it
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
sounds a little silly but we literally
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
would spend sometimes hours trying to
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
schedule the next site evaluation
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
committee hearing because you had four
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
or five commissioners and a couple of
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
directors in a room
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
all trying to work their schedules out
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it was really really difficult to do
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
so this means this allows for designees
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
it lowers the amount of the quorum from
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
seven to five which just makes
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
scheduling a lot easier it's it was
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
really difficult to explain to people
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
why the next hearing would be two and a
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
half months away when they wanted to be
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
in two and a half weeks so this will
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
give a lot more flexibility it provides
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
for a training for the site evaluation
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
committee which was never in place
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
before and be quite honest some of the
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
people on that committee had no idea
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
what the subject was as far as citing
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
regulations because it wasn't part of
 
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
their regular job
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
it also allows for
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
a certificate monitoring compliance
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
which was never had no funding in the
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
past so after a project was completed
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh if there was a concern over whether
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
the certificate was being properly
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
implemented uh there was really no
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism for follow-up on that there
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
was no funding for anyone to go out and
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
this would allow for funding so the
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy or department
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
environmental services but that was
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate could send somebody out and
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
say we've got a complaint that you're
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
not complying with a certificate and
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
make some evaluation as to whether that
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
was or wasn't done and it also increases
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
the fees uh basically basically with
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
inflation the last fees i think were
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
eight to ten years ago before they were
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
increased and it just brings them a
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
little bit more in line with that so
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
again as the chairman said this is a uh
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
a short-term fix looking with the the
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
idea of the department of energy whether
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
we need to revise this uh completely
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
which would be the second step for this
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
it also it does impose fines for a
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
violation uh which again was an
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
oversight in the past and was very
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
frustrating especially to the general
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
public involved when they see something
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
that they know wasn't in compliance with
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
a certificate and there was almost no
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism for them to uh to see that be
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
stopped and be addressed so those are
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
the changes i think they're improvements
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
again it's uh
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
not the end of the world on these we'll
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
be looking at it uh with the bill we've
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
already passed with the idea of how does
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
the department of energy fit into this
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
and we need to come look at this
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
completely differently but in the short
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
term we need these fixes
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion to
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
judge this bill ought to pass
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i agree with representing
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
harrington's description of what we're
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
trying to do here and why we're doing it
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think the only
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
issue of contention that came up in our
 
01:09:47.839 --> 01:09:48.950 align:start position:0%
issue of contention that came up in our
caucus

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
was about the fees structure
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
which struck us as being a little
 
01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.189 align:start position:0%
which struck us as being a little
strange

01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
strange
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
this is on page 2
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
lines 25 through 30.
 
01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.790 align:start position:0%
lines 25 through 30.
and

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
the first line is asking for a 1200
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
dollar per megawatt fee for the first 40
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
megawatts of
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
um this was wind wind energy and uh
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
number five was twelve hundred dollars
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
per megawatt for renewable energy
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
generation facilities
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
all the other
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
categories were
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the range of a hundred to uh two
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and these were twelve
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars ten times as much as the
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
other fees and i believe that uh
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham was going to
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
submit an amendment change
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
for to this bill which would change the
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
category number five i believe it's to
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
250 dollars which seems more in line
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
with what's what was listed here so
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
i i know since she is not here i was
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to inquire whether there is an
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
amendment or not
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
that that she has submitted to the
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
committee are you aware of that mr
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
chairman i have seen no amendment no
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
and it was explained to us by the
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy that these numbers
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
were arrived at
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
based on the size of the projects
 
01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:20.470 align:start position:0%
based on the size of the projects
and

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
all the amended
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
all the amendment did was just to adjust
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
those numbers based on the same
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
adjustments that were made to the other
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
numbers in the fees
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chairman i don't believe that we
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
were that that was explained to us how
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
that formula should happen
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
for example that a nuclear generation
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
facility should only be charged 250
 
01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:41.669 align:start position:0%
facility should only be charged 250
dollars

01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
certainly that's a much more complicated
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
facility is it's by square foot is it by
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
what is it by i mean that was not
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
explained to us we know that there is a
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
formula being used but nobody explained
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the formula here and it still doesn't
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
make sense to me that something
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
10 times as much for wind energy and and
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
other renewable energy generations in
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
general should be 10 times as much
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
almost as as the other side doesn't make
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
any sense it's actually makes very good
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
sense because it's by meg it's per
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
megawatt yeah but it's per megawatt for
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
every facility including the nuclear
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
right and nuclear facilities are
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
orders of magnitude
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
greater in size of course than uh
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
renewable generation so the total
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
application fee for a nuclear facility
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
although very high come before the site
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee but but that was
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
not the formula the total size would be
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
that the fee would be much much greater
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes for a large plant than for a small
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
solar or wind uh facility
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative harrington you know maybe
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
one thing that would just help here if
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
we uh just remember that especially when
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
you talk about the renewable energy
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
facilities the overwhelming majority of
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
those facilities are not juris the site
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee does not have
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over because they're in the
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
two four five ten megawatt range and
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's no need to file an application
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
with the site evaluation committee for
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
under 30 megawatts unless the town
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
municipality petitions and requests
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
their help so a lot of those smaller
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
projects that we typically associate
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
with the renewable don't even require
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee so there
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any fee at all
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps a little
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts i'd just
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
like a clarification one of the things
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
we heard was that
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee had a hard
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
time getting a quorum
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
and that members often were
 
01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
and that members often were
unavailable

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
unavailable
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh even to to staff it is this site
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee is just for
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
clarification are they going to be
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
permanent members of the site evaluation
 
01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
permanent members of the site evaluation
committee

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
that will be sitting
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
regularly not once you said once a year
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
maybe once every three years doesn't or
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
you could have 10 petitions in one year
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
just a clarification this legislation
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
does not change the current
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
structure of the site evaluation
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
committee it just modifies
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
some of the legislative components
 
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
some of the legislative components
that

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
that
govern

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
govern
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
the committee's
 
01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.870 align:start position:0%
the committee's
operation

01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
operation
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
now there is another bill that we passed
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
that would create a study committee to
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
look at the long-term future of the site
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee but that bill is a
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
different effort from this bill which is
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
to fix some problems that are known to
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
exist today to see if we can get the
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee to work better well if i may
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
follow up this bill requires training
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
provides training and reduces a quorum
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to invest in training
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
which to me would seem complicated
 
01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:02.950 align:start position:0%
which to me would seem complicated
and

01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to reduce the quorum are
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
these members
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
as stated in you say there's no change
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
but there is a change
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
are they going to be
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
the current members let's put it this
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
way the members who are sitting on the
 
01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.070 align:start position:0%
way the members who are sitting on the
committee

01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.590 align:start position:0%
committee
now

01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes they're the same members
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
this bill only requires fewer of them
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
to constitute a quorum for
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
a meeting
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
so there's no change there no change no
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
well we're going to do training so if
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
they're the same members that are
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
sitting on the committee they they would
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
have been trained i guess
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
so training was part of the site
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.709 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
statute

01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
2016 or 2017 to add training
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
from the department of justice to make
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
sure that new members of the committee
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
fully understood the statute
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
their statutory obligations
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment adds additional training
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
by the department of energy
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
which they have agreed to supply on the
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of the work of the
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee so it's
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
actually an improvement
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the training
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion on this
 
01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.870 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion on this
question

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%

a londonderry fire station that had

and i'll represent it recognize
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
one six 2022164 one h
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
i recognize uh representative thomas
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
second so it's been moved and seconded
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
that we adopt
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment 2022 1641 h which just came to
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
us from
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
there are copies floating around the
 
01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.990 align:start position:0%
there are copies floating around the
room

01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
i think it should probably
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
there must be extra copies uh floating
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
kristen i know i'm sure you obtained
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
adequate copies
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
30 copies so there must be copies
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
all right so this amendment makes one
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
change on page 2 line 14
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
it changed what was the word commission
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
to the word department to make sure
 
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.270 align:start position:0%
to the word department to make sure
that

01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's clear
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
so is there any further discussion of
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment i'll remind members that
 
01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.350 align:start position:0%

the
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
the meat of the amendment is actually
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
5 of the
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
on page 1.
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
those that's the meat of the amendment
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
it adds two new sections to the
 
01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.950 align:start position:0%

legislation

01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
that sets up
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
a condition of approval
 
01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:39.510 align:start position:0%
a condition of approval

bernardi
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
this bill is premature it has some
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
writing difficulties in
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
in multiple
 
01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:35.750 align:start position:0%
in multiple
uh

01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
places it does not use the standard
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
terminology that is used in the very
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
first time
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh explaining what the
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
rationale uh should be or the
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
characteristics should be for for making
 
01:49:50.719 --> 01:49:52.229 align:start position:0%
characteristics should be for for making
decisions

01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
initially it says they must be
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
feasible practical and cost effective in
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
all the other
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
places in the bill it either leaves out
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
makes some other
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
commentary so there's not a consistent
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
methodology for making decisions and
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
managing decisions so
 
01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.870 align:start position:0%
managing decisions so
it's

01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
the concept here is just premature
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
i do believe that uh when we uh the bill
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
was presented by senator waters he
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
addressed that concern
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
and he thought that the language was on
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
would be unnecessarily redundant should
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
all those things appear every time
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that it appears once in the
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
bills establishes the standard
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
and uh my concern with not passing this
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill at this time is that
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
we're charged with saving the citizens
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire uh money where we can
 
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
this is a very cost effective program to
 
01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
this is a very cost effective program to
[Music]

01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
subs uh to save the citizens a
 
01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money and i would
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
further comment on this legislation
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative loicke
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i wonder
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
one thing that doesn't seem to be
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
addressed is the resale value of the
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
vehicles or other uh assets and it may
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
be that we'll save money
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
on operation and then lose it when we
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
try to get rid of them at the end
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
when i've taken bills to ols in the past
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
and there's been repetitive language
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
they have directed it to be removed and
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
only the first word to be included i
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
believe that standard regulatory law
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
practice we we happen to have a lawyer
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the room we could ask mr crease i
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
believe whether in fact uh it is
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
understood that cost-effective um and
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
the other word are also included by by
 
01:51:58.159 --> 01:52:00.950 align:start position:0%
the other word are also included by by
reference

01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh further comments

representative samsich
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
um just to to follow up on uh
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative luiki's comment
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
if you look at vehicles that are now on
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
the market that are
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
hybrid vehicles or even ev vehicles the
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
resale value is is higher than a regular
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle would be these days and it's not
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
going to get any lower than that the
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
other thing is um you know it used to be
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
when i moved into the state
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
20 some years ago
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
or not actually 30 years ago now
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
we used to be a frugal yankee
 
01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
we used to be a frugal yankee
state

01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
we would want to be really cheap with
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
everything we want to save as much money
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
and energy as we can and this bill is
 
01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
kind of directing the state agencies to
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
do the same i don't know why we
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't support that and find a way to
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
say yes to it
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you

pitts

01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
not going for a pulitzer prize on this
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
one i do believe that
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
what we are asking the agencies to do
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
some of which they have implemented but
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
i think we need to put it
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
this puts it on a fast forward basis and
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
gives us a better handle on what's being
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
done and how it's being done
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
i remember the first projects that we
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
had in here that were changed to change
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
the lighting
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
and that saved money
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh and yet when we started it well we
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
can't do that we can't make people
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
change the light bulbs yes we can and i
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
think that there's no problem
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
with passing a bill like this that is
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
going to make in the end
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
the state more efficient and that
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't just include these buildings
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
it includes the buildings we also own in
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
other areas so i think that's really
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
important we may see what's going on
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
here we may see what's happening here
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
but we may not see what's happening in
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
other buildings
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is going to give a
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
report they have to give a report to
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
departments to say what's happening in
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
their other locations
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that's
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
very important especially at this
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
juncture with energy being
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
i believe in a crisis mode right now
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
well second to motion that
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
is in the crisis mode here we had the uh
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the isa folks tell us that we are
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
at capacity uh on very very
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh cold winter uh days and likely when
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
we get very hot summer days
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
and we're adding by this program on an
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
exponential rate a large number of
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
and we're not providing any capacity for
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
generating the power for that
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think these things need to grow
 
01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:09.669 align:start position:0%
i think these things need to grow
organically

01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
organically
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i hold to my original comments that
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that the very first
 
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
time feasible practical and cost
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
effective are mentioned
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
every section refers to different
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
functions different agencies doing
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
doing different things and those words
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
need to be consistent throughout this
 
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.669 align:start position:0%
need to be consistent throughout this
legislation

01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative berezni is
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you chairman uh during
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
the hearings i heard that um the costs
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
of electric vehicles in in the
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is going down
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to be early
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
adopters we can wait a year or two and
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative mcgee
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
make a comment on something that
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi just said about
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
the capacity on the grid i actually was
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
speaking with the iso new england this
 
01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:09.589 align:start position:0%
speaking with the iso new england this
morning

01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
and on on those very issues
 
01:56:12.239 --> 01:56:13.109 align:start position:0%
and on on those very issues
and

01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
we are not at capacity and they are
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
electrifying um and so
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we actually want to go to
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
the iso or talk with the iso more about
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
what is real in terms of you know
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
grid modernization and electrification
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
and all that what the plans are we
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
should do that but i didn't want it to
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
remain in the record that we are at
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
capacity when there are peaks
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
we may have to
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
employ peaking plants for peak demand
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
but we do have adequacy we do we
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
definitely have adequate he said in fact
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
the system is long not short on energy
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have more energy than we need um and
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
so and there is capacity planning going
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
on so it we just shouldn't be saying
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
so was that your regular breakfast uh
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
conference call with isd car on the way
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
here actually it was a return from
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi yeah
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i i don't have
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
regular breakfast calls with the iso
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
folks i do
 
01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:17.669 align:start position:0%
folks i do
recall

01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
earlier this year going to a session
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
that they held for all of us where they
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
gave a report
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we are on the edge of having
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
blackouts if
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
we have rolling blackouts if we have any
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
kind of prolonged cold spell and we just
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
barely made it through this year so
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's on the record that's published
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
that's not any telephone call
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.470 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
oxenam

01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
oxenam
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i understand that
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to be coming back um to
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
consider one of the bills that was on
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
the agenda for today i i'd like to
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
suggest that we take this bill and put
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
it off to that same session so that we
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
can clear up this minor technicality
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
about the language and go forward with
 
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
we are we are confronted with a crisis
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
in the globe and here and we have to do
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
what we can with what we have this is a
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill that will allow us to do
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
cost savings and save energy and save
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
ratepayers money please let us go
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
forward with it
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative platt i just have to say
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
i used to have regular breakfast calls
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
with iso new england but since
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah fred's back there's no question
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
about that at least he's not speaking
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
with a spanish accent after his trip to
 
01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:52.790 align:start position:0%
with a spanish accent after his trip to
mexico

01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
mexico
 
01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:53.510 align:start position:0%
mexico
but

01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh is to follow up on that discussion i
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
mean the letter has been out there by
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
gordon von waldy who's the uh ceo of isl
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
new england made it very clear we got
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
close to we were very close to the edge
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
in fact it was a day in january when i
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
think we're down to about 300 megawatt
 
01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
surplus over going to blackout so this
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
is a real issue that needs to be dealt
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
with but as far as this bill goes there
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
is nothing at all you know i hope this
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
would be without having to have
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
legislation there's nothing that stops
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
any department in the state of new
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire from going out there and
 
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
pursuing an economic way of obtaining
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
their vehicles and if it's going with
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
electric and they feel that's the best
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
way they can do it there's nothing that
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
stops them from doing that that's uh
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
they can use their their own judgment on
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
it so you don't everything does not have
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
to be emanated by the legislature we
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
have some pretty smart people that work
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
for the state and they would figure out
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to go
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%

thank you very much
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
i just like to say that this bill
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
actually is helping us if there is any
 
01:59:57.030 --> 01:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
backlog or lack of energy reducing
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
demand reducing energy use is exactly
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
what helps us not harms us so i don't
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
see what connection there is
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative occident
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr trump i have to
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%

so much of the morning
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
on on the ev issue
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
having a large
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
stock of ebs acts as a battery it can
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
actually help us get through peaks this
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
is a cost-saving measure across the
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
board and i think we should have the
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
same 21-0 vote on it that we had on the
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%

02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.639 --> 02:00:46.470 align:start position:0%

i i just like somebody to refresh my
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
memory uh from the other party i thought
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
at one point the governor
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
had said that this was what was going to
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
happen that the fleet was going to
 
02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:04.550 align:start position:0%
happen that the fleet was going to
become

02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
electrified and that they were going to
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
be replacing vehicles
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
you'd have to ask the governor not i
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the governor you want to
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
make a call
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%

02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
heard that from the governor
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
