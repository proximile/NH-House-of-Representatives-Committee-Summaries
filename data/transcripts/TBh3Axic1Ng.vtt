Bill

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
519 this bill was uh introduced to uh
 
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
the full Committee of Finance uh earlier
 
00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 align:start position:0%
and now it's come to division 3 for uh
 
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
continued followup work I um I want to I
 
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
want to share some thoughts on this um
 
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
um I I I think uh in general there's a
 
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
lot of U favorability towards supporting
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
um uh this organization Waypoint and um
 
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
and because it's coming in as a parallel
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
item to the budget there's typically
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
processes that have us suspend this bill
 
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
one way or the other move it over into
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
the budget um if if we were to do that
 
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
um uh there be no commitment
 
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
on what value we would put on it the
 
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
request was 500,000 a year um we haven't
 
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
done all of the budget work which is why
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
we would suspend this one we don't know
 
00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 align:start position:0%
how much money we have um we don't know
 
00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
if we have any money so so that's got to
 
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
to wait um but uh I I I I think uh we
 
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
need to hear from um Miss Fox uh you
 
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 align:start position:0%

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 align:start position:0%
full testimony last week I I forget your
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 align:start position:0%
so good morning Kya Fox director of the
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health and thank
 
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
you for asking me to speak uh today so
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
as I indicated last week the the
 
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
department is in support of this bill um
 
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
and of this program and this program as
 
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
described last week um was funded in um
 
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
with other funds that were we we found
 
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
that were available to be able to
 
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
provide the half million dollars for the
 
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
program um 100,000 of it was for 24 and
 
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
400,000 was for 25 we have a contract I
 
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
know there was discussion about the
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
oversight of the shelter and we do
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
oversee it with that contractual
 
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.270 align:start position:0%
oversee it with that contractual
obligation

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
be happy to share that with you if you'd
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
like to see it um it was approved I
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
believe it was in February of last year
 
00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
and um it goes through June 30th of this
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
year the shelter is unique and I believe
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
that was described pretty well last week
 
00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
about the population that it serves and
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
the types of services that they provide
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
um with the dropin center and with the
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
cas management that is conducted with
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
those young adults and that includes uh
 
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
work Readiness and um finding uh more
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
permanent Housing
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
Solutions the program as I mentioned
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
again last week um is a key component to
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
two initiatives one is our mission zero
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
which you may be familiar with and
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to become very familiar
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
with after we we present in March uh to
 
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 align:start position:0%
this committee we
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
are um very focused on making sure that
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
if someone needs acute psychiatric care
 
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
they can get that either through New
 
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital or one of our
 
00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facilities in the
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
state as a consequence of the housing
 
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
market being uh tight and the difficulty
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
in finding um appropriate housing uh
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's hard to discharge people once they
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
go into that acute setting and so
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
therefore the so-called back door
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem which then impacts our
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
ability to have people enter into a
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
receiving facility to get the acute care
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
that they need and so this shelter um
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
I've been in touch with New Hampshire
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
hospital and this shelter has provided
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
that back door and that opportunity for
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
young adults to have that up to two
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
weeks to be able to spend um getting
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
that case management and getting
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
everything they need in place to be able
 
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
to transition to the community it also
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
helps the front door in the sense that
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
it is a place when um a young adult does
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
not have another option they don't end
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
up in the emergency department and
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
potentially at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
but that they can go to the shelter and
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
get the services before it rises to the
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
level of needing that uh impatient
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
day this is also part of our children's
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
system of care and even though um you
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
may say based on the age group that's
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
addressed um it's not you go from being
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
um in a a youth or being a child and
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
then immediately become an adult there's
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
that really critical transition time and
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
this is a way that we're able to
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
continue to provide services to youth
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
who are so-called aging out um and and
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
have unique needs that are different
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
from the fully adult population and the
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
youth population um so we consider it
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
part of our children's system of
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
care we um have this in our budget
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
request that is um available on the uh
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
administrative services website uh
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative walner asked me what page
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
it's on so if you're want to know um
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
what page it's on it is uh page 3664 and
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
3665 and that is as part of our
 
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
prioritized need and with that I'd be
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.350 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
may

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
have I I have about three three or four
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm happy to defer to
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
anyone that wants to ask questions
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
first representative
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
walner thank you and thank thank you for
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
giving us the page numbers so we can go
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
get our look through our 3,000 page um
 
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.710 align:start position:0%
get our look through our 3,000 page um
budget

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
so when something is in the prioritize
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
needs the efficiency budget is what
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
basically the department says we've got
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
this is what we have to have in order to
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
run the programs that we're U presently
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
running and that we meet the needs of
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
the uh clients that we already have
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
since this didn't make the efficiency
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's in the prioritize needs budget
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
which means
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
that we may or may not see it in the
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
um I didn't know if you could just
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
remark on the difference between the
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
efficiency and the prioritized
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
needs yeah this is a Nathan white
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
question for our Chief Financial Officer
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
or actually the LBA about the difference
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
between um about how you come about
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
developing an efficiency budget and
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
what's in and what's out um this happens
 
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
to not be in the efficiency budget
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
because of the way in which it was
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
funded with funds that were transferred
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
into the Bureau of children's Behavior
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
Health from Medicaid at that point in
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
time so because of that transfer and it
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't the intended or um the budgeted I
 
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say intended but the budgeted
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
um purpose then it therefore fell out of
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
being considered an efficiency budget um
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
in the efficiency budget prioritized
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
needs are those areas that the
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
department considers critical um and
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
that um will continue a service uh that
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
has been um already stood up you'll see
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
throughout our budget that we have a
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
number of prioritized needs this is
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
among them and and one of them um and we
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
submit our efficiency budget with our
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs and that is published
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
and then um the governor um do goes
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
through a process of um developing in
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
her case uh her budget and in this case
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
and and um when that is published again
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to um the LBA on how it then
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
appears and where um the efficiency and
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs appears um and is made
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
Available to You versus the the
 
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.870 align:start position:0%
Available to You versus the the
governor's

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
budget no thank you did you want me to
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
comment on that or leave it alone I
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
think um there's not really a strict
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
definition of um what makes it into the
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget and what doesn't I
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
know there have been instances of
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that have been recently
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
added through legislation in the last
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
couple years that did not make it into
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
the agency's efficiency budget not
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the case of HHS uh but
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
other agencies um and whether whether
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
that happens on the Department's part or
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's a Das decision or a
 
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
governor's office decision I don't know
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
but it's not something that's strictly
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
adhered to in this case I'm not
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
surprised that it didn't make it in
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't actually part of the
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
budget process it was something that the
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
department chose to do um with existing
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
funds after the budget had passed so it
 
00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
really could have gone into either one
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
in my opinion so so while you have the
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
mic hot uh let me ask you some more
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
questions about the the budget
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
apparently it is already on pages 3664
 
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.550 align:start position:0%
apparently it is already on pages 3664
and

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
665 um does the that section of the
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
budget include a line for revenues for
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
donations um so I need to look that up I
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't have it up in front of me right
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
now that's all right it may end up being
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
a question for U Miss Fox uh and
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
Waypoint um in terms of um how how this
 
00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
budget would operate I would assume that
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
the independence a awayo would
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
remain that um the state would have no
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
indication of the revenues that are
 
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
indication of the revenues that are
being

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
donated uh so we would have no
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
visibility uh after this budget process
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
into how our money would be our money
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
meaning taxpayer money gets co-mingled
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
into meeting the needs of Waypoint that
 
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
that'll that would be transparent to us
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
or or invisible to us rather until
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle is does does that
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
sound about right yes it does I'm still
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
this is still coming up but I'm assuming
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's in the request as a general fund
 
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
request only and you wouldn't see
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
anything internal to waypoint's
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
financial operations in the state budget
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
um all right so so miss Fox I have some
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
questions um that I've never asked
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
before to uh the department and if
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
you're uncomfortable asking answering
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
them or addressing them that's okay um
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it later in another
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
meeting or something but um as as you as
 
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.430 align:start position:0%
meeting or something but um as as you as
you

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
know um the federal government uh is has
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
made a very hot push in the last week to
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
expunge Dei programs throughout a number
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
of federal uh programs I I expect
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
suspect that that those prohibitions
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
will come through CMS as well and be
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
shown up at the doorstep of DHHS at some
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
point um I also am aware that uh there
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
are several bills uh both in the Senate
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
and the house that are trying to make
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
sure that um we uh do not follow or fund
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
Dei policies uh in New
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and so um so my question is
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
in in general
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
um what do you imagine the DHHS role to
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
be to to inform our contractors that
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
they shall not pursue Dei practices
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
should that become our
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
law um and and how how does the
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
department go about enforcing that
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
should should that be a lawful position
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
of the state and the federal
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
government so thank you um for
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
recognizing that I'm probably not the
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
one to answer that question I think that
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
that is a question for um the
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner and for our CFO and for our
 
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
leadership um and obviously any law
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
that's passed in the state of New
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we always um adhere to that
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
and follow through with that um but um
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's not something that I am prepared
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer at this point right
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
I I I I totally realize it caught you
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
off guard and that you're and you have
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
attorneys working for the Department
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
that would help answer that so but could
 
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
you help convey that that's kind of a
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
new set of questions please I'm sure
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
they're watching now or they will be
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
later and yes absolutely okay and I'll
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
come I'll come to you in just a moment
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
and and and the and the reason I'm
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
asking is because uh I've I've had an
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
individual uh share some concern uh with
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
me based on a quick read of the Waypoint
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
annual report that um we need to explore
 
00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the eligibility and
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
the acceptance of of uh people that that
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
received the services um and uh so you
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
can you can stay at the table or or
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
excuse yourself and but I need to ask
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
Waypoint some
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
questions sure I'll step back and if
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
there are additional questions I'll I'll
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
be here all right thank you yeah I'll
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
you come on up and then just state your
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
name for the record
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
please no at the microphone wait the the
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
the trick to this is to get the clerk to
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
properly yes yeah that's even better
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
thank you hi good morning good morning

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
actively seek to to meet as opposed to
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
randomly meet uh and if sexual
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
orientation gets to be uh one of the
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
factors for consideration so so that
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of where I'm going
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's do the whole you know
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
how how how equal is equal um I would
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
love to get started with that if I may
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
so we do serve young people in this
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
shelter that are 18 to 24 years old so
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
they age out on their 25th birthday
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
there is no preference and so that means
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
we don't select or identify a young
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
person based on gender or sexual
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
orientation and we do note that as
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
required by
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
um our federal Partners currently and
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
our data information systems to
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
understand the demographics of young
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
people that we serving and so the
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
shelter is a 14 bed
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
operation and it is an open room and I
 
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
would love for you to come see it so
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
part of this is an open invite for
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
anyone that's interested at this table
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
and Beyond to come and visit the shelter
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's a little difficult to describe
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
without seeing it but we do have half
 
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.310 align:start position:0%
without seeing it but we do have half
pony

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
pony
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
walls um I think that's how you might
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
describe it and so they're not separate
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
rooms but they're half walls which
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
provides male or
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
female um safety and space so the beds
 
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
aren't stacked together they're um to
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
accommodate young people in a singular
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
space and we do have two full-time staff
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
on at all times that are monitoring the
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
space they're doing intakes they're
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
understanding the young people that that
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
are there and what their needs are and
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's an awake overnight position both of
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
those are um and
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
so there isn't preferential
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
treatment we just accept who comes to
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
the center and there has been um a
 
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
the center and there has been um a
historical

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
historical

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
observation that some young people are
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
more likely to experience housing
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
instability or homelessness so we
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
contribute to that data through the
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
homelessness management information
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
system and it's
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
not we don't intentionally like select
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
who stays it's really based on first
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
come first serve as well as some
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerability factors like fleeing
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or leaving trafficking
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
situations um and we have been known to
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
use a random geniz generator which
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
speaks to equality um and that's our
 
00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:53.549 align:start position:0%
speaks to equality um and that's our
current

00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
practice and and what's your typical
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
census you say you have 14 beds MH it is
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
it are you maxed at 14 pretty much yes
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
and we often um each night turn upwards
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
of 20 young people away okay and then is
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
there um with the co-mingling it sounds
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
like it's I I haven't seen the facility
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like it's co-mingled
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
enough to where uh one would reasonably
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
concerned about sexual violence
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
protecting the people that that are in
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
there uh is has there been incidences of
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
of of violence or sexual violence there
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
has not been any reported incidences of
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
sexual violence because again we do have
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
staff up um throughout the night and
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
through the intake process there are
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
some young people that we can't maintain
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
safely in the space so safety is a
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
priority for us and if there are acts of
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
violence or
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
aggression um we respond to that quickly
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
and the young person would be asked to
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
leave and and we've had to call for um
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
assistance with First Responders as well
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
so so I'm very happy that I'm hearing
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that it's a first come first serve that
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
you're collecting the statistics so that
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
we know what's happening in our society
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
we it's it it's important that these
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
Services provided by the state are
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
provided on an e equal basis uh free of
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
any discrimination either in any
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
direction just non-discriminatory
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
um have you with the state in the
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
contract signed um a certification of
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination is that part of the
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
contract I I'm looking at Miss Fox I
 
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
assume that's a standard boilerplate in
 
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.470 align:start position:0%
assume that's a standard boilerplate in
our

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
contracts all right but if I may Mr
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I do believe that that's part
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
of the contract um I I can't recall
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
exactly the language but I think uh
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
certainly the procedures that we have
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
internally speak speak to um sort of
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
really serving anybody that actually
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
comes to our door um and I wish we could
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
actually serve more than 14 and and
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
therefore when we were actually faced to
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
how do we decide which 14 we we said
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
like it needs to be random and I I would
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
say one of the hardest things for our
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
staff is when they have to make the
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
phone calls to the 20 youth that did not
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
make the bed right um so right right
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
right so I'm going to have some
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
Financial questions for you but I'll
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
I'll stop because that completes the I
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
think that subject um are there any
 
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.070 align:start position:0%
think that subject um are there any
other

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
questions uh Senator um representative
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
Daniels right right now I'd like to keep
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
the topic around the whole
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory aspect of this and
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
and just to clean the issue up and put
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
it to bed i' just like to go back to uh
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh you defined youth as being 18 to 24
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh can you define uh young
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
adult Young adult would as I see it and
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
as we've um conceptualized it in the
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
department are the 12 to 17 yearolds
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
that we serve but we do not serve them
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
in this shelter
 
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
environment that's a whole different
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
services does that answer your question
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
well yeah but it almost seem seems
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
flipped I mean I would think that a
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
youth might be 12 to 17 and a young
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
adult we do provide shelter services for
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
12 to 17 year olds in um and we have us
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
with residential facilities um for
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
shortterm stays to support those young
 
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
people that are unaccompanied for up to
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
21 days um in a safe environment that
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
has been vetted by um DHHS and so there
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
are three that we work with throughout
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
our service regions to ensure that those
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
young people are sheltered appropriately
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
reunified with family when appropriately
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
and we um collaborate with the division
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
when there's concern of abuse neglect or
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
a need for a more immediate child
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
welfare response okay so just just for
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
clarity you are
 
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
considering young adults to be 12 to 17
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's how I conceptualize it in terms
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
of the different programs that we
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
provide it what um reprentative when we
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
actually talk about this program we talk
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
about Youth and Young adults um that is
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
the population we serve we start at 12
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as young as 13 and 14 um
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
actually come through our doors and to
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
our attention and but the shelter by
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
licensing uh reasons is only licensed
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
for adults 18 um the licensing for a bed
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
uh has for under 18 has very different
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
um prerequisites that we couldn't yeah
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
and understand I'm just trying to work
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
on the definitions because over the over
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
the course of informational that that's
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
been given to us over the last week so
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing youth defined as different
 
00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.070 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing youth defined as different
things

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
and it's interesting to hear uh someone
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
being called an adult under 18 years of
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
age in in young adults as your
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
definition versus youth I would think of
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
as up until the age of 18 so it just
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
seems sort of flipped in
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
I think I misspoke thank you for
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
clarifying that I did so youth is 12 to
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
17 right I'm muddying the waters thank
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
you so much yeah I am catching up so
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're right young adult 18 to 24
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
25 thank
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
you so representative priest you had
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
your question representative seaworth
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to stay on the topic of of
 
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh eligibility and the the kind of the
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
Dei component is your question in that
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
vein my question is on
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
funding let let's hang on then we're
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
because we're going to come back to
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
money representative seaworth and and
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
mine too is a little on the edge I I
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
something said there reminded me of of
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
things that I heard in the public
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
hearing and I wanted to follow up on
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
this it's not about the eligibility and
 
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
admission policies I don't think so so
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
I'll so just just just so I'll hold mine
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
as well if yes sir thank you I do have a
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
question um regarding the
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
Dei uh is okay
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
um the state is state has a provision in
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
its statutes maybe Constitution that
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
says who they
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
protect um they don't
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
discriminate on gender race sexual
 
00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:54.230 align:start position:0%
discriminate on gender race sexual
orientation

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
race it goes on um and that's in the
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
standard contracts with any nonprofits
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
or firms that
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
contract with the state and I would
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
imagine that would be part of your
 
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.070 align:start position:0%
imagine that would be part of your
contract

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
um with d HHS is that correct is that my
 
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.990 align:start position:0%
um with d HHS is that correct is that my
assumption

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes it is um so as as I
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
think um Mandy Lancaster um you know
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
talked before um we serve anybody that
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually we come in contact to or enters
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
we don't discriminate on Race on age but
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
I actually we don't also have any quotas
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
of we have to serve x amount of or X
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
percentage um and if we don't if you are
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
unable to serve them in our shelter
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
because either age or capacity there are
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
other services that we provide a droping
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
center for example where we can actually
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
um they can receive um services from us
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
as a followup uh so the services are not
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
just for the 14 people that are lucky to
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
get the beds any of those 34 or more
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
people out there youth homeless youth
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
can come in and get the services that
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
you provide under this
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
program absolutely thank you yes my M
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
add so we've been providing services for
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
um Youth and Young adults that are
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness for more than
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
40 years we have about nine or 10
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
different programs and those involve
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
Outreach uh we actually you know walk
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
the streets and find the youth and
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
connect with school systems um they
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
involve dropin centers we have three of
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
them in the state they involve housing
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes temporary housing um we also
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh provide um you know rental assistance
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
so we actually have homes that we pay
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
rent and with landlords um to to um home
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
these youth so there's a myriad of
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
programs and I I might be misquoting but
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
I think we serve about 400 um youth uh
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
um and young adults experiencing
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
homelessness umch in Manchester
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
alone and we can I add to that um we
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
also do provide Family Mediation support
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
and help young people reunify with
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
family or other kin when possible when
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
safe safe when parties are agreeable to
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
that and so the young people that we do
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
end up turning away each night we do our
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
best to triage in the moment a safe
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
space for them to go but we're also
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
working um over time to help them
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
identify something that is um safe and
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
stable and not on the streets of
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester so um so I have questions
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
again about uh admission to the resident
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
portion in the only demographic I'm
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about in this set of questions
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
is U is age uh in in in my experience in
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
the military an 18yearold and a 24 year
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
old are two different cultures um and I
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll just set aside my concerns
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
about intermingling people in those that
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
such a diverse age group um and instead
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
um focus on what is really
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh seems on its face to be great about
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
Waypoint is that you're unique in
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
providing services to this particular
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
young age group and so so because you're
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
so rare and valuable in that regard uh
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
and because you have uh excess of people
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
seeking resident status uh what you
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
could look at the Census Data later and
 
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
maybe share the age demographics with us
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
later but so just from your judgment um
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
what impact would it have if if we were
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
to ask you uh in exchange for State
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
money to modify your age range so it
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
would be something like 18 to 23 18 to
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
22 with the idea that we're we're
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
focusing on that that
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
younger segment while still wanting to
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
fill your beds what what what what
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
impact do you imagine that would have
 
00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
changing the upper age and still
 
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
status um I so the the majority of our
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
young people are certainly within the 18
 
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.509 align:start position:0%
young people are certainly within the 18
to

00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
23 age range and I do agree there is
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
there are developmental needs within
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
that age range which I which again um
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
why it's so important to have qualified
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
staff versus a volunteer base to support
 
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.069 align:start position:0%
staff versus a volunteer base to support
this

00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:07.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
project um there was a time that we
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
served young people up to 21 only and
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
made a commitment to increase to 24 um
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
age out at 25 and I think the benefit
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
was to the larger community and the
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
business community and helping those
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
that are still young adults they're you
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
know prefrontal cortex is not quite
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
developed yet um to move
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
towards uh stability so that they didn't
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
enter into chronic homelessness so I
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly how to answer that
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
but I if if I I so just to summarize the
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
question again the main point of the
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
question is if you lowered the upper age
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh Point could you reduce it while still
 
00:34:57.079 --> 00:34:58.510 align:start position:0%
uh Point could you reduce it while still
maintaining

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
full status full residency status and if
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
so what's it feel like the right age
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
would be to where we could lower it and
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
full I I would say we would have to look
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
at the data but my my general sense
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
without really having data in front of
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
me is that um Our Hope certainly because
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the programs that we provide is that
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
we would have identifi someone
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness before the
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
24th year of age so therefore um they
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
are actually using our services um in
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
the majority at earlier stages of that
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
18 to 24 what I also would say is that
 
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
housing is in such crisis uh right now
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
in the state as you obviously all know
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
well that we actually have to extend the
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
care that we provide to the young adults
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we serve because we cannot find
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
permanent Solutions therefore um we in
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
our programs have extended to 24 to make
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we have more time to find more
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
permanent Solutions U but in terms of
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
the shelter um the the very simple
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is we will have
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
14 bets full uh if we change the age
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely may I add and I'm not I'm not
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that I would direct that
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
I I I would I would just go back to you
 
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
and I would go back to the department
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
say uh you know if all things are
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
equally horrible uh i' I'd rather have a
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
a 24y old without a bed than a 19yearold
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
and and and since this is such a scarce
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
resource it makes me wonder if we should
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh ask you to consider lowering that
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
upper age range um so that we can stay
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
full and and take care of I I presumably
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
even more vulnerable people than the
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
somebody a little older um but so that's
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
just food for thought appreciate it's a
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
really it's a good question and I appre
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question and um we
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
really did make this move to align with
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
HUD priorities so we are um we are a
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
yhdp recipient youth HUD demonstration
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
project and um HUD HUD
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
prioritized um young people up to their
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
25th birthday so that was also in line
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
with our shift so just some additional
 
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
context thank thanks now we see the the
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
heart of the problem of federal
 
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.109 align:start position:0%
heart of the problem of federal
government

00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
but any other questions because I I have
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
some questions about money still uh
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you before you get
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
into the money uh you mentioned that you
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
serve about 400 homeless youth uh how do
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
those we have um well we're required to
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
use a database homelessness management
 
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.309 align:start position:0%
use a database homelessness management
information

00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
systems and so that's where we get that
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
number from and the in the information
 
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
that we enter into
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
hmis um is helpful in many respects but
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's been difficult for us to
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
extract um outcome data it's um counts
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
activities and demographics much better
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
than um we're able to count outcomes
 
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
currently and so we are launching a new
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
system at Waypoint so that we can use
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
our own um management information
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
systems so that we can provide the
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
community with better information around
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
impact and outcomes which is incredibly
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
important and difficult when um I have
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
to indicate that I'm sorry I don't have
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
that answer so um it's twofold okay so
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
so specifically if if one individual uh
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
showed up over the course of the Year 30
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
times at the shelter would that person
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
be counted as one person or 30 one
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
person I I do my very best to D
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
yes um question representative seaworth
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um a little earlier when
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the age the 12-
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
17: 18- 24 you
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the 12 to
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
17 uh you used memos of understanding to
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
accommodate their needs and um being
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
kind of new to this I want to try to get
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
that into a context is that between
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
Wayfair and Facilities is between DHHS
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
and facilities and kind of high level
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about here Theus
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
would be between Waypoint and the
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
licensed facilities
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
yes and just very roughly I'm not
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
chasing detail here but what is the
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
nature of of thatou and what is
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
exchanged how does it work it's pretty
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
thorough um contract between ourselves
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
and the facility and so the facility
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
obligation is primarily to provide um
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
shelter bed and baked into these
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
facilities are holistic programs with
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
clinical staff um pro-social activities
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
Independent Living skills groups so
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
those young people are also part of that
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
Community for the 21 days to really
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
ensure safety it's
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
24hour um supervision with multiple
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
staff communication between Waypoint and
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
that residential facility happens daily
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
21 days is a very short turnaround to
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
work with sometimes identify find where
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
the guardian or parent is and then make
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
movements um in concert with the
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
residential facility and oftentimes
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
we'll let uh dcyf know um pretty
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
immediately if the if it's apparent that
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
you because we're so early in the budget
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
phase there absolutely no promises of
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
any money of any kind um could you give
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
us a sense of uh the impact would be if
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
we were to uh instead of
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
500,000 um made it a quar
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
million or 50,000 or zero those are kind
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
of the levels that we I think we need to
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
understand thank you thank you for the
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman so um in order to
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
actually answer that question I needed
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
to put uh put U the shelter in the
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
context of the rest of the services that
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
we provide for youth um and young adults
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelets and so as I
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned before before we've been
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
providing services for 40 years and the
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
range of services Encompass about $4.5
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
million uh between all of the different
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
Services um we get mostly uh federal
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
grants uh but they often have a match or
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
a ways in which they don't actually fund
 
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
the whole program uh for those programs
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're not receiving State funding
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
currently we have to raise every single
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
year $1.2 million to support those
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
programs and for the last four years um
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
in spite of having to raise that $1.2
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
million we've lost uh north of $400,000
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
in that division um so when we think
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
about if we did not have more funds I
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you that there is absolutely no
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
way I can't personally think that we can
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
raise another half a million dollars to
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
support the shelter um uh it would be
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
too much uh we already have um a
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
significant um um event um the sleepout
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh that last year raised $400,000 we've
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
been doing this for about 10 years um
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
and we've raised every single year more
 
00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
and we've raised every single year more
than

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
$300,000 we have uh for the shelter um
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
in in June uh June 30th of this year it
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
would be uh two and a half years a
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
little more than two and a half years
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we've been operating the shelter at
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
capacity um and the cost really is about
 
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
$600,000 a year so when you do the math
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
math in order to keep it open with the
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
hope that the state was going to partner
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
with us and give us some funding we've
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
had to raise additionally 1.1 million to
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
keep the shelter open so I I I wish I
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
could tell you that I had um the ability
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
to continue to raise we've tapped into
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
all of our major donors we've tapped
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
into every Foundation um and I think
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
their answer often is okay so this is a
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
one time and we're happy to help this is
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
an important issue uh but I don't think
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
it will be sustainable for us to think
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we can commit to uh have no funding
 
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
um in a partnership with the state and
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
open all right so those are all my
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
representative walner this is uh this is
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
sort of your bill do you feel like
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
everything you'd like discussed has had
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
its time to be open
 
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
there I'm fine all right representative
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
Wier uh do you have anything
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes yeah representative uh Rich Neno
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
of just a point of clarification is it
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the facility so
 
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
far as filling beds is 18 to 24 the 12
 
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
to 17 year olds are referred to other
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
facilities that that handle that is that
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
a is that a correct characterization
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's not a cold referral we have a
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
designated staff person that works with
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
12 to 17y olds and so they work doing
 
00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
case management um you know in their
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
office in the facility but the young
 
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
person is right they're referred to be
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
sheltered in another facility but it's
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's a collaboration it's not a go here
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
and we're done no no but I was thinking
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
the question and I think you answered it
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
was it's just
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
18 to 24 that are actually uh in the
 
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
beds at that facility yes absolutely
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay representative PRI thank you
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and thank you
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
again for being here uh you mentioned
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
the funding for this program out of the
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
500,000 that you're asking the state 400
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
is coming from Medicaid
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct and 100 is coming from
 
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.710 align:start position:0%
is that correct and 100 is coming from
the

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
state so um what what I would say and I
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
would ask for uh Miss Fox to sort of
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong when we hit a
 
00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong when we hit a
crisis

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
about um if you have something to say
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
you can take that side mik but I'm sorry
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
to interrupt you no it's okay it's okay
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
my my hand and arm gestures were failing
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
no no I I got the signal it
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
was uh thank you um to clarify the
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
funding was transferred from Medicaid to
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
Children's Behavioral Health through a
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
transfer action um by the fiscal
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
Committee in order to have the funding
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
available for this particular program it
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
is not Medicaid eligible for
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement the type of services that
 
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
they're providing and so therefore that
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
was just a indication by me that when we
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
were talking about whether it was in the
 
00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget or not um and those
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dollars were General funds and
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
they remain General funds so Medicaid
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
really um I'm sorry to have invoked it
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
because it may have been confusing um
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
but that was just how um we were able to
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
fund this shelter within our budget um
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
as it currently stands those funds will
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay okay so for the committee last call
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions um for for for the
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
audience is there anyone that uh wanted
 
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
to speak on this topic I I have another
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
one I'll be back wait a second um anyone
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
in the audience wanting to speak okay
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative priest go ahead thank you
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question again um Miss Fox
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
um when we provide contracts and funding
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
for services for
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
nonprofits is there a
 
00:47:57.559 --> 00:47:59.829 align:start position:0%
nonprofits is there a
percent

00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
of of funds that they have to ra raise
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
to match it which they are doing in
 
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.190 align:start position:0%
to match it which they are doing in
their

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
fundraising it really depends on the
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
contract we don't um unless it is a
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
specific program through the federal
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
government that requires a state match
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
um we typically in our contracts um
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a required match however we
 
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:28.839 align:start position:0%
understood when we entered into this
 
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
contract that it was not the full cost
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
um covering the full cost of the program
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
and we do you're going to have the
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity this afternoon to talk to um
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
our director of contracts um to ask more
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
questions like this um however um I can
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
indicate that it it depends so we have
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
contracts that are 100% um State
 
00:48:56.319 --> 00:48:57.670 align:start position:0%
contracts that are 100% um State
dependent

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
dependent
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
um and then we have organizations such
 
00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
as Waypoint that do a considerable
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
amount of fundraising I would say that
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
most nonprofits have some form of
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
fundraising for to help support their
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
organizations um but it does vary on
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
what the percentage may be um for any
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
particular uh funded program through the
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
state as a followup again to uh
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
Waypoint um you mentioned
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
that you have to raise $1.2 million a
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
year to provide the the valuable
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
services that you provide to the
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
state and that this particular
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
program of
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
housing uh young adults and providing
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
them with valuable services to
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
mainstream them back into the workforce
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
and hopefully get their Liv turned
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
around and provide permanent house I'm
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
I'm coming to the question I'm coming to
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
the question this service costs
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
$600,000 so you have to come up with an
 
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.990 align:start position:0%
$600,000 so you have to come up with an
additional

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to make this project work even
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
with the contribution from the state
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
that is correct and the original ask of
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars was um really
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
before we um had a full year of
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
understanding what the cost are um that
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
was my uh request to um Governor sununu
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
when I met with him and we we needed
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
support to uh run the shelter um and and
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
I felt it was only fair to stick to that
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
number uh but but you right
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative it doesn't cover the the
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
full cost of the program thank
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
you okay I I think we're done with the
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
questions uh I I want I want you to know
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
what's probably going to happen this is
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
this is just sort of a a foggy guess of
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
what the future may look like I don't
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
want you to worry because of the
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
Byzantine nature of the way the
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
legislature works but what what's
 
00:51:11.309 --> 00:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
probably going to happen is uh
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
effectively uh HB
 
00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:16.799 align:start position:0%
519 will will become orphans somehow
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
we'll put it into interim study we'll
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
we'll do something with it because the
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
the subject and scope of of the bill
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to go ahead
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
had migrated over and make it part of
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
our deliberative budget discussions so
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
it won't be lost you may hear something
 
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.390 align:start position:0%
it won't be lost you may hear something
about

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
519 itself that worries you don't don't
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
worry about that keep communication with
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
your friends on the committee don't
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
worry about that I I I can't make any
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
promises of any dollar amount whatsoever
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
we got a huge process we have an agency
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
request of 1.27 billion uh and we don't
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
have that much money so so not
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to be happy at the end
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
of the day um the other thing that might
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
happen to your your orphan Bill we we
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
may uh use it as a vehicle for a
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
non-gain uh bill that's going to get
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
heard later in proper course so so you

519 and it's going off in a direction
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:30.679 align:start position:0%
to start off by covering our it systems
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
and how the integral those are to the
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
programs and the services that we
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
deliver to our citizens I'm then going
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
to move into a discussion around
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
Contracting and some of the Contracting
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
um features and functions and and the
 
02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
types of systems that we use as well as
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
the focus on customer service and its
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
interplay with the road map and then nth
 
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
too is also here and she's going to be
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
talking about some of the functions of
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
quality and performance relative to
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
audits Financial Integrity fraud waste
 
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
and abuse and all of this um is really
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
focused on a strong customer service
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
piece we're always looking at ways to
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
improve the things that we do to make
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
our business easier and to deliver the
 
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
services more effectively to Citizens up
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and with that I will hand
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
it over to
 
02:04:20.549 --> 02:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
Dave okay thank you you have two of the
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
most fun people people at DHHS here if
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
you love numbers and you love
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
technology if if you're not either of
 
02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
those then I apologize for the next two
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
hours um so on page three of your slide
 
02:04:36.549 --> 02:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
deck that you should have in front of
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
you I wanted to give you an overview of
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
sort of our Technology support structure
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't necessarily follow the
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
exact or structure that you hear in
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
terms of Divisions and whatnot so I want
 
02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure we were coming from the
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
same playing field so we have eight
 
02:04:54.189 --> 02:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
course service areas in the organization
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
um beginning with children youth and
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
families Behavioral Health long-term
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
supports and Services Public Health
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
Services Medicaid services economic
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
stability program quality and integrity
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
and our 247 Health Care
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
Facilities but those eight core services
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
are really um supported by a lot of
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
people like myself and others in the
 
02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
room that are behind the scenes and
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's our Communications Group our
 
02:05:23.229 --> 02:05:23.239 align:start position:0%
employees assistance program our
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
information services our facilities
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
management our human resources our
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
finance and procurement Health Equity
 
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
and legal and Regulatory Services I
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
probably left somebody out but I'll be
 
02:05:36.669 --> 02:05:36.679 align:start position:0%
I'll be told later on
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
today yes Mr chair yes I'm looking at
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
this I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm looking to see
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh names of it systems like for example
 
02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh I'm wondering why uh the eligibility
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
system system isn't listed as a core
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
system that's a very good question I
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
would say it's a core system but it's
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
not a core service so the systems
 
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
Provide support to our employees to
 
02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
provide the service thank you for the
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
clarification so then moving from there
 
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
we serve multiple different populations
 
02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
across those different services and
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
you'll hear that through um
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
presentations from our divisions of our
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid beneficiaries um Public Health
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
Services is a population health so it's
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
our entire population they serve so
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
across the Continuum whenever you ask me
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
who do I serve I serve anyone in the in
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so it's basically all
 
02:06:37.390 --> 02:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
of us in this room and anybody else that
 
02:06:39.629 --> 02:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
is receiving services from Health and
 
02:06:39.639 --> 02:06:41.030 align:start position:0%
is receiving services from Health and
Human

02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
Human
 
02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
Services we have a little over 130
 
02:06:47.950 --> 02:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
different um systems I would say if we
 
02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:50.679 align:start position:0%
move to slide four we can talk about
 
02:06:53.709 --> 02:06:53.719 align:start position:0%
some of the department Wide Technology
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
systems and so here's where you'll hear
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
some of those names and and I will get
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
to new heights are integrated
 
02:07:03.069 --> 02:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
eligibility system in a in a moment but
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
at a high level we're trying to work
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
with um we're actually partnering with
 
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology to
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
come up with Enterprise architecture and
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise plans to reduce duplicative
 
02:07:18.669 --> 02:07:18.679 align:start position:0%
effort across our department and doit in
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
many cases is able to reduce duplicative
 
02:07:23.549 --> 02:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
effort across acoss the state so with
 
02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
that we we looked at different platforms
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
and here you'll see eight platforms that
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
we're focused on the first one being
 
02:07:34.510 --> 02:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
Salesforce so you'll hear Salesforce um
 
02:07:37.229 --> 02:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
a lot through the budget presentations
 
02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
in terms if you hear from a technologist
 
02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we're serving our
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
customers our clients our providers and
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
anyone that's in our constituents anyone
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's actually interfacing with thhs
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
Salesforce has been that platform
 
02:07:55.629 --> 02:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
enabler for us to deploy dozens of
 
02:07:58.950 --> 02:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
systems rapidly in a sustainable and
 
02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:00.310 align:start position:0%
systems rapidly in a sustainable and
scalable

02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
scalable
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
way um right now we're actually working
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
on a constituent management system to
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
try to collect information and be able
 
02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
to um route that workflow that to
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
different areas of our agency more
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
effectively to provide rapid responses
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
and and accurate responses that we can
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
follow up on in the future
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
the next one is our portfolio management
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
office and so you'll hear of it as
 
02:08:28.109 --> 02:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
called as an office but it's really like
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh it is its own system it uses a
 
02:08:33.549 --> 02:08:33.559 align:start position:0%
technology called smart sheet and it was
 
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
configured um by our director of project
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
management to really manage a
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
standards-based approach to intake of
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
our projects um and be able to identify
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
the status of the the project in terms
 
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
of its health is it on track is it for
 
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
time is it on track for um uh for
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
resources is on track for money or funds
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
but then it goes further where we
 
02:09:04.149 --> 02:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
actually focus on training over 280
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
people and we'll talk about that in a
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
future slide to be able to adopt this
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
solution and help move us forward in a
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
manner the next um platform and I'm
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
trying to set this stage so you can
 
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
understand some of these components the
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
Enterprise business intelligence system
 
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
is a collection of different tools so
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's not just one thing um you'll hear
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
terminology like data warehouse you'll
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
hear terminology like Enterprise data
 
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
warehouse data
 
02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
analytics um
 
02:09:42.189 --> 02:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
Transformations um data management it's
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
all encompassing of all of that it's one
 
02:09:47.709 --> 02:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
big platform that we've been working on
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
in concert with our federal partners for
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
the last 6 years
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
leveraging Medicaid funds Le leveraging
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh Center for Disease Control and
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
prevention funds and leveraging other
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
Grant funds to be able to build on this
 
02:10:04.549 --> 02:10:04.559 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and we continue to
 
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:06.559 align:start position:0%
leverage federal funds as we go forward
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
to build on this this solution is really
 
02:10:13.149 --> 02:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
where we're managing our governance of
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
how we ensure the privacy and security
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
of data it's where we assign data
 
02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:20.559 align:start position:0%
stewards that are responsible for
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
understanding the laws associated with
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
with the data that they're they're
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
managing and it's where we identify data
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
owners that essentially are ultimately
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for how that data is used
 
02:10:35.229 --> 02:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
within the department and and ensuring
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
that they use it in compliance with
 
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
state and federal
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
laws and the last one on that column is
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
SharePoint and so SharePoint Microsoft
 
02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
teams is a solution that doit has
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
implemented but it's really critical to
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
our functions we used it I used it as
 
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
recently as maybe 5 minutes before today
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
to be able to collaborate on this slide
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
deck to ensure that we weren't sending
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
off 20 different versions and trying to
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
waste effort of different people's times
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
to consolidate it and one of the themes
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
you'll hear and this is something it
 
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
tries to do has been trying to do for
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
over half a century is to automate and
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
provide efficiencies for organizations
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
governments state governments and enable
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
less on the next column we have onbase
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
so onbase is a document management
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
system and retention solution so in in
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
our department we collect lots of data
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
as you know and the goal is to ensure
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
that we collect it and maintain it
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
properly in a place that we know who has
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
access to it
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
when they have access and how long are
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
we supposed to keep it so you'll see as
 
02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
I talk about some of the road map
 
02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
initiatives in future slides one of our
 
02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
road map initiatives is to introduce a
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
more robust data retention strategy and
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to leverage on base to do
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
that the last three here we have is New
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Care Connections which as we
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
move forward a lot of people have heard
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
components of this as referred to as
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
closer referral as well as Point click
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
care or emission discharge transfer
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
solution the New Hampshire Care
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
Connections is really gold at bringing
 
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
together our health care and our Human
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
Service Providers in our state to
 
02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
provide a more Consolidated
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
consent-based and privacy first focused
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
um solution for constituents that are
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
seeking care it could be Food Services
 
02:12:52.669 --> 02:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
it could be Health Services it could be
 
02:12:52.679 --> 02:12:53.830 align:start position:0%
it could be Health Services it could be
Healthcare

02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
Healthcare
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
Services right now if you go to any of
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
those providers they can refer you to
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
different websites they can give you
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
phone numbers to call they can sometimes
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
call for you but they can't actually
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
ensure that you get that call back and
 
02:13:11.790 --> 02:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
that you get those services our goal is
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
to connect people to those Services more
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
effectively using the New Hampshire Care
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
Connections as one of the key
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
Technologies but as as good as any
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
technology is it doesn't go without the
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
programs and so the the key thing that
 
02:13:29.069 --> 02:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
always keep in the back of your mind is
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
all these Technologies are based off of
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
the programs and services that you're
 
02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
going to hear over the next several days
 
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
and through the house
 
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
budget the last two that we have is
 
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
everlaw and learning management system
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
so this past year we were lucky to be
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
able to identify funds that were put
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
into the budget to support ecovery
 
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
and what ecovery is is the ability to re
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
search through different technology
 
02:14:00.549 --> 02:14:00.559 align:start position:0%
systems based off a keywords date ranges
 
02:14:03.549 --> 02:14:03.559 align:start position:0%
or whatnot to be able to respond to um
 
02:14:05.549 --> 02:14:05.559 align:start position:0%
requests like right to no requests
 
02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
associated with 91a or litigation hold
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
um requests in terms of getting the
 
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
information for litigations historically
 
02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:16.559 align:start position:0%
the department has had to identify
 
02:14:21.229 --> 02:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
paralegals and attorneys to comb through
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of emails as well
 
02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
as documents and try to pull those
 
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
keywords out manually which equates to
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
hundreds if not thousands of hours of
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
attorney's time that could be achieved
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
with this tool in minutes and sometimes
 
02:14:39.629 --> 02:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
hours so that was what that that system
 
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
really helped automate a lot of that
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
process and then the last one is
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
learning management system so the
 
02:14:50.109 --> 02:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
department had a key um need in terms of
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
being able to provide training for both
 
02:14:54.189 --> 02:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
our internal Workforce as well as our
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
providers that we require them to go
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
through certain training in order to be
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
licensed the current state system is an
 
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
internal only focus system so we
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
deployed our own learn learning
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
management system in partnership with
 
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
administrative services and Department
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
of Information Technology that allows us
 
02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
to publish our internal trainings and
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
work across our department to pull those
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
in and not only just publish them in
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
train but be able to tr back and report
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
on successful trainings people that
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
haven't done the training so we can
 
02:15:29.149 --> 02:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
follow up and make sure that they
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
perform that state and federally
 
02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:32.870 align:start position:0%
perform that state and federally
mandated

02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
training I'll pause for a second if
 
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
there's any questions otherwise I'll
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
continue representative Stringham yeah
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh new New Hampshire uh Care
 
02:15:47.069 --> 02:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
Connections is that the system that uh
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
for example the uh disability providers
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
are are accessing and using to submit
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
invoices uh and get paid by the system
 
02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
or um is it something else I have a
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
couple followups so I'll follow you
 
02:16:05.709 --> 02:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
process all right I'm I'll I'll I'll
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
explain the methodology here again um
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
because representative priest I fell
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
into the same traditional habit of
 
02:16:13.639 --> 02:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
into the same traditional habit of
committee

02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:16:17.310 --> 02:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
behavior when when you get when I give
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
you the floor go ahead and engage in a
 
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
good conver ational set a Q&amp;A back and
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
forth have a dialogue um and as long as
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
you're staying on track and and you know
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
consistent you're not straying off or
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
getting argumentative I'll let you have
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
a informative conversation without
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
coming back for asking for followup all
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
the time that feels a little unnatural
 
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
let's let's just have good conversations
 
02:16:46.509 --> 02:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for the question um the
 
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities agencies and
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
providers are actually using our new
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
height system system that was recently
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
expanded for managing case management
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
components um and I I know Karen Hebert
 
02:17:00.270 --> 02:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
is here to see if she wants to come up
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
and correct
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
me no sorry Melissa Hardy I'm right okay
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure we do have
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
people members in the audience to make
 
02:17:11.309 --> 02:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
sure that if I say something inaccurate
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
we can be corrected um so that New
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Care Connections however all
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
the providers can participate in that
 
02:17:22.110 --> 02:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
for to be able to provide referrals to
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
other services so say someone's at an
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
area agency and they're utilizing the
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
developmental disability solution in New
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
Heights our integrated eligibility and
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment system but they find that
 
02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
that individual may need other services
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
like um Food Services or shelter or
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
mental health services they can
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
certainly use the New Hampshire Care
 
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
Connections to do that um and provide
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
that referral to other
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
providers so kind of a followup then
 
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
where would the um uh it would you would
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
you use one of your systems to query
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
about the utilization of services within
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
some of the uh groups like new new
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
Heights or uh for example um one
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
particular type of service in
 
02:18:10.399 --> 02:18:11.549 align:start position:0%
particular type of service in
developmental

02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
disability um is is that something in
 
02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
your analytics for example that that is
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
is uh is accessible at this point
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
or is that still growing that's a good
 
02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
question I would think that I I would
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
like to take that back and maybe have
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
that answered in a future presentation
 
02:18:30.509 --> 02:18:30.519 align:start position:0%
from the program
 
02:18:32.830 --> 02:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
area so we we'll make sure we make a
 
02:18:34.509 --> 02:18:34.519 align:start position:0%
note of any of these questions that are
 
02:18:36.429 --> 02:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
somewhat technical but also programmatic
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
related that I don't want to misspeak
 
02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.389 --> 02:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
you you still have your mic on um you
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
still have your mic on uh let's let's
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
get closer to the mic when we talk I I
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
have an ADA problem I just cannot hear
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
very well unless people are using the
 
02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
system um I I have a question about New
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Care Connections is this
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
where the closed loop referral system is
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
that is correct Mr chair okay and then
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh I flipped through here I didn't see a
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
specific uh part of the presentation
 
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
related to the closed loop referral
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
system I I think later at another time
 
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
we we'd like an update on the closed
 
02:19:22.750 --> 02:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
loop ref referral system specifically
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
terms of uh what it what it's costing
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
what it what we're doing to integrate it
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
with the MC's closed loop referral
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
systems or whatever they call it um
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
where you're at with the any privacy and
 
02:19:37.709 --> 02:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
security issues related to it because it
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
was a I I I think initially I it
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
appeared to be a really high privacy
 
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
risk and uh I I know you've been
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
mitigating it I just think we need an
 
02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
update absolutely Mr chair I would plan
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
on bringing that up in the house
 
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
division 3 um budget presentations if
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
that works for you right right um and
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
just as long as we're talking about that
 
02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
um would you bring with you a list of
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
systems that you're decommissioning in
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
this budget and what money is going to
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
be freed up as a result of
 
02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:14.550 align:start position:0%
be freed up as a result of
decommissioning

02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a a general question maybe
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be covered later but um
 
02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
how much of the systems that we're
 
02:20:30.910 --> 02:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
employing right now are cloud-based and
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
then the second question
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
is is there any impact as yet on
 
02:20:38.349 --> 02:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence and and what you
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
systems very good questions thank you um
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
so the first question of how many are
 
02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:51.190 align:start position:0%
so the first question of how many are
cloud-based

02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
cloud-based
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
I would I would say I don't know the
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
exact number but more often than not
 
02:20:57.070 --> 02:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
systems are going to the cloud at this
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
point so our the Salesforce solution for
 
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
example is all cloud-based and many of
 
02:21:06.190 --> 02:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
our systems I can certainly speak to
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
them as I go through I will make sure
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
that notate that's a cloud-based
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
solution versus an on premise I would
 
02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
say any new solution that we're moving
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
forward I would doubt would be on
 
02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
premise unless there was a federal or
 
02:21:19.389 --> 02:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
state mandate to do
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
so okay and then for your second
 
02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
question in terms of impact of
 
02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence and our systems
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
we have certainly engaged with our
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
vendors to discuss options uh
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
surrounding artificial intelligence
 
02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
however with there's a lot of concerns
 
02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
about how we would manage the data how
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
we would ensure that the large language
 
02:21:43.630 --> 02:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
model would be ours and not exposed to
 
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
um a vendor so we haven't actually
 
02:21:48.510 --> 02:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
really Doven into taking our data sets
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
into those environments um we are
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
currently engaging with a vendor for our
 
02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility system to
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
identify some key key areas that we
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
might be able to achieve quicker
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
processing of like reading through
 
02:22:05.950 --> 02:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures which are public
 
02:22:08.190 --> 02:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
documents and being able to provide that
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
information in a quick way to our
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives as well as looking at
 
02:22:16.830 --> 02:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
how we can manage a internal um AI
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
solution but right now nothing's
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
implemented um we are partnering with
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
the I know that they have some
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
initiatives across the state that
 
02:22:30.590 --> 02:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're working on it thank you so okay
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh earlier
 
02:22:38.359 --> 02:22:39.870 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh earlier
today

02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
we yeah really okay can you hear me now
 
02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you okay earlier today we
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
had a great presentation from uh on a
 
02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:51.150 align:start position:0%
had a great presentation from uh on a
bill

02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh that we're considering um regarding
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
funding for a young adults um homeless
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
program provided by
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
WellPoint and with that service since
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's funded now through by
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS would that fall within the New
 
02:23:13.269 --> 02:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Care
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
Connections as a service that would come
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
up on your board and you could direct
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
people or towns to for these services
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
02:23:27.790 --> 02:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
providing thank you for the question
 
02:23:29.710 --> 02:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh I believe I would need
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
to dig in further to this specific bill
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to and work with
 
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
the program areas to come up with a
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
determination of whether or not New
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Care Connections or some other
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
solution might be applicable to provide
 
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
those Services is there could you share
 
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
with me the bill that you were referring
 
02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
to the bill number was can can I cut to
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
the chase on this I think that's going
 
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
to come up in the closed loop referral
 
02:23:54.510 --> 02:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
system I interpret his question
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
primarily to be is is Waypoint in fact
 
02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
already a client in the closed loop
 
02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
referral system and then therefore part
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
of the network and I think when you come
 
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
back to talk about the closed loop
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
referral system uh representative priest
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
if you can wait till then your questions
 
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
I think will be addressed because you
 
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it was a part of the New
 
02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Care Connection so we'll wait
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
until then yeah I you you asked
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
specifically if Waypoint was a client in
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
the closed loop referral system that's
 
02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
the way I interpreted your question
 
02:24:29.790 --> 02:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
right and and he he doesn't have The
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
Client List in front of him so okay I
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
understand thank you and the house bill
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
is the house bill is HB
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
you I do have one answer to that
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
question and maybe if you're okay I can
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
move on um in terms of where we're at
 
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
with the Clos Loop referral solution
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
right now as we're still finalizing our
 
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
foundations we are moving into um a
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
starting engagement of providers in the
 
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
next couple months um so there was an
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
implementation of our closeup referral
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
four years ago that we terminated the
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
contract with but actually still exists
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire today um the vendor has
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually been providing that service for
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
providers not for the state but for
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
providers is my understanding and so
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
Waypoint may be a part of that Network
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I I will certainly reach out and um
 
02:25:26.349 --> 02:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that um we partner with unit
 
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
us our contractor and understand how how
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
equation so moving on to slide
 
02:25:42.269 --> 02:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
five I ask you a question about ever law
 
02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
certainly um okay so this jumps out at
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
me because um I've been involved in some
 
02:25:49.870 --> 02:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
right to know legislation this term
 
02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:50.950 align:start position:0%
right to know legislation this term
already

02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:25:54.349 --> 02:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
and and um there's a belief uh among
 
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
some of the people in the
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that they can respond to
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
right to know just by emailing a
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
document um and I don't think that's
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
adequate for the task certainly not to
 
02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
scale so knowing that you use ever law
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about licensing and
 
02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
scalability is is is do we have a system
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
this comes from doit do we we have a
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
system that's capable of scaling to
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
support Municipal requirements to
 
02:26:30.030 --> 02:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
support right to know and I'll take a
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
future answer on that because that's a
 
02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
bunch I'll certainly take it back I
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
would say right now we we would be able
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
to scale it um but we would need
 
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
additional funding because the way
 
02:26:44.349 --> 02:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
everlaw works is based off a storage
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
space so every case or every request
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
utilizes that storage space we currently
 
02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
don't have enough storage to manage more
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
than a few cases at a time yeah don't
 
02:26:57.309 --> 02:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
put a lot into it this is one of those
 
02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
8020 things for 20% of the effort I'll
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'll get the answer I'm looking for
 
02:27:05.269 --> 02:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
chair so on Slide Five I'm going to go
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
through quickly the the role of the
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
portfolio management office I was
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
referring to earlier today so this the
 
02:27:18.510 --> 02:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
pmo it operates underneath the
 
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
information Services um Bureau and its
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
goal is to really align our projects to
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
the Department's goals and objectives
 
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
and missions and values as we go forward
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
how it does that is really providing a
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
structured framework from which they can
 
02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
we can optimize the achievements of
 
02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:39.469 align:start position:0%
we can optimize the achievements of
those

02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
goals to so to do that we have some key
 
02:27:45.070 --> 02:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
metrics that we sort of we track and
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see on a graph there over the
 
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
last 6 months we we have a gradual
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
increase so project management is a huge
 
02:27:55.230 --> 02:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
culture shift in any organization that
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
hasn't had it over the last six years um
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
I know I've been I've had conversations
 
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
with the chair about being able to have
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
better project management in our
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
organization as well as members of many
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
of many committees in the the
 
02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
legislature our goal is to continuously
 
02:28:16.030 --> 02:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
improve and you'll hear that as a theme
 
02:28:18.429 --> 02:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
even in contracts where they use the
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
lean Six Sigma um process which is very
 
02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
similar to Agile um project
 
02:28:28.110 --> 02:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
management but here are some metrics we
 
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
in the last year we completed 106
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
projects we have currently 104 open over
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
the last two years we've been averaging
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
about 200 projects a year going through
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
the pmo office now that doesn't mean
 
02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
every project is in there there's lots
 
02:28:46.030 --> 02:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
of projects that are moving forward
 
02:28:48.750 --> 02:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
outside of the pmo because they they
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
were either quick fix
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
like quick Solutions like 6 weeks or
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
less or they didn't have um a large
 
02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
resource complement and in some cases
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
they weren't identified as a project man
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
a project that needed to be
 
02:29:09.269 --> 02:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
managed we then trained over 284 people
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
at this point in the three-day training
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
so Mr weers are are you are you telling
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
us that the project management office is
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
embedded in the it office in a way in
 
02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
which if the project is some sort of a
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
clinical roll out of a new program it's
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
still coming through the it
 
02:29:30.910 --> 02:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
pmo I I'm just curious about your
 
02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:32.349 align:start position:0%
pmo I I'm just curious about your
organizational

02:29:32.349 --> 02:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
organizational
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
structure um I would the only correction
 
02:29:36.670 --> 02:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
I would say is it's the information
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
Services Group so we look at the
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
information Services is really not just
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
technology it's all information and so
 
02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes it is embedded in the information
 
02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
Services team outstanding thank
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
you and then we
 
02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
in order to adopt a change in any
 
02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
organizations you can't just train the
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
workers that do the work you have to
 
02:29:57.790 --> 02:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
also train the leaders that are
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
sponsoring and supporting the work if
 
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
the people that are driving the ship
 
02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how the ship is to move
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
forward and go backwards and and dock
 
02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to do those
 
02:30:10.269 --> 02:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
basic functions so we went through and
 
02:30:13.389 --> 02:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
trained 75 of our DHHS leaders in a
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
one-day training in order to give them
 
02:30:18.510 --> 02:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
the overview of how we can move this
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
forward and this is leadership at
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
multiple levels within the department so
 
02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
that they have the tools that they need
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
to work with their teams to be most
 
02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
effective as you I'm a little slow on
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
the uptake I so I have a followup to the
 
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
pmo question so not everyone who
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
performs pmo functions works for the IT
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
department I assume you're taking on a
 
02:30:47.309 --> 02:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
matrix basis people from the
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
organization making sure they have PM
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
skill that they're using the pmo
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
functions and and forms and but they're
 
02:30:57.469 --> 02:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
still continuing to work where they
 
02:30:59.950 --> 02:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
normally work you are absolutely correct
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
I could not have said it better okay
 
02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
because that would be a lot of people
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
that would be a lot of people the pmo
 
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
itself is five people okay good
 
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
thanks so then moving on to slide six
 
02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
because that's essentially the role of
 
02:31:17.230 --> 02:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
the pmo is to provide that guidance
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
provide that leadership to the rest of
 
02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
the organizations so that they can adopt
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
those those best
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
practices I have a quick question before
 
02:31:27.269 --> 02:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
you move
 
02:31:27.279 --> 02:31:33.389 align:start position:0%
you move
past

02:31:33.389 --> 02:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:38.670 --> 02:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
oh okay uh on the I uh don't want to go
 
02:31:40.510 --> 02:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of detail but I'm looking at the
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
metrics that were on uh the chart with
 
02:31:45.269 --> 02:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
the metrics and maybe just pick a couple
 
02:31:48.150 --> 02:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
and and say what those are and uh what
 
02:31:50.510 --> 02:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're measuring certainly thank you
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
for the question so the the key metrics
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for is to make sure
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
that people are updating their schedules
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
so you'll see in Orange there's a how
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
many projects have at least 25 tasks and
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
so the goal is to try to see how often
 
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
what the the adoption is of the pmo
 
02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
process another risk is another metric
 
02:32:17.230 --> 02:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
is looking at risk metric metrics how
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
many risks have been identified
 
02:32:21.550 --> 02:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
associated with being able to achieve
 
02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
the goal of the project are we
 
02:32:26.469 --> 02:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
identifying those risks mitigating those
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
risks and then coming up with a way in
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
which to move forward and then one of
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
the ones that actually is pro proven to
 
02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
be really effective for our our teams is
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
have does the project have a charter so
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
a project Charter is like a precursor to
 
02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
a business case in the in the private
 
02:32:47.269 --> 02:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
sector it's a document that goes over
 
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
your scope it identifies the resources
 
02:32:52.190 --> 02:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
that you need identifies what success
 
02:32:54.910 --> 02:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
looks like and in many cases it
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
identifies the funding you need to be
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
able to be successful how are you going
 
02:33:00.670 --> 02:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to support this solution both
 
02:33:03.070 --> 02:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
in the implementation as well as um
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance and operations and
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
then with that it allows the project
 
02:33:11.469 --> 02:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
team to identify who's the core of the
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
team who's the sponsor who's the project
 
02:33:16.030 --> 02:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
manager who are the team members and
 
02:33:19.389 --> 02:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
gets that cohesive team um teaming that
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
you need in order to achieve goals
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
without a project Charter many projects
 
02:33:26.349 --> 02:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
tend to go many different directions
 
02:33:28.269 --> 02:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
because they don't know what they're
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve the goal that that
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
again going back to tracking that allows
 
02:33:35.469 --> 02:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
us to know these projects are going to
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
be healthier as a result of having a
 
02:33:40.750 --> 02:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
charter healthier as a result of having
 
02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
tasks identified in their project
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
schedule and healthier because they
 
02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
identified a risk and had a risk
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan to address those risks
 
02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:51.309 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan to address those risks
thank

02:33:51.309 --> 02:33:51.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
you and the and the context of this is
 
02:33:56.670 --> 02:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
that if we were to flash back six years
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
ago or so there there was no pmo
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
function was there and and this is
 
02:34:03.150 --> 02:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
something that's been established and
 
02:34:05.309 --> 02:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
rolled out and is continuing to be
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
developed or or have we always had a a
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
pmo function we've had a project
 
02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
management function however the office
 
02:34:15.389 --> 02:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
before was a team of four or five people
 
02:34:17.150 --> 02:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
that would be assigned to critical
 
02:34:19.950 --> 02:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
projects and they were a team of project
 
02:34:21.870 --> 02:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
managers that had gone through
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
certification and could lead those big
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
Enterprise projects forward but we never
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
really implemented best practices in a
 
02:34:30.750 --> 02:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
process for which the rest of the
 
02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
department could adopt and learn and be
 
02:34:35.790 --> 02:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
able to achieve those goals in concert
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
not just the four or five projects or
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 that the the five people that
 
02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
were're running so we've expanded it to
 
02:34:44.830 --> 02:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
more of a best practices center of
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
excellence and and Leadership across the
 
02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
department versus a Staffing um Bureau
 
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
you so this is your fa favorite part Mr
 
02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
chair you asked about systems so here's
 
02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
some of the systems that we were talking
 
02:35:05.469 --> 02:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
about and I was trying to give a sort of
 
02:35:08.110 --> 02:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
a diagram and this may or may not help
 
02:35:11.790 --> 02:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
you visualize how information moves be
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
be around the system so think of
 
02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
yourself as that
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
one person in the center there that has
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
the application below them and then
 
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
SharePoint teams Office 365 and Jour
 
02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
above them if that one person wants to
 
02:35:29.550 --> 02:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
share information with multiple people
 
02:35:31.950 --> 02:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
within the the department or multiple
 
02:35:35.230 --> 02:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
people across the state they would be
 
02:35:39.070 --> 02:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
able to or even with providers and other
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
contractors that are authorized through
 
02:35:43.230 --> 02:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
our Contracting process they would be
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
able to use SharePoint teams our Office
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
365 and Azure active directory for that
 
02:35:52.110 --> 02:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
that sharing methodology that is all
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
managed by dyt for us but is a critical
 
02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
component of our budget that you'll see
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
is a there's a transfer to doit is
 
02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
called class 27 and that's a critical
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
component for us to be able to achieve
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
these efficiencies of communication and
 
02:36:09.269 --> 02:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
collaboration amongst our team members
 
02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
amongst our different departments within
 
02:36:14.429 --> 02:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
the state and also with our providers
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
that we work
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
with now that same person will be
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
accessing many applications and you'll I
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
I listed some applications below there
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
from their computer they would go to a
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
Salesforce or the new heights integrated
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility system or Medicaid
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
enterprise system and and so forth and
 
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
so on they would log into those systems
 
02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
more often than not their web-based
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
cloud-based solutions that they would
 
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
then access that
 
02:36:46.990 --> 02:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
information those systems will connect
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
in the back on through interfaces secure
 
02:36:52.990 --> 02:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
interfaces to other components to store
 
02:36:55.269 --> 02:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
data in onbase for document Management
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
in many cases and retention and to do
 
02:37:02.429 --> 02:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
data analytics and to do Trend M Trend
 
02:37:04.429 --> 02:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
management and Reporting in Enterprise
 
02:37:04.439 --> 02:37:05.830 align:start position:0%
management and Reporting in Enterprise
business

02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
intelligence yes Mr chair sorry no no no
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing great I I just want to do
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
an application of all of this modeling
 
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
to see if I understand how it works the
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
other the other day um we had had um
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
Miss santanella and uh Tilly in here
 
02:37:29.150 --> 02:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
updating us on um a new kaizon project
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
that they had worked to develop
 
02:37:33.389 --> 02:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
streamlined processes that cross
 
02:37:36.030 --> 02:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
multiple departments and they're gaining
 
02:37:38.429 --> 02:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
great efficiency out of it and I asked
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
the question is is helping you with any
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the new workflow because it their
 
02:37:48.269 --> 02:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
process relied on a new workflow with
 
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
new information flow
 
02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
and and I I I I don't think I was
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
speaking their language they couldn't
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
they didn't address it exactly so so I'm
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
asking you do do you have like a
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
workflow component when somebody does
 
02:38:04.030 --> 02:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
come up with a new efficient process
 
02:38:06.389 --> 02:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
you're able to adjust so that the
 
02:38:09.070 --> 02:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
Systems Support the new workflow or are
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
they still doing work around manual uh
 
02:38:15.269 --> 02:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
fixes when they come up with new
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
processes the honest answer is sometimes
 
02:38:21.150 --> 02:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
both um it depends on funding and um
 
02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
time so in many cases like I was
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
explaining the integrated eligibility
 
02:38:28.110 --> 02:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
system we are doing studies with our
 
02:38:31.269 --> 02:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
vendor to identify efficiencies and do
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
that workflow work in other cases if
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
something comes from um state or federal
 
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and doesn't have the time or
 
02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
the funding many cases we will need to
 
02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
do a manual work around to achieve that
 
02:38:48.269 --> 02:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
goal so it it's hard to answer I can I
 
02:38:50.830 --> 02:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
will reach back out to Chris selo and
 
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
and trishy to identify what they were
 
02:38:55.389 --> 02:38:55.399 align:start position:0%
speaking to you about and see how we can
 
02:38:56.990 --> 02:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
translate that for you all right so it
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like I had a bad assumption that
 
02:39:02.110 --> 02:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
Salesforce was a sort of a universal
 
02:39:08.110 --> 02:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.510 --> 02:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
management I hear what you're saying and
 
02:39:14.110 --> 02:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
it is but it's not necessarily as rapid
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
as we would like and so it does take
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
time and in many cases because we have
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
procurement practices we have a master
 
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
Services agreement that we have to go
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
out for RFQ and that that time frame
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes results and manual workarounds
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
right so so if people are wondering why
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
I'm asking these these particular kind
 
02:39:36.510 --> 02:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
of questions it's because um we're we're
 
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to continually have pressures to
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
do more with less and I see it as as
 
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully a silver bullet and the
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
ability for us to adjust and support new
 
02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:49.469 align:start position:0%
ability for us to adjust and support new
workflows

02:39:49.469 --> 02:39:49.479 align:start position:0%
workflows
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh in a more Dynamic basis as as part of
 
02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
what we're going to need for future
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
coping skills and you and I have talked
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
about it off and on but but it's it's
 
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
getting to be imperative that we use it
 
02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
as a more of a strategic tool to do more
 
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
with less 100% agree and I think just
 
02:40:15.309 --> 02:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
one thing to add and you you did this in
 
02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
the last session in many of the bills of
 
02:40:20.670 --> 02:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
having the effective dates of the bills
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
allow for that it um integration allows
 
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
for the time necessary to implement when
 
02:40:29.469 --> 02:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
the sometimes when we get bills either
 
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
from the federal or or state that says
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
effective July 1st and it goes through
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
the session we don't have enough time to
 
02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
build the technology so that results in
 
02:40:41.950 --> 02:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
manual workarounds and once a manual
 
02:40:45.150 --> 02:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
workarounds in place it's really
 
02:40:48.269 --> 02:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
difficult for providers and communities
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
to want to stop
 
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
the process and then Implement a
 
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
technology solution so that that there's
 
02:40:56.190 --> 02:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
two things that are in concert is
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes in order to implement
 
02:40:59.710 --> 02:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
Technology Solutions we need more time
 
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
to do so and it's not just money so we
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
do have Salesforce um licensing that we
 
02:41:08.269 --> 02:41:08.279 align:start position:0%
can design Solutions we just would need
 
02:41:10.030 --> 02:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
some time to do
 
02:41:15.550 --> 02:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
those Mr chairman a question so um a
 
02:41:17.309 --> 02:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
general question what kind of Provisions
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
do we have for like catastrophic
 
02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
recovery of of data and information and
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
backup very good question thank you um
 
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
so each each contract that we go through
 
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
has a number of documents that they're
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
required to provide one of them is a
 
02:41:36.389 --> 02:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
Disaster Recovery Solution as well as
 
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
well as business continuity planning so
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
when we go to the cloud um most of those
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
systems are redundant in many ways so
 
02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
they're redundant in the sense that
 
02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
their server fails it fails over to
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
another server and it's up and running
 
02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:49.830 align:start position:0%
another server and it's up and running
Within

02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
Within
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
milliseconds um they're also required to
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
back up the data um in in such a way
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
that it could be restored it used to be
 
02:42:00.510 --> 02:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
um back in my day as a technical person
 
02:42:03.269 --> 02:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
backup to tape it's now more back up to
 
02:42:04.830 --> 02:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
hard drive and so they take the hard
 
02:42:06.269 --> 02:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
drives and they put them in a different
 
02:42:09.070 --> 02:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
location and the other ways that we do
 
02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
in some of our more critical systems is
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
we have replicated Solutions in
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
different data centers or different
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
components of the cloud hosting provider
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the services that
 
02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
are being rendered the the amount of
 
02:42:25.630 --> 02:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
funding that we have to support it cuz
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
disaster recovery and continuity
 
02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
planning the the better you get at it
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
the more expensive it gets and the and
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
so we do have a plan for every it system
 
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to restore um and be able to
 
02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
bring the systems back up and running
 
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
and we have Coupe planning within all of
 
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
our programs to address those when we
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:53.950 --> 02:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
so that really takes us to slide
 
02:42:56.510 --> 02:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
seven and this is where I'm going to I'm
 
02:42:58.230 --> 02:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
going to try to walk you through and I
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
know we're about 40 minutes in so I want
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have time and I
 
02:43:05.309 --> 02:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you hit your 3:00 time
 
02:43:07.389 --> 02:43:07.399 align:start position:0%
frame so I'm going to try to go through
 
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
this certainly have any questions I want
 
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
to answer them if I can but as you heard
 
02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
the other day from the commissioner we
 
02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
have three different commitment areas
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
and each of those commitment areas do r
 
02:43:22.269 --> 02:43:22.279 align:start position:0%
r on technology to in order to implement
 
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
them in various ways so starting with
 
02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
invest in people and culture so that
 
02:43:30.429 --> 02:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
invest in people and culture um
 
02:43:32.510 --> 02:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
initiative or commitment is really
 
02:43:36.030 --> 02:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
focusing on our Workforce as a whole and
 
02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we can hear what their
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
what their issues are how do we address
 
02:43:43.950 --> 02:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
operational effectiveness how can we do
 
02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
more with less as you said Mr chair and
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
through that information where we went
 
02:43:52.429 --> 02:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
out on road trips um to different
 
02:43:54.030 --> 02:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
facilities the commissioner went out
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
with on road trips with members of our
 
02:43:58.590 --> 02:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
leadership team as well as doing all
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
staff meetings to really pull in that
 
02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
information from our Workforce that is
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
distributed across the the state of New
 
02:44:09.429 --> 02:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we we identified a couple
 
02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
Technology Solutions that could help us
 
02:44:13.389 --> 02:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
move components of that in that
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
commitment forward one of them was for
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention so we've been
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
partnering with the administrative
 
02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:19.990 align:start position:0%
partnering with the administrative
service

02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
on Statewide contracts with LinkedIn and
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
indeed as well as we post all of our
 
02:44:28.429 --> 02:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
positions on New Hampshire first over
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
the last year we've actually seen um
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
really effective results from our indeed
 
02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
contract as well as um continued
 
02:44:38.429 --> 02:44:38.439 align:start position:0%
effective recruitment through New
 
02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first our LinkedIn was slow to
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
roll up and I think that's primarily
 
02:44:47.309 --> 02:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
because DHHS doesn't recruit a lot of
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
technologists and a lot of people on
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn were F first people on LinkedIn
 
02:44:54.269 --> 02:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
were technologists it has grown to a
 
02:44:56.830 --> 02:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
much larger population over the last
 
02:45:00.150 --> 02:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
decade however indeed really seemed to
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
reach out to where they were going so
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at those contracts looking
 
02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
at their metrics to see how we can
 
02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
squeeze more out of them and and
 
02:45:12.990 --> 02:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
leverage that it also gave us some
 
02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
insight into why do people why do people
 
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
leave organizations and we've all heard
 
02:45:20.469 --> 02:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
lots of different reasons why people
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
leave organizations it's not always
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
money most of the time it's culture what
 
02:45:27.230 --> 02:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
does that mean by culture how is your
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
supervisor does your
 
02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
supervisor rule with an iron fist or do
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
they rule really LAX desically there's
 
02:45:36.190 --> 02:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
lots of different ways to interpret
 
02:45:38.070 --> 02:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
culture and I'll move forward through
 
02:45:41.469 --> 02:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
there um but the the safety culture was
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
the other component so with the the
 
02:45:46.349 --> 02:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
event at New Hampshire hospital
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
occurring we actually partner with
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
Homeland security and Emergency
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
Management to perform physical security
 
02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
assessments and we've performed those
 
02:45:57.790 --> 02:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
tool those assessments across all of our
 
02:45:59.870 --> 02:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
district offices and we be continuing
 
02:46:02.950 --> 02:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
through the remaining of our sites at
 
02:46:06.510 --> 02:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
our um in our that we occupy here on the
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
state office complex over on Pleasant
 
02:46:12.269 --> 02:46:12.279 align:start position:0%
Street as well as Hazen Drive the key
 
02:46:14.269 --> 02:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
things that are coming out of there is
 
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities to look at how are we
 
02:46:19.550 --> 02:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
utilizing our technology our bad access
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
systems um one of the big things that we
 
02:46:24.269 --> 02:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
did is like everyone needs to badge in
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
and we try to normalize it and say hey
 
02:46:28.510 --> 02:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
when you're badging in ask the person
 
02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
behind you to badge in as well it's it's
 
02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
not a bad thing you're not being rude or
 
02:46:34.590 --> 02:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
anything like that we're trying to
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
normalize it to be just a normal process
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
and if you're visiting you'll get a
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
visitor's badge um so if you ever come
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
to one of our depart our locations and
 
02:46:47.429 --> 02:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
we ask you to sign in don't think um
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to single you out
 
02:46:51.070 --> 02:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do that to everyone
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's coming in the other one is vid
 
02:46:53.359 --> 02:46:54.269 align:start position:0%
that's coming in the other one is vid
video

02:46:54.269 --> 02:46:54.279 align:start position:0%
video
 
02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance and so ensuring that we
 
02:46:58.469 --> 02:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
have a consistent process for video
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
surveillance all of these
 
02:47:03.870 --> 02:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
are have impacts on our budget so that's
 
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
why I'm bringing them up here those are
 
02:47:07.630 --> 02:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
the monetary impacts that you'll see in
 
02:47:09.910 --> 02:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
different budget numbers and you'll see
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
that sometimes we cut those and say we
 
02:47:14.830 --> 02:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily need that standard
 
02:47:16.750 --> 02:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
today because we have something in place
 
02:47:19.070 --> 02:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
today and we'll be able to look at it in
 
02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:20.590 align:start position:0%
today and we'll be able to look at it in
the

02:47:20.590 --> 02:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:23.469 --> 02:47:23.479 align:start position:0%
future so then moving over to the
 
02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
promote thriving communities and that's
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
the one on the right on purple this is
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
again where we were talking about
 
02:47:33.030 --> 02:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
different initiatives we're going to
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
leverage some of our different
 
02:47:36.030 --> 02:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
Technologies including the New Hampshire
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
Care Connections where it is integrated
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
with our um some some of our waivers as
 
02:47:44.389 --> 02:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
well as our different services within
 
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
our department to make referrals do ped
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
bed tracking maintain assessments um as
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
well as M ma manage emissions discharge
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
and transfers between Healthcare facil
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and have shared care insights
 
02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
when and this is a key component that I
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure when the the patient
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
has provided consent so we're not doing
 
02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't consent to be part of
 
02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
the network they would still receive
 
02:48:13.590 --> 02:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
Services they just wouldn't receive
 
02:48:16.990 --> 02:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
system the next one is docy sign so
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
we've been using docy sign with contract
 
02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
contract management for many years now
 
02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it's been very effective at reducing
 
02:48:30.269 --> 02:48:30.279 align:start position:0%
the time at which to get signatures on
 
02:48:33.630 --> 02:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
contracts it sounds silly but we spent
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
many days tracking people down to get
 
02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
signatures on a contract that we really
 
02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
needed to move forward and that resulted
 
02:48:44.309 --> 02:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
in prod productivity loss we took that a
 
02:48:47.309 --> 02:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
Next Level to manage consent Management
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
in many of our programs so the lead
 
02:48:51.870 --> 02:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
program was one of the most recent ones
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
to add docy sign but we use it across
 
02:48:56.190 --> 02:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
our department um both in long-term
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
Support Services Public Health and our
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
contracts group and I believe we're
 
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to be expanding it into other
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
areas as well to really improve
 
02:49:09.070 --> 02:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
productivity and and ensure that we do
 
02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
get that consent with a standard-based
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
approach the next ones are excel at Food
 
02:49:17.630 --> 02:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
protection we've been working on this
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
contract for a while we've been working
 
02:49:22.229 --> 02:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
with Exel for food production and all of
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
us that go out to eat rely on this
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
system and this program area because
 
02:49:29.469 --> 02:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that keep us safe
 
02:49:31.710 --> 02:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
Trisha Tilly does a much better job at
 
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
talking about it but I can tell you
 
02:49:35.710 --> 02:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
without food protection we would have a
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
lot of interesting Foods being served to
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
us um at the restaurants that we go to
 
02:49:42.670 --> 02:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
in the grocery stores we go so this is a
 
02:49:44.309 --> 02:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
key component that we're moving forward
 
02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
on that initiative and that and then
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
moving into
 
02:49:51.790 --> 02:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see I'm I go through different
 
02:49:54.469 --> 02:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
systems again asell is a cloud-based
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
solution um docy sign is cloudbased and
 
02:49:58.910 --> 02:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Care Connections
 
02:50:00.910 --> 02:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
they're all cloud-based Solutions and
 
02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't catch that earlier I'll
 
02:50:06.229 --> 02:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
try to make sure I I go through them the
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
Drupal web content management system is
 
02:50:11.710 --> 02:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
also a cloud-based solution that was
 
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
implemented by
 
02:50:15.870 --> 02:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
do and that allowed for our department
 
02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
to more effectively re-engineer near our
 
02:50:21.790 --> 02:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
website in more of a client Centric or
 
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
provider Centric way before it was much
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
more focused on how we operate and not
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
how people consume our services and
 
02:50:33.510 --> 02:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're constantly endeavoring to make it
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
easier for people to utilize our
 
02:50:37.870 --> 02:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
services understand what the services
 
02:50:41.229 --> 02:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
are understand what um the
 
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
different um technologies that we have
 
02:50:46.349 --> 02:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
available to them or services that are
 
02:50:49.229 --> 02:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
available to them the last three
 
02:50:51.710 --> 02:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
um in I'll go into a little bit more
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
detail in future slides our new heights
 
02:50:55.870 --> 02:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire easy and that's our
 
02:50:58.469 --> 02:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility system we have an
 
02:51:01.630 --> 02:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
initiative focused on how do we be more
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
efficient with that system to provide
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
efficiencies to the staff so again doing
 
02:51:08.910 --> 02:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
more with less where we can that's
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
primarily because we have a higher
 
02:51:13.110 --> 02:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
attrition rate in or not not attrition
 
02:51:16.110 --> 02:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
rate high vacancy rate in the Bureau of
 
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
family assistance that utilizes this
 
02:51:20.389 --> 02:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
system in the call center and we we're
 
02:51:22.830 --> 02:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
trying to relook at that and see how we
 
02:51:25.630 --> 02:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
can utilize a system to help that
 
02:51:28.710 --> 02:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
Workforce and then the Medicaid
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
enterprise system is also as part of
 
02:51:33.389 --> 02:51:33.399 align:start position:0%
promoting thriving communities and we'll
 
02:51:35.510 --> 02:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
talk really in detail in the slide here
 
02:51:37.750 --> 02:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
and and then the laboratory information
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
management system which is used in
 
02:51:42.990 --> 02:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
public health to provide specimen
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
receipt analysis and reporting of all
 
02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
lab testing that goes through our Public
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
Health lab
 
02:51:51.389 --> 02:51:51.399 align:start position:0%
so a lot of people don't know about it I
 
02:51:52.950 --> 02:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
haven't actually had a chance to visit
 
02:51:55.550 --> 02:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
the whole thing but it's a really from
 
02:51:57.389 --> 02:51:57.399 align:start position:0%
the outside it looks amazing and Ian
 
02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
keeps promising me that he's going to
 
02:52:00.349 --> 02:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
take me on a
 
02:52:00.359 --> 02:52:01.990 align:start position:0%
take me on a
tour

02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
tour
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
someday um and then improving customer
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
service being our last commitment
 
02:52:10.229 --> 02:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
um there again you'll see the new
 
02:52:12.309 --> 02:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
heights and New Hampshire easy the
 
02:52:14.510 --> 02:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
reason why that's in there for improving
 
02:52:17.309 --> 02:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
customer service is that is where anyone
 
02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
that wants to en enroll or get
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility for SNAP tanif Medicaid and
 
02:52:24.990 --> 02:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
other services they go to New Hampshire
 
02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
easy make their application and then it
 
02:52:28.990 --> 02:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
gets managed through New Heights on the
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
back end you see docu docy sign is
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
another component of the improving
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
customer service for contract management
 
02:52:38.110 --> 02:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
and as as we continue to evolve that
 
02:52:41.190 --> 02:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
work and then on base as we talked about
 
02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
earlier for data classification and data
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
retention so um I'm I'm going to ask you
 
02:52:51.150 --> 02:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
to keep the comments on the uh Medicaid
 
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
system to kind of more of the um profile
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the system rather than what it does
 
02:52:58.670 --> 02:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
because we can read what it does it
 
02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
manages Medicaid um the uh is this a
 
02:53:06.229 --> 02:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
stable system um what sort of end to
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
life issues are we looking at I think
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is the most expensive system we
 
02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
have um do we have any uh vital uh
 
02:53:17.269 --> 02:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
interfaces that are due up to to make
 
02:53:20.030 --> 02:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
the system more practical do we have any
 
02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
additional modifications or or modules
 
02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
that we need to buy in order to adapt to
 
02:53:28.830 --> 02:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
new capability we're that we're required
 
02:53:30.670 --> 02:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
to have I I don't need to know what the
 
02:53:33.229 --> 02:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
system does as much as where we're going
 
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
and what the what the impact on on the
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
on the money may
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
be thank you Mr chair I will address the
 
02:53:43.070 --> 02:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
slide eight in that way because there is
 
02:53:44.590 --> 02:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of information for Medicaid
 
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
enterprise system so your first question
 
02:53:50.229 --> 02:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
was is the system stable the current
 
02:53:51.710 --> 02:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
system is the Medicaid management
 
02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
information system yes the system is
 
02:53:57.229 --> 02:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
stable it doesn't provide um a lot it
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
has a number of pain points that has
 
02:54:02.030 --> 02:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
resulted in delivery of services being
 
02:54:04.110 --> 02:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
delayed one of them being provider
 
02:54:07.950 --> 02:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
management um enrollment can take a long
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
time because of the way it was designed
 
02:54:15.469 --> 02:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
back in 2005 and subsequently upgraded
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
caused some challenges for us to be able
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
to Pivot so in terms of end of life it
 
02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
is a system that is 10 20 years old it
 
02:54:27.870 --> 02:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
was it was deemed end of life um 5 years
 
02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
ago and we embarked on a 10-year um
 
02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
replacement plan we leveraged um center
 
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
for Medicare Medica Medicaid services
 
02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:40.279 align:start position:0%
strategies for modular reprocurement and
 
02:54:42.349 --> 02:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
we're about halfway through um that
 
02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and we've implemented a
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
number of solutions and we have Capital
 
02:54:49.070 --> 02:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
funding to implement a number more to
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
answer one of your other questions is
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
how does this impact our budget um this
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
coming session for the the next bium
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's two key key areas every time you
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
expend Capital you have a maintenance
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
and operations cost so we're
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
implementing Solutions like system
 
02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
integrator which is really gold at
 
02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
bringing all of our systems together
 
02:55:12.990 --> 02:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
effectively making sure that those
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
interfaces that you were talking about
 
02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
that are our end of life are replaced
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
with standard um interfaces like smart
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
on fire or hl7 messaging or other es
 
02:55:27.309 --> 02:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
other types of API strategies as opposed
 
02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
to Flat files that are being exported
 
02:55:31.870 --> 02:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
from one system and imported to another
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
that can cause errors in the actual
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
communication the so you'll see an
 
02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
increased operational cost for the
 
02:55:44.110 --> 02:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program in order to support the
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
systems that are coming online however
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
we did um look at how could we address
 
02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
um reducing some of those costs by
 
02:55:56.309 --> 02:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
delaying or I would say leveraging the
 
02:55:58.229 --> 02:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
design development and implementation
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
period that the federal government gives
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
us a 90% Federal match um federal
 
02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
financial participation dollar match for
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
and so we reduced the impact on next
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
next bium or we're looking to reduce the
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
next the impact on the next Bion by
 
02:56:19.630 --> 02:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
doing those types of that type of work
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
um but the there's also a capital
 
02:56:26.030 --> 02:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
project that has been submitted and
 
02:56:28.389 --> 02:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
would be reviewed by the the Public
 
02:56:31.590 --> 02:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
Works committee that would be necessary
 
02:56:33.710 --> 02:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
to continue the Medicaid enterprise
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
system um 10year plan so it's really a
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
two things and so the way I look at
 
02:56:41.110 --> 02:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
everything in technology is a capital
 
02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure and an operational
 
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure house division 3 talks about
 
02:56:48.429 --> 02:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
operational expenditures but the Public
 
02:56:50.110 --> 02:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
Works committee talks about the capital
 
02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures but all those Capital
 
02:56:56.070 --> 02:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
expenditures impact the operational
 
02:56:57.910 --> 02:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures in house division 3 so
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's trying to make sure that when I
 
02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
talk about those I don't confuse you
 
02:57:03.710 --> 02:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
because they won't be in your budget but
 
02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
they will have an impact over
 
02:57:11.229 --> 02:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
time um so that that Capital um project
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm not supposed to talk
 
02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
about numbers but it's out there is
 
02:57:18.469 --> 02:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
$33,750 th000 and it's to support third
 
02:57:18.479 --> 02:57:20.389 align:start position:0%
$33,750 th000 and it's to support third
party

02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:57:23.389 --> 02:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
liability it's it's it's not um part of
 
02:57:25.389 --> 02:57:25.399 align:start position:0%
the it's it's part of something that's
 
02:57:26.429 --> 02:57:26.439 align:start position:0%
already been
 
02:57:29.070 --> 02:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
published um so I didn't say anything
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
about the governor's budget I don't
 
02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
believe but maybe I did I
 
02:57:36.389 --> 02:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
apologize um but that capital submitt is
 
02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
in your Mees bundles list in that aqua
 
02:57:41.630 --> 02:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
color towards the bottom third party
 
02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
liability call center and member
 
02:57:46.429 --> 02:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
management those are three critical
 
02:57:48.750 --> 02:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
components of the Medicaid enterprise
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
system but each one of the components
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
builds upon itself so we currently do
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
third party liability through our
 
02:57:58.790 --> 02:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
02:58:01.309 --> 02:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
but it has not met the needs of our
 
02:58:03.630 --> 02:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
program quality and integrity group to
 
02:58:06.269 --> 02:58:06.279 align:start position:0%
be able to do it effectively and it and
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
it essentially
 
02:58:11.070 --> 02:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't work as well as it's supposed to
 
02:58:12.870 --> 02:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the call center management
 
02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
solution doesn't it's not a single call
 
02:58:17.349 --> 02:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
center we have multiple call centers so
 
02:58:19.429 --> 02:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
we have play people going to multiple
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
different places to get Services which
 
02:58:23.990 --> 02:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
is not an effective use of call center
 
02:58:25.950 --> 02:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
time it's not an effective use of client
 
02:58:28.750 --> 02:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
time and it actually costs more money to
 
02:58:31.469 --> 02:58:31.479 align:start position:0%
the state to manage it that way so so if
 
02:58:34.309 --> 02:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
you were to replay this video the the
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
last four or five minutes is more of
 
02:58:38.990 --> 02:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
what I was hoping to get from you
 
02:58:41.870 --> 02:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
throughout this presentation than sort
 
02:58:44.269 --> 02:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
of the initial functionality
 
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
conversation okay cuz we we're having
 
02:58:49.550 --> 02:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
Department heads and all tell us about
 
02:58:51.710 --> 02:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
the the functionality of what they do in
 
02:58:54.070 --> 02:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
their Department what I was what I was
 
02:58:56.349 --> 02:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
hoping to get and your Medicaid
 
02:58:59.790 --> 02:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
description was excellent is a sense of
 
02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
how stable are our platforms what what
 
02:59:03.790 --> 02:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
are the issues that we're having how
 
02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to expand capability
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
um so so that that that was great if you
 
02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
if you can kind of continue on that
 
02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
theme on the next it systems and I
 
02:59:16.630 --> 02:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
believe representative Mooney has a
 
02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:18.710 align:start position:0%
believe representative Mooney has a
question

02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:59:20.590 --> 02:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you both
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
for being here uh this is a very
 
02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
detailed and thorough subject and I
 
02:59:26.790 --> 02:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the time you put into
 
02:59:29.670 --> 02:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
presenting and preparing the capital
 
02:59:33.469 --> 02:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
budget overseen by public works just to
 
02:59:38.389 --> 02:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
reiterate $33 million of that budget
 
02:59:42.550 --> 02:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
actually is part of your
 
02:59:45.790 --> 02:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
department is that included in what
 
02:59:49.429 --> 02:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
you're presenting to house finance or
 
02:59:52.469 --> 02:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
separate thank you thank you for the
 
02:59:55.070 --> 02:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
question representative Mooney um Dave
 
02:59:58.190 --> 02:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
was referring to House Bill 25
 
03:00:00.269 --> 03:00:00.279 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from past legislative
 
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
sessions so that's not part of our
 
03:00:04.349 --> 03:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
budget that's the the capital budget
 
03:00:06.830 --> 03:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
process works um generally speaking it's
 
03:00:09.389 --> 03:00:09.399 align:start position:0%
on a six-year basis so an appropriation
 
03:00:10.429 --> 03:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
is made in
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
hb25 and then two years later it's
 
03:00:15.630 --> 03:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
looked at and say you know are the funds
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
expended is the project still ongoing
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then and then those funds are um
 
03:00:22.030 --> 03:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
continued into the prior banum as far as
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
the authority to continue to spend those
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
so the numbers that Dave was referring
 
03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
to is not in our operating budget it's
 
03:00:28.710 --> 03:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
in Prior
 
03:00:32.110 --> 03:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:39.630 --> 03:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
you so continuing in that vein of trying
 
03:00:42.309 --> 03:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
to go through I'm going to go to slide
 
03:00:44.950 --> 03:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
nine on economic
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
stability as a results for those
 
03:00:50.349 --> 03:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
questions so Nexus and New Heights are
 
03:00:52.750 --> 03:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
both stable systems um Nexus is a
 
03:00:56.750 --> 03:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
certified solution um with um with with
 
03:00:58.269 --> 03:00:58.279 align:start position:0%
our different Federal
 
03:01:00.469 --> 03:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
providers however there is some areas
 
03:01:03.349 --> 03:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we'd like that we are looking to um
 
03:01:05.349 --> 03:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
upgrade and primarily it's the data
 
03:01:08.590 --> 03:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
analytics and Reporting where the the
 
03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
hardware the Oracle hard the servers and
 
03:01:14.110 --> 03:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
the Oracle licensing is an end of life
 
03:01:17.710 --> 03:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
and so we are looking to identify how we
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
can move that forward um so you'll see
 
03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
you may see that in the future budget in
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
terms of how do we
 
03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
achieve ongoing life cycle replacement
 
03:01:30.910 --> 03:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
of Hardware the servers and so this is
 
03:01:34.630 --> 03:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
um representative Neno us for what are
 
03:01:36.190 --> 03:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
on premise this is an on premise
 
03:01:38.269 --> 03:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
solution Nexus is not a cloud-based
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
solution and so it is dependent upon a
 
03:01:44.229 --> 03:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
partnership with dit where we need to
 
03:01:45.630 --> 03:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
maintain the hardware maintain the
 
03:01:48.469 --> 03:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
software and upgrade it on a period of
 
03:01:51.070 --> 03:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
usually 5 to 10 years depending on the
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
vendors so in in terms of Oracle they've
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
they basically put end of support end of
 
03:01:59.950 --> 03:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
life on some of their products so we
 
03:02:01.870 --> 03:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
actually have to upgrade it to make sure
 
03:02:03.510 --> 03:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
and we're in the process of doing that
 
03:02:06.229 --> 03:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
right now and then the hardware itself
 
03:02:08.910 --> 03:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
goes end of life over a period of right
 
03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
I think the do sets the end of life
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
period it's usually between 6 and 10
 
03:02:15.670 --> 03:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
years based off of failure
 
03:02:18.870 --> 03:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
rates and so there are some of those
 
03:02:21.190 --> 03:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
areas that we're going to be focusing on
 
03:02:23.670 --> 03:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
and then one of the things I just want
 
03:02:25.630 --> 03:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure and I'm not going to read
 
03:02:27.990 --> 03:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
it but call attention to the interfaces
 
03:02:30.030 --> 03:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of our systems interface with each
 
03:02:32.229 --> 03:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
other across the department so they
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't work on them on their own they
 
03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
they provide a key key function for the
 
03:02:40.110 --> 03:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
program but they leverage other
 
03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
Enterprise architecture to achieve
 
03:02:45.630 --> 03:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
claims processing or other types of of
 
03:02:47.630 --> 03:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
work and that the reason why we do that
 
03:02:49.469 --> 03:02:49.479 align:start position:0%
is so that we don't have to implement
 
03:02:51.309 --> 03:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
multiple of those
 
03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
Solutions so a question about that are
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
are these all onetoone interfaces or do
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
you have an interface engine that you
 
03:03:02.670 --> 03:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
can tie everything to so that's a good
 
03:03:04.790 --> 03:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
question that would go back to slide
 
03:03:07.389 --> 03:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
eight um we don't have a we don't have
 
03:03:09.510 --> 03:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
an interface engine so we were
 
03:03:12.269 --> 03:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
leveraging uh the Medicaid Enterprise
 
03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
strategy um to identify a way in which
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
to implement one with federal funds to
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
help support it cuz system integration
 
03:03:23.910 --> 03:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
is pretty expensive um it's a lot
 
03:03:26.469 --> 03:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
cheaper if we can get 90% federal funds
 
03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
um to the to the state it's cheaper to
 
03:03:30.429 --> 03:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
the state but it certainly doesn't
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the total cost of of ownership
 
03:03:36.670 --> 03:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
for the solution so we we are finalizing
 
03:03:39.590 --> 03:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
that RFP it's still an RFP hasn't been
 
03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
um awarded yet and it would be going to
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council hopefully
 
03:03:46.510 --> 03:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
in the next couple months at which point
 
03:03:48.349 --> 03:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
we would be able to do what you're
 
03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
saying is build a one to many um
 
03:03:53.790 --> 03:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
interface engine and be able to build
 
03:03:55.229 --> 03:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
those standards and publish those
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
standards and future contracts for
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
vendors to consume and use whereas today
 
03:04:02.950 --> 03:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's every vendor creates a new
 
03:04:04.830 --> 03:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
interface and charges us for that
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
interface in the future we will be
 
03:04:11.190 --> 03:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
expecting that they come to The Proposal
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
with how are they going to consume or
 
03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:21.950 --> 03:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
New Heights um on a regular basis
 
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
because of many federal and legislative
 
03:04:28.550 --> 03:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
um State Legislative mandates has to be
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
able to change on a regular basis to
 
03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
meet program needs so that system is
 
03:04:35.670 --> 03:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
very stable we've invested a large
 
03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money on that system it is
 
03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
also an on- premise solution it is
 
03:04:43.950 --> 03:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
managed um by a contract that um do um
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
just finished going out to bid for for a
 
03:04:49.389 --> 03:04:49.399 align:start position:0%
vendor that manages the hardware for us
 
03:04:52.469 --> 03:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
and ensures that it's up has a high up
 
03:04:56.349 --> 03:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
time and a Disaster Recovery Solution um
 
03:04:59.790 --> 03:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
that that system however
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
is needs constant care and feeding in
 
03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
terms of enhancements to meet the
 
03:05:07.590 --> 03:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
everchanging needs of our of our or of
 
03:05:09.990 --> 03:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
our state in in our federal Direction so
 
03:05:13.389 --> 03:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see in future
 
03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
um operational budgets that we will be
 
03:05:18.229 --> 03:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
asking for additional funds to to
 
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
support those enhancements and I I'll
 
03:05:22.990 --> 03:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
reach back out to make sure that we
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
address some of this these questions CU
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't have all of that for today but
 
03:05:30.630 --> 03:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best and we'll you may have
 
03:05:33.750 --> 03:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
you may hear from the directors or other
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
parts of our department correcting me as
 
03:05:39.389 --> 03:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.990 --> 03:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
forward and then going to slide
 
03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
10 um really the behavioral health
 
03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
system the web information technology
 
03:05:51.670 --> 03:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
system is a stable electron medical
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
record system it does support the
 
03:05:57.229 --> 03:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
services that you can read there today
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
um that is uh it's hosted by the vendor
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't necessarily call that one a
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
cloud-based solution because it is
 
03:06:09.309 --> 03:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
hosted on the vendors data center um it
 
03:06:12.389 --> 03:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
cloud is a if I Define cloud is like
 
03:06:15.670 --> 03:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
hosting on Amazon web services or Google
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
um Google cloud services or Microsoft
 
03:06:21.150 --> 03:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
off service jure this one resides just
 
03:06:24.269 --> 03:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
in the the vendors could I do a time
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
check here y we have Contracting and
 
03:06:31.750 --> 03:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
performance metrics still um um I Mr
 
03:06:34.150 --> 03:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
White how do you think you're doing on
 
03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:06:38.710 --> 03:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
availability um I Dave do you just want
 
03:06:41.150 --> 03:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
to touch really quick on those or there
 
03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
particular on items you'd like to
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
highlight just for time Bridges I I I
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'll let you know I'd like you to come
 
03:06:50.950 --> 03:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
back and kind of re repitch your slides
 
03:06:55.469 --> 03:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
to more of the system uh profiles the
 
03:06:57.670 --> 03:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
kinds of things I was asking earlier
 
03:07:00.190 --> 03:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
about you know where are we with a
 
03:07:02.229 --> 03:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
stable system is it end of life what
 
03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
kind of interface issues are we have
 
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
what sort of future capabilities do we
 
03:07:09.269 --> 03:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
need I I I think I think that's kind of
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
more of um the things that are going to
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
have a productivity and a financial
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
impact that we want to look at I I
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
assume assume all the functionality is
 
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
there that supports the
 
03:07:25.630 --> 03:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
Departments um so yep so I'm kind of I
 
03:07:27.830 --> 03:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of ready to uh ask you to come
 
03:07:30.750 --> 03:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
back with a a different
 
03:07:36.510 --> 03:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
so excellent so if you turn to slide 14
 
03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you Dave very much appreciate
 
03:07:46.990 --> 03:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
it if you readers it it was good I I I
 
03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
don't mean I I just didn't communicate
 
03:07:51.070 --> 03:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
well enough on what I was thinking I was
 
03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
going to hear today I
 
03:07:54.870 --> 03:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
apologize I appreciate it thank you very
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
much and I will I will create an updated
 
03:07:59.870 --> 03:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
slide Deck with those parameters and we
 
03:08:01.710 --> 03:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
can share it with this committee maybe
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
and you can see if we want you would
 
03:08:06.349 --> 03:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
want me to come back for a testimony as
 
03:08:08.910 --> 03:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
well excellent thank you
 
03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
Dave so beginning on slide 14 we're
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
going to talk a little bit about the
 
03:08:14.710 --> 03:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
Department's centralized Contracting
 
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
functions and HHS uh again we are a
 
03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
large department and we handle a lot of
 
03:08:22.110 --> 03:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
solicitations annually and we handle a
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
lot of contracts and a lot of amendments
 
03:08:25.790 --> 03:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see that come
 
03:08:28.309 --> 03:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
through in each of the uh budget
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
presentations later on after February
 
03:08:32.670 --> 03:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
15th once we once we start into those
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
conversations and so we thought that'd
 
03:08:36.429 --> 03:08:36.439 align:start position:0%
be really important just to provide
 
03:08:38.349 --> 03:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
everybody with a baseline understanding
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
of what what contracts in New Hampshire
 
03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
looks like because normally this process
 
03:08:45.389 --> 03:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
is very G or very governor and executive
 
03:08:47.150 --> 03:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
counsel involved and it's not something
 
03:08:48.590 --> 03:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
that the the legislature really gets
 
03:08:50.389 --> 03:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
directly involved so I don't want to
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
assume anything just as far as folks
 
03:08:53.150 --> 03:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge around this so we're just
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
going to do a baseline uh just sort of
 
03:08:57.429 --> 03:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
catch up around some of the basics and
 
03:09:00.550 --> 03:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
how our department handles this so on
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
that first slide um you'll see we we
 
03:09:04.710 --> 03:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
have that central unit and that central
 
03:09:07.229 --> 03:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
unit came into being uh over a decade
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
ago uh and the department at that time
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
decided it would be more effective more
 
03:09:13.150 --> 03:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
efficient to put all the contracts
 
03:09:15.429 --> 03:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
through a singular unit because
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
Contracting is uh certain a bit of a
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
science it's a bit of an art and a
 
03:09:22.590 --> 03:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of everything in between and
 
03:09:25.469 --> 03:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of rules and regulations
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
at the federal level at the state level
 
03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
at the executive Council level coming
 
03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
through U mop 150 as it's referred to
 
03:09:33.190 --> 03:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
its manable procedures and those are
 
03:09:35.550 --> 03:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
rules that the executive Council issues
 
03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
one such rule I think that a lot of
 
03:09:39.150 --> 03:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
folks here have heard before every
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
contract over $10,000 has to be approved
 
03:09:43.510 --> 03:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
by the executive Council any amendment
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
to any subsequent contract that was
 
03:09:47.790 --> 03:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
approved also needs to go through the
 
03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
executive Council and so that is a lot
 
03:09:52.229 --> 03:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
that that's a lot of work it's a lot of
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork it's a lot of legal review
 
03:09:55.309 --> 03:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of Attorney General
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
involvement and and we just wanted to
 
03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that folks sort of understood
 
03:10:01.229 --> 03:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
many of the controls that are in place
 
03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
when we are Contracting out those funds
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the procedures that we follow in
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
order to make sure quality services are
 
03:10:10.510 --> 03:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
delivered so uh we do um W within the
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
contracts team uh they see about over $2
 
03:10:15.150 --> 03:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
billion of contracts and amendments go
 
03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
through that team each year and now mind
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
that does include the MCO contracts
 
03:10:21.429 --> 03:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
which uh I believe Henry is going to
 
03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
talk about next week and th th those
 
03:10:25.870 --> 03:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
contracts have a shared price limitation
 
03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
of over a billion dollars and so that
 
03:10:32.110 --> 03:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
certainly comprises the chunk of a very
 
03:10:34.349 --> 03:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
large chunk of the contracts that go
 
03:10:37.469 --> 03:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
through the team there we we do about 92
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
solicitations and so when I use the term
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
solicitation typically people call this
 
03:10:43.750 --> 03:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
a request for proposal we also do
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
requests for applications requests for
 
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
Grant applications requests for bids and
 
03:10:49.950 --> 03:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
there's different tools and each you you
 
03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
use one of those tools depending on the
 
03:10:52.910 --> 03:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
nature of the service that you're
 
03:10:56.670 --> 03:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
looking for and um and and and we try to
 
03:10:58.229 --> 03:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
maximize that and some take a little
 
03:11:00.670 --> 03:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
longer some take a some are a little bit
 
03:11:03.309 --> 03:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
more efficient but you don't necessarily
 
03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
want to do requests for bids when you're
 
03:11:06.910 --> 03:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
talking about services that are being
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
provided to people or someone's making
 
03:11:11.710 --> 03:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh determinations that's
 
03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
where we need to make sure that we get
 
03:11:15.870 --> 03:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
the programmatic details correct and we
 
03:11:17.790 --> 03:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
go with the vendor that has the best
 
03:11:20.309 --> 03:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
score and so on the right there you're
 
03:11:21.550 --> 03:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
going to see the
 
03:11:25.389 --> 03:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
volume and the very bottom line there
 
03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's 2019 and the other day I or
 
03:11:31.550 --> 03:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday I guess I had presented and I
 
03:11:32.830 --> 03:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
had talked a little bit about the many
 
03:11:34.229 --> 03:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
improvements that the team has been
 
03:11:36.670 --> 03:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
making over the years and one of the
 
03:11:39.229 --> 03:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
goals one of the key goals has been to
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
not submit 300 contracts the last two
 
03:11:44.950 --> 03:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
June GNC meetings which typically
 
03:11:48.229 --> 03:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
happened and that's not good because a
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
it forces our providers to have to turn
 
03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
around very very quickly some complex
 
03:11:54.429 --> 03:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
legal documents they may not have time
 
03:11:57.150 --> 03:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
to review and it's really important that
 
03:11:59.429 --> 03:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
we give the counselors adequate time as
 
03:12:01.389 --> 03:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
well to make sure that they have time to
 
03:12:03.469 --> 03:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
review and ask the questions that they
 
03:12:05.710 --> 03:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
have and so we've done a lot of work
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
around that to try to get that process a
 
03:12:10.269 --> 03:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more evened out across each
 
03:12:12.030 --> 03:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
year so it's not all happening at the
 
03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
end of the year and there's forecasting
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
methodologies and systems that underlay
 
03:12:19.150 --> 03:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
that and and did he was kind enough to
 
03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
um put a shout out to the team on
 
03:12:24.190 --> 03:12:24.200 align:start position:0%
DocuSign so the the process that he
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
referenced as far as executing a
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
contract it used to take two weeks and
 
03:12:30.030 --> 03:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
it used to involve people driving around
 
03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
the state trying to find people to to
 
03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
hand sign a record last I checked I
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
think was about 37 minutes to have the
 
03:12:40.910 --> 03:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
department sign have the vendor sign and
 
03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General approve and that's
 
03:12:44.229 --> 03:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
obviously we're doing a lot of pre-work
 
03:12:47.309 --> 03:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
in advance of that but we took what was
 
03:12:48.830 --> 03:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
someone driving around in a car around
 
03:12:51.389 --> 03:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
the state and condense that down into
 
03:12:54.670 --> 03:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know a very efficient process um you
 
03:12:56.550 --> 03:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
know we at the time we were saying well
 
03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
you can sign off on a new mortgage on
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
your phone why can't we do that and so
 
03:13:02.309 --> 03:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
we put a little effort into it and we
 
03:13:04.510 --> 03:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
ended up with a good solution so if you
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
move on to page 15 I am not going to go
 
03:13:09.790 --> 03:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
into the detail here but this is a
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
30,000 foot view of the process and I've
 
03:13:15.389 --> 03:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
cited many of the applicable statutes
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
that the department has to adhere year
 
03:13:19.389 --> 03:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
to and we and another really key
 
03:13:21.070 --> 03:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
takeaway here is we work with the
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology for
 
03:13:24.590 --> 03:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
our it contracts we work with the
 
03:13:26.389 --> 03:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
Department with the um Department of
 
03:13:28.990 --> 03:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
Justice the Attorney General's office as
 
03:13:30.630 --> 03:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
well and we also have to work with them
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
at multiple stages throughout this
 
03:13:35.830 --> 03:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
process and
 
03:13:38.910 --> 03:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
typically an RFP could take anywhere
 
03:13:42.070 --> 03:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
from 4 to 12 months depending on a lot
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
of factors and one of the things that
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
we've done is we've surveyed our um our
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
providers over the years to say how much
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
time is reasonable for you to respond to
 
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
an RFP and historically we were posting
 
03:13:56.469 --> 03:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
those for three or four weeks and we
 
03:13:58.309 --> 03:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
made this change years ago where we
 
03:14:00.630 --> 03:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
switched that to a minimum of s to eight
 
03:14:01.990 --> 03:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
weeks because we wanted to make sure
 
03:14:04.110 --> 03:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
that they had time to look at it think
 
03:14:06.150 --> 03:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
about it and give us a solid response
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
because what we were seeing was we we
 
03:14:09.990 --> 03:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
would just well uh they're not ready
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
they weren't able to give us a response
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
we need to delay that that date that
 
03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's due and and so um that's one Factor
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
the factor where contract negotiations
 
03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
don't always anybody that's ever been
 
03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
involved in contract negotiations it
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
really depends on the attorneys you're
 
03:14:27.990 --> 03:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
working with as far as how smooth that's
 
03:14:31.070 --> 03:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to go um you know we we we
 
03:14:33.550 --> 03:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
generally are able to do that um pretty
 
03:14:35.150 --> 03:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
pretty effectively but sometimes there
 
03:14:37.269 --> 03:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
are delays in that process that are
 
03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
outside of our control because the
 
03:14:41.309 --> 03:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
contractors or the providers that we're
 
03:14:43.469 --> 03:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
working with just need more time with
 
03:14:49.070 --> 03:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.550 --> 03:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
principally this is more of a principled
 
03:14:54.670 --> 03:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
conversation on this slide here our
 
03:14:56.710 --> 03:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
solicitations because these are State
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
these are State dollars these are public
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
funds these may be federal funds they
 
03:15:01.469 --> 03:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
may be General funds or other funds they
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
may be Governor commission
 
03:15:05.710 --> 03:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
funds number one of the one really
 
03:15:07.630 --> 03:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
important thing here is these are not
 
03:15:09.309 --> 03:15:09.319 align:start position:0%
our dollars and we need to make sure
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
that this process is competitive and we
 
03:15:13.269 --> 03:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that it's transparent
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
and there are laws um that exist that
 
03:15:19.469 --> 03:15:19.479 align:start position:0%
require that whatever you are going to
 
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
be evaluating the proposals On th that
 
03:15:24.750 --> 03:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
criteria needs to be known to all
 
03:15:26.429 --> 03:15:26.439 align:start position:0%
parties that needs to be public that
 
03:15:28.790 --> 03:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be posted and we need to score
 
03:15:32.189 --> 03:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
consistently to that criteria and and we
 
03:15:33.870 --> 03:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
we take that very seriously and that's
 
03:15:35.229 --> 03:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of having a
 
03:15:37.150 --> 03:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
centralized unit because they're trained
 
03:15:38.750 --> 03:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
on those laws and they understand them
 
03:15:40.030 --> 03:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
and they know how to interpret them and
 
03:15:41.550 --> 03:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
apply to them in the real in the real
 
03:15:44.830 --> 03:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
world when we develop our agreements um
 
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
the centralized team has also developed
 
03:15:48.389 --> 03:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
standard templates and standard
 
03:15:50.229 --> 03:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
procedures and they've been trained on
 
03:15:54.229 --> 03:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
these things to ensure that we we have
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh Provisions within our contracts where
 
03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
we know that we're going to we're going
 
03:16:01.189 --> 03:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
to get what we're seeking for and part
 
03:16:03.189 --> 03:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
of the procurement process is
 
03:16:05.309 --> 03:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
translating here's a program so there's
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
a legislative bill that that that passes
 
03:16:11.830 --> 03:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's $500,000 towards this purpose okay
 
03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
now you need to go from there into a
 
03:16:16.990 --> 03:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
contract and you know obviously there's
 
03:16:18.870 --> 03:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of details to be filled in there
 
03:16:20.950 --> 03:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
and part of the work that transpires
 
03:16:23.189 --> 03:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
with this team is Translating that into
 
03:16:24.910 --> 03:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
how do we make this effective and
 
03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
efficient how are you going to manage it
 
03:16:28.750 --> 03:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
in the long run how are we going to pay
 
03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
the contractor are we going to do
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
deliverable based are we going to do
 
03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
cost reimbursement and and that's part
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
of what the team does there and we also
 
03:16:39.630 --> 03:16:39.640 align:start position:0%
this the contracts team is also very
 
03:16:42.349 --> 03:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
much involved in um some of the initial
 
03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
risk assessment so we conduct a risk
 
03:16:47.950 --> 03:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
assessment for many of our providers
 
03:16:50.229 --> 03:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
where we're looking at are they
 
03:16:52.349 --> 03:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
financially solvent what does their
 
03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
financial history look like have they
 
03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
had a change in leadership have they had
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
a change in accounting systems recently
 
03:17:00.110 --> 03:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
have they ever done this kind of work
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
before and we ask all those questions
 
03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
and based on what we're seeing and the
 
03:17:06.309 --> 03:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
risks we've identified we make
 
03:17:08.030 --> 03:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments in our contract so if we do
 
03:17:10.990 --> 03:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
see a high risk we may say okay because
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
you're a high- risk we're going to be on
 
03:17:14.790 --> 03:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
site every 3 or 4 months and we're going
 
03:17:17.349 --> 03:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
to be verifying your records or we may
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
ask you to please provide us with your
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
month with your monthly financials so we
 
03:17:23.229 --> 03:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
can make sure that we have a level of
 
03:17:25.630 --> 03:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
assurity that um you are financially
 
03:17:27.189 --> 03:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
solvent and you can deliver these
 
03:17:29.309 --> 03:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
critical services that you've agreed to
 
03:17:31.349 --> 03:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
deliver and the department can ensure
 
03:17:34.110 --> 03:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
that our mission uh can be carried out
 
03:17:35.990 --> 03:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
and and we don't we try to take a
 
03:17:38.710 --> 03:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
balance because we rely on our providers
 
03:17:40.750 --> 03:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
in the community to provide the services
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state and you can't
 
03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
just come in and say you know like
 
03:17:46.590 --> 03:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
you're my contractor and treat them you
 
03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
know like like unhuman family we have to
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
develop Partnerships and Meredith is
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
going to talk a little bit about what
 
03:17:54.429 --> 03:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
the Partnerships look like as far as
 
03:17:57.309 --> 03:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
like active contract management goes and
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
and what that looks like and so
 
03:18:00.750 --> 03:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a fine balance between
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
holding someone accountable but you also
 
03:18:04.710 --> 03:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we're going to be
 
03:18:06.510 --> 03:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
working with them for maybe two four six
 
03:18:07.750 --> 03:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
years depending on the terms of the
 
03:18:10.110 --> 03:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
contracts and we want to make sure that
 
03:18:11.790 --> 03:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
they're delivering the services in
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
accordance with their mission as well as
 
03:18:15.269 --> 03:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
the depart as well as the department and
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
the state's goals and that's a balancing
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
act if you turn to page 17 um so I'm not
 
03:18:24.990 --> 03:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
going to go too much into detail here
 
03:18:29.870 --> 03:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
but the the the bureau has continuously
 
03:18:32.309 --> 03:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
made a lot of improvements to try to
 
03:18:34.870 --> 03:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
make things more effective when we
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
listened to um our
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
providers in the past we had heard
 
03:18:41.830 --> 03:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
complaints around the process takes too
 
03:18:44.189 --> 03:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
long you know I'm only given two days to
 
03:18:47.309 --> 03:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
turn this around and and we've tried to
 
03:18:49.590 --> 03:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
take steps to address those things we've
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
also um years ago about 5 years ago or
 
03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
so we also made a lot of organizational
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
structure changes to make sure that work
 
03:18:58.990 --> 03:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
is distributed evenly which makes that
 
03:19:01.070 --> 03:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
process go a little bit faster we also
 
03:19:02.750 --> 03:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
have folks that specialize in certain
 
03:19:04.590 --> 03:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
areas because you're going to uh folks
 
03:19:05.710 --> 03:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
that have never been on this committee
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
for um you're going to have the other
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
divisions come through and you're going
 
03:19:10.990 --> 03:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
to see each each area of the department
 
03:19:13.469 --> 03:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
does have very specialized services and
 
03:19:15.150 --> 03:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
we need our procurement specialist to
 
03:19:16.389 --> 03:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
have that knowledge and develop that
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge over time um so there have
 
03:19:20.429 --> 03:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
been some very uh cognizant
 
03:19:22.229 --> 03:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
organizational changes made over the
 
03:19:25.469 --> 03:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
years to try to best align our resources
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
to get the job done um we've also we
 
03:19:30.349 --> 03:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
developed our own project tracking
 
03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
system years ago and we've since
 
03:19:33.950 --> 03:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
upgraded that to try to take advantage
 
03:19:36.269 --> 03:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
of some of the systems that Dave was uh
 
03:19:38.349 --> 03:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
alluding to earlier so that we can
 
03:19:40.870 --> 03:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
forecast when is something going to
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
expire okay 12 months before that we
 
03:19:45.710 --> 03:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
need to be talking internally to
 
03:19:47.670 --> 03:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
understand is this a priority because
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be working on a budget in
 
03:19:50.830 --> 03:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
the coming months and how do we make
 
03:19:53.229 --> 03:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
sure that we if we want to renew that we
 
03:19:55.189 --> 03:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
need to make sure a we have the money
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
but we also need to ask the question is
 
03:19:59.070 --> 03:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
the money being used effectively so that
 
03:20:01.150 --> 03:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
we don't get to May and say oh are we
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to renew this I don't know is it
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
effective well we haven't done that work
 
03:20:06.630 --> 03:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
and so that's part of the forecasting
 
03:20:09.030 --> 03:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
methodology to a kind of smooth out the
 
03:20:11.269 --> 03:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
work over time but B give us enough time
 
03:20:12.910 --> 03:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
to really reassess things at the
 
03:20:14.910 --> 03:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
organizational operational level to
 
03:20:16.950 --> 03:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
determine whether what we're spending
 
03:20:20.110 --> 03:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
money on is is effective and and uh
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
working towards our goals so I'm I I
 
03:20:24.389 --> 03:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
know I'm moving through this pretty
 
03:20:27.030 --> 03:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
quickly but I'm just cognizant of the
 
03:20:30.910 --> 03:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
time here so on um on slide
 
03:20:34.229 --> 03:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
18 if you shift ahead a little bit I've
 
03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
already touched on the ongoing internal
 
03:20:40.830 --> 03:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
and external surveys we do um conduct
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
internal surveys to both members of the
 
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
staff on the contract team to get
 
03:20:47.670 --> 03:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
information from them them as far as
 
03:20:50.269 --> 03:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
what what could we do better um what
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
what works what doesn't work because you
 
03:20:54.189 --> 03:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
always the people that are doing the
 
03:20:56.110 --> 03:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
detailed work are always going to know
 
03:20:57.670 --> 03:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
but then we also on the flip side when
 
03:20:59.429 --> 03:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
we have contracts that are approved we
 
03:21:01.150 --> 03:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
ask the vendors in the community what
 
03:21:02.790 --> 03:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
went well what didn't well and if we
 
03:21:05.229 --> 03:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
start to see patterns in that um
 
03:21:07.229 --> 03:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
obviously they're anecdotes but once you
 
03:21:09.469 --> 03:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
start to see patterns that requires an
 
03:21:11.070 --> 03:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
adjustment in some of the work that you
 
03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
do and and that's something that that is
 
03:21:17.189 --> 03:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
very much on our minds um I I already
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned the risk assessment so I'm not
 
03:21:21.269 --> 03:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
going to go into that too much and then
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
I also mentioned some of the business
 
03:21:24.990 --> 03:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
management systems so I'm going to move
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
forward into slide 19 to talk a little
 
03:21:31.630 --> 03:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
bit about the road map and um commitment
 
03:21:34.590 --> 03:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
3 initiative 5 in particular one of the
 
03:21:37.510 --> 03:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
challenges that we've heard uh from our
 
03:21:39.870 --> 03:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
providers in the community is that
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
invoice the invoicing process is
 
03:21:44.070 --> 03:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
challenging and it's difficult and we
 
03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
take that very seriously because if our
 
03:21:47.429 --> 03:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
providers can't get paid that's going to
 
03:21:50.990 --> 03:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
have serious ramifications for them and
 
03:21:53.950 --> 03:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
the initiative five what we're doing
 
03:21:57.150 --> 03:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
there is we are intentionally looking at
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
are there better ways to pay and ensure
 
03:22:02.950 --> 03:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we can still make sure that the
 
03:22:04.790 --> 03:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
funds are used effectively and the
 
03:22:08.229 --> 03:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
services are delivered and historically
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
the default in that everybody went to
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
was cost reimbursement it was cost
 
03:22:15.309 --> 03:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and what that means is you
 
03:22:17.550 --> 03:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
submit an invoice you submit supporting
 
03:22:20.070 --> 03:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
documentation to show me that you spent
 
03:22:22.950 --> 03:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
those dollars on that an alternative way
 
03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
of thinking is you come up with a rate
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at trying to implement
 
03:22:30.269 --> 03:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
uh a more standard procedure around are
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
there certain contracts where rate is
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
going to make more sense but to do that
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
it takes a little bit more upfront work
 
03:22:37.469 --> 03:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
and a little bit more thinking around
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay comprehensively what is this going
 
03:22:42.550 --> 03:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
to cost that particular provider and
 
03:22:44.269 --> 03:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
then we come up with a fixed rate and
 
03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
obviously that works in unit-based
 
03:22:47.590 --> 03:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
settings but it doesn't work in all
 
03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
cases we're also looking at trying to
 
03:22:52.189 --> 03:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
move towards more deliverable base rates
 
03:22:54.309 --> 03:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
and that shifts a burden of the risk
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
away from the state and to our providers
 
03:22:57.279 --> 03:22:58.150 align:start position:0%
away from the state and to our providers
at

03:22:58.150 --> 03:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
time and and it it's it's a different
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
way of paying it's all it it's also a
 
03:23:05.550 --> 03:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
different level of risk that that's kind
 
03:23:08.189 --> 03:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
of cost shifted a little bit but in some
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
cases some contractors may prefer that
 
03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
over the cost reimbursement it obviously
 
03:23:15.630 --> 03:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of invoicing work
 
03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done because if you get
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
the deliverable and you accept the
 
03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
deliverable you you achieve that goal
 
03:23:24.269 --> 03:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
and and that's um certainly Something
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
That We're consider considering and
 
03:23:29.309 --> 03:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
working towards uh more frequently m m
 
03:23:31.830 --> 03:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
Mr White yes sir um just just a thought
 
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
on that um do you think the department
 
03:23:40.590 --> 03:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
can make money by U Better managing the
 
03:23:42.590 --> 03:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
the risk sharing we're doing with our
 
03:23:46.030 --> 03:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
vendors or or or we kind of already sort
 
03:23:48.630 --> 03:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
of in a in a good stable State there
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
could is there a way for us maybe to be
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
look at uh liability shifting or risk
 
03:23:59.469 --> 03:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
shifting as a way for us to be more uh
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
efficient C can you define what you mean
 
03:24:03.630 --> 03:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
by make
 
03:24:07.469 --> 03:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
money okay so let let's say we uh do a
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
contract and uh we accept all the risk
 
03:24:12.830 --> 03:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
associated with the contract being
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
completed on time versus we do the same
 
03:24:19.309 --> 03:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
contract but we we we change the
 
03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
incentive so that uh they pay us
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
penalties or or we give them an
 
03:24:26.710 --> 03:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
incentive in order to uh do better
 
03:24:29.550 --> 03:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
ontime performance so just by managing
 
03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
the risk profile of a contract are we
 
03:24:34.830 --> 03:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
could could could could we make more
 
03:24:38.269 --> 03:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
money for the state basically so we we
 
03:24:41.429 --> 03:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
do use liquidated damages um in a couple
 
03:24:43.870 --> 03:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
of our high-profile contracts primarily
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
the MCO contracts the MCO contracts also
 
03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
Al have um some risk quarters and other
 
03:24:51.630 --> 03:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
incentive Provisions to make sure that
 
03:24:54.590 --> 03:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
quality services are delivered um and
 
03:24:56.269 --> 03:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
and I can certainly have Henry speak to
 
03:24:58.750 --> 03:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
that a little bit next week typically
 
03:25:02.429 --> 03:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
speaking though when we have um you know
 
03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
a 6year million dollar contract or
 
03:25:06.030 --> 03:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
something like that with a small
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit provider we're very aware of
 
03:25:14.830 --> 03:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
um pushing Financial Risk on onto a
 
03:25:17.150 --> 03:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
small organization like that
 
03:25:19.309 --> 03:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
and we don't necessarily always think
 
03:25:21.229 --> 03:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
that that could be in the best interest
 
03:25:24.590 --> 03:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the state I think related to that
 
03:25:25.830 --> 03:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of conversations
 
03:25:28.429 --> 03:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
internally over the years relative to
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
establishing performance payment and
 
03:25:35.189 --> 03:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
again you need a really strong reporting
 
03:25:37.830 --> 03:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
system to
 
03:25:40.630 --> 03:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
incentivize and track that kind of
 
03:25:43.950 --> 03:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
payment and when I've talked to um
 
03:25:45.429 --> 03:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
individuals at the harbor government
 
03:25:47.550 --> 03:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
performance lab specialize in
 
03:25:48.630 --> 03:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
procurement they work with a lot of
 
03:25:50.349 --> 03:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
different states across the country
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
they've generally said that they have
 
03:25:54.389 --> 03:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
not seen performance pay be very
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
effective for a lot of the
 
03:25:59.349 --> 03:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um you know direct service
 
03:26:02.670 --> 03:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
care providers um that that HHS works
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
with it it certainly Works in other
 
03:26:06.750 --> 03:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
areas but but because of the nature of
 
03:26:09.070 --> 03:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
our business it's not something that we
 
03:26:11.710 --> 03:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
typically uh really encourage or move
 
03:26:13.469 --> 03:26:13.479 align:start position:0%
towards just because we're very
 
03:26:16.349 --> 03:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
sensitive uh to the the type of
 
03:26:17.550 --> 03:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
communities that we're working with and
 
03:26:20.510 --> 03:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
the providers I I appreciate your answer
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
and and more so I appreciate the thought
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
behind your answer thank you of course
 
03:26:29.309 --> 03:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
and now finally one one thing that that
 
03:26:31.349 --> 03:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
we're moving towards as well that I
 
03:26:34.030 --> 03:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
think is really important is we're
 
03:26:35.550 --> 03:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
always going to have cost reimbursement
 
03:26:37.990 --> 03:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
contracts and but we want to make those
 
03:26:39.990 --> 03:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
less burdensome administratively and so
 
03:26:42.269 --> 03:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
we are moving towards a risk based
 
03:26:44.469 --> 03:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
invoicing process where basically if you
 
03:26:46.269 --> 03:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
submit all your invoices we check it and
 
03:26:48.790 --> 03:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
looks good then we're not going to ask
 
03:26:50.830 --> 03:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
for that information again for maybe 2 3
 
03:26:52.910 --> 03:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
4 5 months part of this depends on the
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
risk and that initial risk assessment I
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
was talking about so that we can still
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
provide a reasonable level of assurity
 
03:27:01.389 --> 03:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
that we're getting the services and
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're paying for the services that we
 
03:27:05.229 --> 03:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
need but we also still have controls in
 
03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
place so when the Auditors come around
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
we can demonstrate yes we have overseen
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
these dollars and internally to
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
management and to the legislature yes we
 
03:27:16.510 --> 03:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
have received the services that we
 
03:27:20.830 --> 03:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
sought to receive so that that's a very
 
03:27:23.070 --> 03:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
quick I can talk about contracts all day
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things I get excited
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
about um my wife loves it but but but
 
03:27:30.429 --> 03:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm going to talk about that
 
03:27:32.750 --> 03:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
Valentine Day is coming
 
03:27:34.910 --> 03:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
up you're right I I need to make
 
03:27:36.910 --> 03:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
reservation somewhere that's a good
 
03:27:41.150 --> 03:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
idea uh represent walner thank you so
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
this kind of goes back I should have
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
asked it earlier but when you're um
 
03:27:48.429 --> 03:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
starting a contract particularly like
 
03:27:51.189 --> 03:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
with a small nonprofit who may never
 
03:27:53.790 --> 03:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
have had a contract with the state
 
03:27:56.590 --> 03:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
before so what kind of help do you give
 
03:27:58.510 --> 03:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
them along the way information do you
 
03:28:01.670 --> 03:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
provide them I I've had a number of
 
03:28:06.110 --> 03:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
occasions when um small contractors are
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
really confused by the process and why
 
03:28:10.670 --> 03:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
they have to do all these
 
03:28:14.030 --> 03:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
things yes so um we have been working
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Center for
 
03:28:18.189 --> 03:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
nonprofit over the past couple years and
 
03:28:20.910 --> 03:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
um Robert Moore our contracts director
 
03:28:23.070 --> 03:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
and Brook po Provost our administrator
 
03:28:25.349 --> 03:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
within contracts and uh I believe Mickey
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
kellerer our grants administrator
 
03:28:28.870 --> 03:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
they've they've tried to provide some of
 
03:28:30.830 --> 03:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
the technical assistance training to
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller nonprofits because
 
03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
there's when a you're working with the
 
03:28:40.469 --> 03:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
state there's a number of state laws
 
03:28:43.510 --> 03:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily intuitive and B
 
03:28:46.269 --> 03:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with federal dollars
 
03:28:48.030 --> 03:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
all of the requirements that are handed
 
03:28:50.189 --> 03:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
to the department as far as tracking
 
03:28:53.550 --> 03:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
every dollar so if you pay if you pay an
 
03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
employee salary with federal funds you
 
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
need some method to track those those
 
03:29:00.590 --> 03:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
federal dollars to make sure that their
 
03:29:03.710 --> 03:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
time is expensed back to that some of
 
03:29:05.349 --> 03:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
those Concepts aren't necessarily
 
03:29:09.229 --> 03:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
intuitive and my on the finance team we
 
03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
do from time to time get requests to go
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
and meet with the providers and we
 
03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes assist them with developing
 
03:29:18.389 --> 03:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
their specific invoice so if you ever
 
03:29:20.550 --> 03:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
hear of a case of that I I always
 
03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend that they reach out
 
03:29:23.630 --> 03:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
because if they've never gone through
 
03:29:26.910 --> 03:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
this before we we will help them um
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
there's also generally speaking during
 
03:29:31.389 --> 03:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
the solicitation phase so when we post
 
03:29:31.399 --> 03:29:32.389 align:start position:0%
the solicitation phase so when we post
an

03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
RFP uh to the time that it goes to GNC
 
03:29:37.590 --> 03:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's this sort of blackout period
 
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
where we're not able to say much of
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
anything to anyone about that
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
procurement and if it's ever terminated
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
we can't say anything for two years or
 
03:29:49.110 --> 03:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
it's our say 21 or R say 21 G37 and it's
 
03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's very specific about what
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
information we can release and I think
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
that was more of a risk-based
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
conversation when that statute took in
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
effect any other
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions um did were were you done or
 
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
did you yes I I'll call Merith up if
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
she's okay did did you cover um I I I
 
03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
was thinking so many different things I
 
03:30:20.790 --> 03:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
I may have missed did you cover um
 
03:30:22.830 --> 03:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
anything you might have done over the
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
last two three years to make the uh
 
03:30:29.950 --> 03:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
public awareness greater for for when
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
we're soliciting for vendors I I I was I
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
was kind of hoping to hear what we were
 
03:30:39.269 --> 03:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
doing to just be more public facing
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
about what's available to get more
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
involvement in competition yeah so we
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
we've done a couple of things um number
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
one we've tried to use our social media
 
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
platforms a little bit more heavily so
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
HHS has a presence on I think three or
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
four uh social media platforms and
 
03:30:58.670 --> 03:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
anytime we post an RFP RFA RFP we try to
 
03:31:00.750 --> 03:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that those get posted on there
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
um historically there was also a very
 
03:31:05.590 --> 03:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
low threshold for notifying folks there
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
it was the more of a perception of oh
 
03:31:09.309 --> 03:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to be providing favoritism
 
03:31:10.750 --> 03:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
to a particular group if they're the
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
only ones that hear about it what we
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
always try to do is is we we're not as
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
risk averse as we once were we try to
 
03:31:20.150 --> 03:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
send out Communications to known list
 
03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
server list serves or groups of
 
03:31:23.990 --> 03:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that are going to be
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
interest interested in something what we
 
03:31:28.189 --> 03:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
can't do is we can't provide any special
 
03:31:30.269 --> 03:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
information or advantage to those groups
 
03:31:31.750 --> 03:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
but we try to take at Le at least some
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
of those proactive steps um what we see
 
03:31:37.229 --> 03:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
on average is about four responses to
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
each for the last three years about four
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
responses to each solicitation the most
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
we've ever had is 40 the least we've
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
ever had is zero and we never like to
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
see Zero because that's a big waste of
 
03:31:49.950 --> 03:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's time but that that's more of
 
03:31:53.110 --> 03:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
the exception than than the rule for
 
03:31:55.110 --> 03:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
sure of
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
course good afternoon everyone my name
 
03:31:59.910 --> 03:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
is Meredith tus I am the director of the
 
03:32:01.389 --> 03:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
division of program quality and
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
integrity for the department and I'm
 
03:32:05.389 --> 03:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
going to be talking a little bit about
 
03:32:10.189 --> 03:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:14.429 --> 03:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
performance that's right um so to start
 
03:32:15.469 --> 03:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
I was kind of going to frame my
 
03:32:17.630 --> 03:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
discussion around some of the some of
 
03:32:19.389 --> 03:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
the uh bullets that you saw in the
 
03:32:21.389 --> 03:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
presentation yesterday that were covered
 
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
related to this so that includes fraud
 
03:32:26.110 --> 03:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse monitoring Financial
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
integrity and stability of providers
 
03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
audits of
 
03:32:30.080 --> 03:32:33.389 align:start position:0%
audits of
providers

03:32:33.389 --> 03:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
um and developing meaningful metrics to
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
evaluate performance so we'll go over
 
03:32:41.150 --> 03:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
each of those a little bit first fraud
 
03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse uh we have a number of
 
03:32:45.870 --> 03:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
different methods that we use to
 
03:32:49.550 --> 03:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
evaluate identify deter and then recover
 
03:32:52.229 --> 03:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
on fraud waste and abuse so perhaps most
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
importantly is um we work with our
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations to identify
 
03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid provider fraud waste and abuse
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
and that includes uh investigations that
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
are constantly ongoing both for us and
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
for our Managed Care
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
organizations and we have 25 last year
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
we had 25 referrals to the Medicaid
 
03:33:14.510 --> 03:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
fraud control unit at the Department of
 
03:33:16.269 --> 03:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
Justice so that's an example
 
03:33:18.510 --> 03:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
of some of the types of Investigations
 
03:33:20.510 --> 03:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
we do around fraud waste and
 
03:33:23.309 --> 03:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
abuse question do you have like a
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
ballpark of what those 25 were worth are
 
03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
we talking a million dollars 25 million
 
03:33:31.830 --> 03:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
how how how how big a it might be it
 
03:33:33.189 --> 03:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
might be around that it might be a
 
03:33:34.990 --> 03:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
little less really depends on the case
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
right so you have some cases that are
 
03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
actually worth quite a bit of money and
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
some cases that aren't um what we're
 
03:33:42.229 --> 03:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
looking for in those fraud cases though
 
03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
is whether or not there was some kind of
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
intent to defraud
 
03:33:49.229 --> 03:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
so these are these are not necessarily
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
big money instances but they're
 
03:33:52.750 --> 03:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
instances where we're trying to say this
 
03:33:54.429 --> 03:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
provider really intended to defraud
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and they shouldn't be allowed
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
to be a Medicaid provider at this point
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that's that's more what those are
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
geared toward we do overpayment
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
recoveries on a regular basis that are
 
03:34:05.790 --> 03:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily related to fraud those
 
03:34:07.269 --> 03:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
would fall into the waste and abuse
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
categories and those are worth hundreds
 
03:34:10.950 --> 03:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars a
 
03:34:10.960 --> 03:34:13.229 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars a
year

03:34:13.229 --> 03:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
y uh so
 
03:34:18.389 --> 03:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
also around concerns of fraud waster
 
03:34:20.550 --> 03:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
abuse we have numerous Federal audits
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
that take place during the year there's
 
03:34:24.189 --> 03:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
probably anywhere from three to five
 
03:34:25.790 --> 03:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
Federal audits that take place across
 
03:34:28.150 --> 03:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
the department in a year the largest one
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
being the state single audit which
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
happens of all departments and for DHHS
 
03:34:35.910 --> 03:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
that usually includes um anywhere
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
between five and 10 of our programs
 
03:34:39.870 --> 03:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
could be audited in a single year
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
anything that includes major federal
 
03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
funding our division dpq division of
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
program called and integrity facilitates
 
03:34:49.229 --> 03:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
all of those Federal audits so the
 
03:34:50.670 --> 03:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
single audit and all of the other
 
03:34:53.429 --> 03:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
individual Federal audits we will sit
 
03:34:55.389 --> 03:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
with the program area with their
 
03:34:57.150 --> 03:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
financial staff during the entrance
 
03:34:58.630 --> 03:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
conference we will understand what the
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
audit's going to be about and then when
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
the report or findings are completed we
 
03:35:04.469 --> 03:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
will read those go through it with the
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
program area and make sure that they're
 
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
appropriately mitigating the findings if
 
03:35:09.790 --> 03:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
there are federal funds that need to be
 
03:35:11.229 --> 03:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
returned we make sure the return happens
 
03:35:16.590 --> 03:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:18.750 --> 03:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
Nathan talked a little bit about uh what
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
we do to monitor the financial integrity
 
03:35:23.229 --> 03:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
and stability of our providers including
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
our contracts and that really includes
 
03:35:30.349 --> 03:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
um monthly getting financial statements
 
03:35:32.429 --> 03:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
from a variety of providers we don't do
 
03:35:34.630 --> 03:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
this for every contract we do not have
 
03:35:37.070 --> 03:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
the capacity and it's not necessary for
 
03:35:38.429 --> 03:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
every contract to get this kind of
 
03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
information but for select groups of
 
03:35:42.269 --> 03:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
providers we get monthly financial
 
03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
statements and then we analyze those
 
03:35:46.269 --> 03:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
with financial ratios we're looking at
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
whether they have Surplus deficits the
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
cash on hand their debt service coverage
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
things like that where we think that
 
03:35:55.189 --> 03:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
there are concerns we would reach out to
 
03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
a provider we'd meet with them we'd have
 
03:35:56.960 --> 03:35:57.670 align:start position:0%
a provider we'd meet with them we'd have
a

03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
conversation um we may ask for a
 
03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan depending upon
 
03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing so the corrective
 
03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
action plan would include something like
 
03:36:08.710 --> 03:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so just being clear on what we
 
03:36:11.590 --> 03:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
means we means you and your department
 
03:36:13.870 --> 03:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
or you mean you go to
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
somebody no it would be my staff working
 
03:36:18.550 --> 03:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
probably with Nathan's staff okay Andor
 
03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
the program it really depends on the
 
03:36:22.150 --> 03:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
program who's going to do Outreach but
 
03:36:24.309 --> 03:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
we'll meet with the providers and have a
 
03:36:26.189 --> 03:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
conversation around what we're seeing to
 
03:36:28.510 --> 03:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
so that they can help us understand what
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
they think the cause is how they plan to
 
03:36:32.590 --> 03:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
remedy it how long we think that remedy
 
03:36:39.510 --> 03:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:42.349 --> 03:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
you we have a couple more questions
 
03:36:44.429 --> 03:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you uh
 
03:36:46.990 --> 03:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a followup to what you just said
 
03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:49.150 align:start position:0%
kind of a followup to what you just said
um

03:36:49.150 --> 03:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
so you don't monitor every possible risk
 
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
you don't have the staff to analyze
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
every possible risk what kind of process
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
do you have to kind of
 
03:37:05.110 --> 03:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
connect what the risks are and how
 
03:37:07.710 --> 03:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
frequent it might be a problem with the
 
03:37:11.070 --> 03:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
mitigation that you use and so how
 
03:37:13.790 --> 03:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
what's the ROI on what you do how do you
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
evaluate that it's a great question yep
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I think Nathan alluded to this at
 
03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the Contracting process
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
every contractor is required to complete
 
03:37:25.389 --> 03:37:25.399 align:start position:0%
uh a Financial Risk analysis and and
 
03:37:26.990 --> 03:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
what we call a management questionnaire
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
which is sort of our programmatic risk
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
analysis so that gives us an
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of their financial
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
standing right up front and it also
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
tells us kind of key key identifiers of
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not there could be a
 
03:37:41.429 --> 03:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
management issue have they had Federal
 
03:37:43.349 --> 03:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
findings in their own single audits have
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
they had key turnover in management
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
um has there been a change of ownership
 
03:37:50.469 --> 03:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
things like that so so we're looking at
 
03:37:52.830 --> 03:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
that upfront in the Contracting process
 
03:37:54.269 --> 03:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
and then from that we determine their
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
risk level and from that we determine
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the kind of monitoring that's
 
03:37:59.710 --> 03:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate does that answer your
 
03:38:01.510 --> 03:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay yes Mr chairman um on the this that
 
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe this is a covered by the
 
03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
question you just answered but when you
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
say specific provider types what how
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
what does that mean uh so a standard has
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
been for example um um our area agencies
 
03:38:24.990 --> 03:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
have always given us this information on
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis and they're a little bit
 
03:38:28.469 --> 03:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
different because of the way that they
 
03:38:30.750 --> 03:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
are designated by the department and
 
03:38:32.550 --> 03:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
every five years we have to redesignate
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
them but so that would be an example of
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
a set of providers that's providing this
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
information so it's an an agency sorry
 
03:38:43.590 --> 03:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
follow up an agency provider is a type
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
area agencies yes for our developmental
 
03:38:48.269 --> 03:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
Services area agencies and what other
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
types uh uh other types would be cmhc's
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
which are also designated are substance
 
03:38:55.520 --> 03:38:57.309 align:start position:0%
which are also designated are substance
use

03:38:57.309 --> 03:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:39:00.950 --> 03:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
providers oh uh Community Mental Health
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
Centers would be one and also the uh
 
03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
treatment providers for for substance
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
use disorder providers those are other
 
03:39:10.990 --> 03:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
examples of types of providers okay
 
03:39:16.590 --> 03:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:18.830 --> 03:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
so I think that Nathan also alluded to
 
03:39:20.670 --> 03:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
another form of oversight we do is
 
03:39:23.469 --> 03:39:23.479 align:start position:0%
audits of providers so for Medicaid
 
03:39:26.189 --> 03:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
providers we do investigations for all
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
of our other contractors we can do
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
audits those might be desk audits or
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
they might be site reviews but we would
 
03:39:34.189 --> 03:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
actually go out and look at agency's
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
financial statements compare them to
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
things like their General ledgers their
 
03:39:40.429 --> 03:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
payroll registers and do kind of deeper
 
03:39:42.429 --> 03:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
Dives on specific agencies where we
 
03:39:44.349 --> 03:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
think that there's some kind of risk and
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
we've done that um in a number of areas
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
we've done it for peer support agencies
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
um again substance use disorder
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
providers um public health and I think
 
03:39:55.070 --> 03:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
that this year we're going to be working
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
with our Bureau of uh adult and Aging
 
03:39:59.670 --> 03:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
Services as well so those are the types
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
of oversight we do yep these are all
 
03:40:05.790 --> 03:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
great functions these are very healthy
 
03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
things for an organization to do I'm and
 
03:40:12.990 --> 03:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
I've heard you over the years talk about
 
03:40:16.590 --> 03:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
capacity so what risk are we I don't
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
know maybe this is better offline but I
 
03:40:21.389 --> 03:40:21.399 align:start position:0%
I'm curious
 
03:40:24.389 --> 03:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
about whether you feel like we've
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
adequately covered the opportunity to
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
protect our s from these risks or
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether we we have gaps major gaps that
 
03:40:36.030 --> 03:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
cause people to lose
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
sleep I think that we can always do more
 
03:40:43.110 --> 03:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
right we can always do more um so you
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
know do I feel like we are managing the
 
03:40:48.269 --> 03:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
highest risk I do but do I think that we
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
could do more of course could we do more
 
03:40:54.030 --> 03:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
with a return on
 
03:40:55.750 --> 03:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
investment I
 
03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
mean just higher compliance higher
 
03:41:00.590 --> 03:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
feeling good about ourselves that's all
 
03:41:03.710 --> 03:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
nice but is can we make money with
 
03:41:03.720 --> 03:41:05.030 align:start position:0%
nice but is can we make money with
better

03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
auditing so as a government agency we
 
03:41:09.950 --> 03:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't make money but I think you're
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
referring to maybe saving saving money
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
um can we can we save
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
more you know it it really depends the
 
03:41:22.590 --> 03:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
the good news is most of our providers
 
03:41:24.910 --> 03:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
are doing things right so that is the
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
good news there aren't there aren't
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
loads and loads of instances where we're
 
03:41:31.469 --> 03:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
doing Audits and saying oh you owe us
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
back lots and lots of money and that's a
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
good thing we want that and that's
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
because we are doing lots of work
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
upfront to tell people this is what you
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
need to do as Nathan was referring to
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
when you become a contractor with the
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
state you have to be prepared so no
 
03:41:48.030 --> 03:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
further investment to make more money
 
03:41:51.309 --> 03:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
got it it's it's it's thank you depends
 
03:41:53.349 --> 03:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
on the contractor I'll put it that way
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
all right if you change your mind
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
someday give me a call I
 
03:42:01.710 --> 03:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
will uh so active contract management
 
03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
right another one of the important
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
bullets yes that was from yesterday was
 
03:42:07.229 --> 03:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
um active contract management to ensure
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes this directly relates
 
03:42:12.750 --> 03:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
to one of our road map initiatives so it
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
commitment three is improving customer
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
service and initiative two under that
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
commitment is to improve outcomes for
 
03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents by enhancing the
 
03:42:24.269 --> 03:42:24.279 align:start position:0%
value of the Contracting experience for
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
partnering providers and the people that
 
03:42:26.199 --> 03:42:27.030 align:start position:0%
partnering providers and the people that
they

03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:42:29.389 --> 03:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
serve this initiative is a combined
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
initiative of contracts Bureau contracts
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
quality management which is in my group
 
03:42:35.710 --> 03:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
um and Dave weeders has talked to you
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
about the importance of portfolio
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
management of all of our projects and
 
03:42:40.830 --> 03:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
our our
 
03:42:44.110 --> 03:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
pmo um the head of our pmo project
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
management office St Hobson is on the
 
03:42:48.189 --> 03:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
steering committee with us for this
 
03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
particular initiative so like most of
 
03:42:52.189 --> 03:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
our road map initiatives this is a
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
department-wide effort this is I'm on
 
03:42:56.590 --> 03:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
slide 22 by the way I just want to make
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
sure people are following along um it's
 
03:43:01.469 --> 03:43:01.479 align:start position:0%
a department-wide initiative and I'm
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to highlight just a few of the Del
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
deliverables under this initiative the
 
03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
first deliverable is a contract life
 
03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
cycle management policy which is a huge
 
03:43:15.389 --> 03:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
undertaking to write this policy because
 
03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
people all over the department are
 
03:43:20.149 --> 03:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
involved in any single contract um we
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
are making pretty significant progress
 
03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
I'd say the policy is about 60 to 70%
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
written um which is really important but
 
03:43:29.309 --> 03:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
this is going to enable us to really
 
03:43:31.389 --> 03:43:31.399 align:start position:0%
hone in on every single person's
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
function in the contract management life
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
cycle not just the procurement process
 
03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
but the entire life cycle of a contract
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
what everybody's roles is and what the
 
03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
expectations are uh another deliverable
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
under this particular road map item is
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
is for contracts quality management
 
03:43:50.429 --> 03:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
which is under dpq to make at least one
 
03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
tool available for use related to active
 
03:43:58.030 --> 03:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
contract management for every phase in
 
03:44:00.149 --> 03:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
the active contract management framework
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
and the framework is the visual that you
 
03:44:05.349 --> 03:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
see on the right side of that slide so
 
03:44:08.590 --> 03:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
every step every phase of a contract
 
03:44:11.269 --> 03:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
life cycle is outlined in that Visual
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
and one of our deliverables is to
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
provide some kind of tool to people
 
03:44:17.469 --> 03:44:17.479 align:start position:0%
across the department that they can use
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
for every one of those phases to enhance
 
03:44:21.550 --> 03:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
the way they do active contract
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
management so far I'm happy to report we
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
have tools for the first four um and
 
03:44:31.149 --> 03:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
we're working on a tool for the last one
 
03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
so we do have have those
 
03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
established uh and then the when you
 
03:44:35.680 --> 03:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
established uh and then the when you
meet

03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
tool okay I um I'm I I was doing a quick
 
03:44:44.030 --> 03:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
scan here to see if there's a contract
 
03:44:46.030 --> 03:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
life cycle manager management system in
 
03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
the it portfolio and I I don't see one
 
03:44:52.950 --> 03:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
specifically do you feel like you have
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
adequate workflow support and services
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
within how you're doing life cycle
 
03:45:00.110 --> 03:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
management now we use a number of
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
different items to manage contracts now
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
we certainly use Excel uh people can use
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
Smart sheet we have Smart sheet for
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
project management and many of these
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
contracts are parts of contracts um the
 
03:45:17.790 --> 03:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
you'll hear about Cloud Suite probably
 
03:45:19.070 --> 03:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
yeah Nathan you might want to talk about
 
03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah and the the the state um the
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
the uh contract that the department of
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
administrative Services brought forward
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
to overhaul the existing Erp system to a
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
new system called Cloud Suite um the
 
03:45:36.030 --> 03:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
functionality of that new system May
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
provide us with additional opportunities
 
03:45:41.070 --> 03:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
and may also provide the the vendor or
 
03:45:43.149 --> 03:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
provider Community as well as far as
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
being able to upload documentation into
 
03:45:48.110 --> 03:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
the system that we would have access to
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
to provide better Enterprise management
 
03:45:54.750 --> 03:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
um of everything but I I I think right
 
03:45:56.349 --> 03:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
now that is still in the process of
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
being implemented still trying to
 
03:46:00.309 --> 03:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
understand what it can and can't do but
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities there that that
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
my team and Merida's team are certainly
 
03:46:06.550 --> 03:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
very interested in when we do arrive at
 
03:46:09.229 --> 03:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
that point here uh hopefully in the in
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
the future not too far distant future
 
03:46:14.349 --> 03:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
did did I did I hear you say that's a a
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
state level
 
03:46:18.750 --> 03:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
investigation uh it it's a state level
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
system um that that will uh replace or
 
03:46:24.510 --> 03:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
enhance the New Hampshire first system
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
and does that feel like a four or five
 
03:46:28.750 --> 03:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
year timeline um I I would defer to the
 
03:46:30.630 --> 03:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services I
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
believe the targeted go live date though
 
03:46:35.469 --> 03:46:35.479 align:start position:0%
is this fall of 2025 and I'm more
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
interested in this just because we have
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
so much money flowing through the state
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
to contractors and vendors and and uh I
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
think any productivity we picked up here
 
03:46:48.269 --> 03:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
would be probably useful uh
 
03:46:48.279 --> 03:46:49.750 align:start position:0%
would be probably useful uh
representative

03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you when you enter into a
 
03:46:55.469 --> 03:46:55.479 align:start position:0%
contract uh how do you determine the the
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
capacity of the
 
03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
organization to fulfill what your
 
03:47:00.319 --> 03:47:02.950 align:start position:0%
organization to fulfill what your
expectations

03:47:02.950 --> 03:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
are and when you're thinking of their
 
03:47:07.710 --> 03:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
their capacity I mean that's partly
 
03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
evaluated in their response to our RFP
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
so they're they're submitting a proposal
 
03:47:16.590 --> 03:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
to us saying here's our they'll they'll
 
03:47:18.750 --> 03:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
actually have to list out their capacity
 
03:47:20.349 --> 03:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
in that so they'll have to say these are
 
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
the types of people that are going to be
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
working on this the FTE and what we
 
03:47:27.389 --> 03:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
expect them to be able to produce and
 
03:47:29.309 --> 03:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
we'll use that in our scoring did you
 
03:47:31.510 --> 03:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
have anything to add to that no merus
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
summed it up perfectly B basically when
 
03:47:35.469 --> 03:47:35.479 align:start position:0%
we post an RFP we say we need you to do
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
these specific things they come back to
 
03:47:40.149 --> 03:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
us with a price and they come back to us
 
03:47:42.309 --> 03:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
with the specifications that Meredith uh
 
03:47:43.950 --> 03:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
indicated and then we translate those
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
into the contract
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then and then those become part of
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
the the legally binding agreement thank
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
you course and that would often include
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
a budget of those hours that they've
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
that they've pledged
 
03:47:59.630 --> 03:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
so uh a third deliverable under this
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
particular road map item for the
 
03:48:03.550 --> 03:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
contract life cycle management is to
 
03:48:06.269 --> 03:48:06.279 align:start position:0%
have at least three new contract
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
initiatives that include contracts
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
quality management at the Forefront of
 
03:48:15.790 --> 03:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
the contract planning
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
um you may wonder why why does it matter
 
03:48:20.229 --> 03:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
that we're included at the beginning of
 
03:48:22.269 --> 03:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
the process and it's because that is
 
03:48:25.070 --> 03:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
really where you align the performance
 
03:48:27.990 --> 03:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
metrics with your strategy so when you
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
start thinking about how you are going
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
to craft a contract the types of
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
services that you're going to be
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
procuring the types of people
 
03:48:36.189 --> 03:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
individuals what kind of credentials
 
03:48:37.590 --> 03:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
they need to have how many hours it's
 
03:48:40.510 --> 03:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
going to take that's all your strategy
 
03:48:42.269 --> 03:48:42.279 align:start position:0%
but this is the point at which we want
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
to sit with people and say what are the
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
outcomes that you're actually trying to
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
achieve and once we can have that kind
 
03:48:50.269 --> 03:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
of conversation with them right up at
 
03:48:52.149 --> 03:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
the beginning then we can think about
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
the kinds of performance metrics that
 
03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
should actually belong in the contract
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
and the kind of data that we're going to
 
03:49:00.670 --> 03:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
need to evaluate those performance
 
03:49:04.510 --> 03:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
metrics so you know our our group is
 
03:49:06.750 --> 03:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
relatively new in the department and I
 
03:49:07.870 --> 03:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave anyone with the
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
impression that contracts management has
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
not always been happening it has always
 
03:49:13.349 --> 03:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
been happening there's always been
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
contracts management for every contract
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we do this is just trying to bring
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
some best practice uh into the into the
 
03:49:22.870 --> 03:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
conversation in terms of being able to
 
03:49:24.189 --> 03:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
like I said think hard about the
 
03:49:25.830 --> 03:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
strategy the outcomes that we're trying
 
03:49:27.389 --> 03:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
to achieve and how we're going to
 
03:49:29.950 --> 03:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
measure those so our goal really I think
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
Nathan alluded to this is to be able to
 
03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
work with our vendors in real time to
 
03:49:40.149 --> 03:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
say make sure that we have alignment on
 
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
our shared goals of any contract our
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
shared shared understanding of the
 
03:49:49.469 --> 03:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
deliverables of that particular contract
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
and a shared understanding of the
 
03:49:54.030 --> 03:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes once the contract is complete
 
03:49:56.070 --> 03:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
did that contract work was the strategy
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
successful or was it less successful and
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
we should be able to understand that on
 
03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
the same page as our vendor I I I still
 
03:50:06.990 --> 03:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
have uh two semi significant chunks of
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
things to ask you about that aren't in
 
03:50:12.149 --> 03:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
the slide deck um are are you are you
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
can you about wrap it this up so we can
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
shift a little bit sure yeah absolutely
 
03:50:20.750 --> 03:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I think I'll just note that on the
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
last slide I just highlighted a few a
 
03:50:28.510 --> 03:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
very very tiny number of the types of
 
03:50:30.990 --> 03:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
performance metrics that we look at
 
03:50:32.670 --> 03:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
within the department and I I did that
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
because yesterday I heard Senator
 
03:50:37.469 --> 03:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
Daniels ask how do you measure success
 
03:50:40.110 --> 03:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
and you know our our vision is Optimal
 
03:50:42.830 --> 03:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
Health and well-being for everyone so
 
03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
that's not something we can sum up in a
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
single number as Dr Ballard said
 
03:50:49.229 --> 03:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday there are 300 different
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
measures we use just for Medicaid just
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
for the Medicaid Program just for a
 
03:50:55.790 --> 03:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Managed Care Program uh so we
 
03:50:57.790 --> 03:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
use we have lots and lots of measures
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
that we use and our work in my division
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that those measures are
 
03:51:05.070 --> 03:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
clean meaning the data is clean there
 
03:51:06.910 --> 03:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
are not overlapping numbers there are
 
03:51:09.710 --> 03:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
not uh Missing Fields things that are
 
03:51:11.309 --> 03:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
inaccurate data has to be clean and it
 
03:51:13.630 --> 03:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
has to be meaningful meaning it has to
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
correlate to the thing you are trying to
 
03:51:17.830 --> 03:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually measure so that is some of the
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
work that we do and i' I'd be happy to
 
03:51:22.110 --> 03:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
go into uh more detail on any of that if
 
03:51:22.120 --> 03:51:23.269 align:start position:0%
go into uh more detail on any of that if
it's

03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:51:26.710 --> 03:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
helpful um thank you I'd like to throw
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
um chunk one at you uh and your memory
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
on this is probably better than mine but
 
03:51:33.950 --> 03:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
the first time we kind of talked about
 
03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
um all of this was uh four years ago um
 
03:51:40.910 --> 03:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
maybe longer but I I I asked you to be
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about a a 10-year plan because
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I I I I think it's right that we're
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
working on contract uh metrics first but
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
I but you can't control what you can't
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
measure right and so there's a lot of
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
activity internal to the department that
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see performance metrics
 
03:52:07.990 --> 03:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
around um and and you said at the time
 
03:52:10.429 --> 03:52:10.439 align:start position:0%
offand well it'll probably take us 10
 
03:52:12.750 --> 03:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
years to work towards being able to do
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
that so I'm just curious ious if you're
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
still thinking about that and how are
 
03:52:19.950 --> 03:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
you about building performance metrics
 
03:52:23.710 --> 03:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.389 --> 03:52:25.399 align:start position:0%
department you looked like you were
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
gonna say something sure I I I I think
 
03:52:31.389 --> 03:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
that it's certainly a huge undertaking I
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
I think what's and I think Meredith
 
03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
already alluded to this what's important
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
to understand is because of the diverse
 
03:52:40.349 --> 03:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
array of programs and the various
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
metrics some requirements come from the
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
federal government from you know some
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
like 300 you know 300 performance
 
03:52:51.149 --> 03:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
metrics alone are within the MCO program
 
03:52:53.670 --> 03:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
what what we don't have today is a
 
03:52:56.189 --> 03:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Nexus that draws all those
 
03:52:58.950 --> 03:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
performance metrics together but what we
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
do have I is and this is part of the
 
03:53:03.389 --> 03:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner's vision and the road map
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
is we have clear priorities around what
 
03:53:09.790 --> 03:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
we want to put our resources towards
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
towards the goals that we want to
 
03:53:13.550 --> 03:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
achieve in the coming year and and the
 
03:53:16.229 --> 03:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
road map has been set up in that way in
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
in a way that we're going to be
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
reviewing that constantly it's not a
 
03:53:21.429 --> 03:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
5year plan sometimes you see strategic
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
planning happen someone comes with a
 
03:53:24.309 --> 03:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
5-year plan it goes in a box everybody
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
forgets about it and somebody dusts it
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
off seven years later and says oh what's
 
03:53:29.469 --> 03:53:29.479 align:start position:0%
this the road map is something that's
 
03:53:32.229 --> 03:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
actively being manag within with the pmo
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
resources and the p and the project
 
03:53:35.790 --> 03:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
management system that Dave was talking
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
about earlier and we're having regular
 
03:53:40.469 --> 03:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
meetings regular updates to make sure
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
that we can be successful with those
 
03:53:44.590 --> 03:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
things now that's not exactly what what
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
you're referring to uh chairman Edwards
 
03:53:50.830 --> 03:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
I I I believe but but the the current
 
03:53:53.229 --> 03:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
state as far as having a team of
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
individuals that would analyze
 
03:53:57.750 --> 03:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive data across the department
 
03:54:01.070 --> 03:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
in a unified way that that that does not
 
03:54:04.229 --> 03:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
exist but we do have specific areas that
 
03:54:06.510 --> 03:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
are looking at their areas very closely
 
03:54:08.670 --> 03:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
and measuring that on a daily basis and
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
so the example I could give you that we
 
03:54:13.110 --> 03:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
talked about today is the contracts unit
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're measuring how long does it take
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
to get from X to Y you know what what
 
03:54:19.149 --> 03:54:19.159 align:start position:0%
what's the volume what's the type what
 
03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
can we do to make that better that's
 
03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
happening across the department and the
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
road map is really our attempt to try to
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
unify the entire department towards one
 
03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
or not one goal but a m a multi set of
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
goals um in a comprehensive way but
 
03:54:36.750 --> 03:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
what's also really important there is
 
03:54:38.670 --> 03:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to drive that to drive
 
03:54:41.630 --> 03:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
culture and to drive purpose
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
because everybody knows we're going into
 
03:54:45.309 --> 03:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
a challenging but everybody already
 
03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
knows that we're already under a hiring
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
freeze people have options right now
 
03:54:50.830 --> 03:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
they have options to choose where they
 
03:54:54.189 --> 03:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
want to work and if you don't have an
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
organization that has a good culture and
 
03:54:58.349 --> 03:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
a good place and you don't understand
 
03:55:00.429 --> 03:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
your purpose in that then that may not
 
03:55:02.229 --> 03:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
be a place that people want to work and
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to make sure that HHS
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
is the place that people want to work
 
03:55:08.349 --> 03:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the unifying drive but again
 
03:55:11.070 --> 03:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
I realize that's not quite what you're
 
03:55:13.229 --> 03:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
looking for as far as that performance
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
metric but but that's very important as
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
far as our priorities go um towards
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
towards the upcoming budget
 
03:55:23.149 --> 03:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
conversations I so I actually think you
 
03:55:25.870 --> 03:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
got pretty close to answering what I'm
 
03:55:28.830 --> 03:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm kind of looking for I the
 
03:55:30.910 --> 03:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the commissioner is using the
 
03:55:33.309 --> 03:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
Strategic road map to manage the entire
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
department and as I look at the
 
03:55:37.870 --> 03:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
Strategic road map as impressed as I am
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
with it I I I can't help but to look at
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
it and go okay what are the what are the
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
key performance metrics or indicators to
 
03:55:48.389 --> 03:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
know if we're accomplishing that
 
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
component of the road map what I think I
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
just heard you say though is that
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
although I may not be seeing them the
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
pmo has some set of set metrics that
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
they're monitoring regularly and I'm
 
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
guessing that in the individual uh uh
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
performance evaluations you have kpis
 
03:56:11.870 --> 03:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
for individual Behavior to reinforce
 
03:56:14.429 --> 03:56:14.439 align:start position:0%
their support for the road map so you
 
03:56:17.229 --> 03:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
got maybe at least two metrics I'm not
 
03:56:18.630 --> 03:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
trying to put words in your mouth I'm
 
03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
just trying to say what I think I
 
03:56:24.429 --> 03:56:24.439 align:start position:0%
understand yeah I I mean there there are
 
03:56:26.790 --> 03:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
systems upon systems in in any
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
organization and we try to make sure
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
that our our our sjds are the
 
03:56:32.590 --> 03:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
supplemental job description it's
 
03:56:34.510 --> 03:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
basically someone's job description
 
03:56:36.149 --> 03:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
against which we annually measure
 
03:56:38.830 --> 03:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
performance align with the Align with
 
03:56:40.590 --> 03:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
the bureau's goal and the bureau aligns
 
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
with the division goal and the division
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
goals are consistent with stat statute
 
03:56:47.550 --> 03:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
and the and the requirements upon us so
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
so that's all great so then my ask then
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
is if you could find a simple way to
 
03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
communicate to me which metrics you're
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
using to to measure the key components
 
03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
of the road map i' I'd like to I I know
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do I just would
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
like a better idea of when have we
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
arrived or what does success look like
 
03:57:12.510 --> 03:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
with this sure U and I I'm not looking
 
03:57:15.630 --> 03:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
to reinvent all your wheel but if
 
03:57:18.389 --> 03:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
there's already a way to just expose
 
03:57:21.389 --> 03:57:21.399 align:start position:0%
that i' I'd appreciate that and if I can
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
just add and when we spoke all those
 
03:57:27.309 --> 03:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
years ago Mr chair and and still
 
03:57:30.189 --> 03:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
today much of what we do at the
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
department is Project based because
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
things are changing constantly so every
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
year 400 New pieces of legislation come
 
03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
out impacting the department so it's not
 
03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
as though you know we have in contracts
 
03:57:45.309 --> 03:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
we do have some dedicated staff who are
 
03:57:46.469 --> 03:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
actually just doing the same thing
 
03:57:48.030 --> 03:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
they're producing contracts constantly
 
03:57:49.149 --> 03:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
they're producing contracts that come
 
03:57:50.790 --> 03:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
out of a lot of that legislation a lot
 
03:57:53.110 --> 03:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the program area staff though you
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
know every July now have a whole new
 
03:57:57.550 --> 03:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
slate of things that they need to do so
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
each project has a different way to
 
03:58:02.830 --> 03:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
measure success and and it's often
 
03:58:05.389 --> 03:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
related to time is the way that we you
 
03:58:06.670 --> 03:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
know evaluate whether or not there's
 
03:58:08.309 --> 03:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
success of that so there's some kind of
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
deadline we need to accomplish something
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
by did we do it or did we not do it and
 
03:58:13.830 --> 03:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
and those are kind of the metrics that
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
we have have to use in order to to know
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not we were successful in
 
03:58:20.670 --> 03:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
achieving what we were mandated to
 
03:58:24.550 --> 03:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
do all right committee questions any
 
03:58:24.560 --> 03:58:25.550 align:start position:0%
do all right committee questions any
committee

03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:58:29.269 --> 03:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
questions anyone from the audience
 
03:58:32.910 --> 03:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
feeling like they need to get up and say
 
03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
something um I have um uh
 
03:58:41.950 --> 03:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
256 um so so what have we determined
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
today I I think we've determined that
 
03:58:47.229 --> 03:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
you all have uh done a lot of good work
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd like another bite at the
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
Apple at looking at the it systems um
 
03:58:56.030 --> 03:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
and if you if you all could come back
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
with some sort of uh you know
 
03:59:03.309 --> 03:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately scaled U visual for me to
 
03:59:06.189 --> 03:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
understand how we know the Strategic
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
road map what does success look like and
 
03:59:12.030 --> 03:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that'll come intuitively to
 
03:59:14.510 --> 03:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
you but I I just I just feel like I need
 
03:59:17.070 --> 03:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
something to know if if we're
 
03:59:17.080 --> 03:59:18.670 align:start position:0%
something to know if if we're
succeeding

03:59:18.670 --> 03:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
succeeding
 
03:59:22.189 --> 03:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
um um I that's all that's that those are
 
03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
the two big takeaways I have uh do you
 
03:59:28.469 --> 03:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
have anything that you feel compelled
 
03:59:32.149 --> 03:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
to correct or modify or no no we
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time with the committee
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh and uh look forward to spending many
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
many more days here oh okay uh well
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
three minutes early we're going to
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:12.960 --> 04:00:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
all

04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
