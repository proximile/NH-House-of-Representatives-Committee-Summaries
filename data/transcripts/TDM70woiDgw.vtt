yes um thank you for the record my name
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
is Senator Tom Sherman I represent
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
District 24 which is 11 towns on the Sea
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
Coast um and I'm introducing
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
sb21 it's a very straightforward
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
correction of Statute uh and this story
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
is that in
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
2019 the Greenland house delegation
 
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
brought forward HB
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
243 which would have added uh an
 
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
additional member to the peas
 
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
Development Authority uh board of
 
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
directors um that would have actually it
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
it would have meant changing the size of
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
the board and was felt by the board to
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
potentially be somewhat
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
disruptive and in in a compromise on the
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
Senate side we were able to agree to
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth giving up half of a
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
representative and letting Greenland
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
have that half so rather than changing
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
the size of the PDA board it simply um
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
replaced one half of portsmouth's
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
representation and so there would be a
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
shared representative from Newington and
 
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.950 align:start position:0%
shared representative from Newington and
Greenland

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
Greenland
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh and it wasn't caught
 
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 align:start position:0%
until the governor was about to sign the
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh in redrafting with the amendment
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
the original language of the bill that
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
changed the size of the PDA board and
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
the subsequent
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
Quorum um was not eliminated from the
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
the bill so with the understanding that
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
we would be filing the correction in
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
20120 the governor went ahead and signed
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
the bill the effective date of the
 
00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.909 align:start position:0%
the bill the effective date of the
original

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
bill um is not until next month uh which
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
is April 30th
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
2021 so nothing was going to happen to
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
the peas Development Authority board
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
until the end of April of this
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
year uh and so I filed SB
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
592 uh last year which was a victim of
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
covid it was uh of course felt to be
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
very important because we had to correct
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
that Quorum requirement otherwise the
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
board would not be able to
 
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
board would not be able to
function

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
um when it was tabled it was then
 
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
incorporated into one of the Omnibus
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
bills and you may remember I can't
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
remember the exact number of that
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill but it was massive and it
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
was all administrative Corrections uh
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
vetoed um so we are left still needing
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
to make that simple correction this is a
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
very very short bill um it makes the
 
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
correction in the Quorum requirement by
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
repealing the part of the bill from 2019
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
that should not have been in there um as
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh you and I have discussed Madam chair
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the uh Senate expedited this with a
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
goal of trying to get this in front of
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
the governor before the end of April so
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
that uh the quum require M will not
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
impact the board in any kind of negative
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
way so I would appreciate the support of
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
the committee um and expedited executive
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
action so that this could go uh to the
 
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
full um to the Full House and to the
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
governor's desk uh with a goal of
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
getting it there before the original
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
Bill had any impact and um I'm happy to
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%

page there that goes there and if you go
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
on to page two line 15 is a new
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph that requires the
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
uh the fiscal committee to be involved
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
according to normal procedures if the
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:06.460 align:start position:0%
$100,000 also extra
 
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:14.470 align:start position:0%
$100,000 also extra

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
question are there any uh questions
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
discussion yes I wish to be heard
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative goalie got there
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
first and then representative Schmidt
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
chair represent goalie thank you madam
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
chair uh I will be supporting this
 
00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:42.789 align:start position:0%
chair uh I will be supporting this
amendment

00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
um well I don't believe we really needed
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
to touch the uh Governor's declared
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
state of emergency portion because it
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
could be um removed at any time with a
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
house concur with a concurrent
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
resolution um I think this is a a good
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
compromise knowing that
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
um executive order should be the balance
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
of power should be in check with the
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
governor's executive orders um during a
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and um by extending
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh the state of emergency out to 30 days
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
it makes it more
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable um also I think it's very
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
important that the fiscal committee have
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
a look and they say on how money coming
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
in uh is spent especially as we saw in
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh tens of millions of dollars
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
coming into the state um I believe the
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh joint fiscal committee should be
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
looking at those dollars and uh making
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
sure they're spent wisely uh so with
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
these changes I I will uh support the
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you thank you
 
00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:50.029 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you thank you
representative

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
chair um as I have said before and I
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
continue to assert uh this is premature
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
we are not going to be um affecting the
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
current situation which is the cause of
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
the con of the consternation on the part
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
of some portion of our
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
population uh and it it a 30-day renewal
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
process is um sounds workable but in in
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
many cases uh it won't be necessary uh
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
because most emergencies are quite time
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
Limited and either Regional or local and
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh it this would be unnecessary in in
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
those types of situations uh to call the
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislature in to renew it because it's
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
going to take another week or 10 days is
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
a waste of everyone's effort time and
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
and expense H and uh in the case of a
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
situation such as we currently face or
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
in Thea event of a potential nuclear
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
emergency at seab Brook um the the time
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
frame would be uh uh unknowable in
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
length uh and uh what we should be doing
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
is retaining this this bill to work on
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
it uh because I don't think that this
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
methodology is workable or necessary in
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
most circumstances and and unworkable in
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
a true emergency of the nature we
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
currently confront so I'll be voting no
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
um and opposing it on the house floor as
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative font
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
now thank you madam chair um I guess
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance or inexperience on
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
this I'm just trying to clarify on the
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
page two paragraph 15 uh regarding
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
acceptance of any federal uh private or
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
other Grant and exceeds $100,000 does
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
this also
 
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.029 align:start position:0%
this also
clarify

00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
that uh Finance
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee a fiscal
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
committee approval for expenditures of
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
those funds after they've been that
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
represent font no that is in RSA 1430 D
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
Roman 6 it's part of their normal
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
procedure um so it doesn't need to be
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
specified here thank
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
you okay representative
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
legro we're sitting smack in the middle
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
of precedent that that's pertinent to
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
this bill so to suggest that it's not
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
needed because most
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies won't require the measures
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
in this bill I I don't understand so I
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
will be supporting this
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh in light of possibility of
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
future emergencies similar to this
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
one thank you anyone else I'd like to
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
say something that the the the reason
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we can the reason that the initial
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
state of emergency is extended to 30
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
days rather than 21 is to make sure that
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
we don't get involved in the sort of
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
routine weather related emergencies we
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
don't need to be involved we don't want
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
to be involved and it and they're almost
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
entirely over by 30 days um so I think
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
we can that addresses that issue and
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
regard to not necessary this is the
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
first emergency that has required this
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
sort of extensions and what it did is
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
that it showed some of the weaknesses in
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
the current statute that that allows the
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
governor to accept hundreds of millions
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
of dollars with no
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
oversight all right so that's that's a
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
concern some of the executive orders
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
were felt by many people as excessive
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
and there was no oversight so all all
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
that the legislature had was the blunt
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
Hammer of saying we'll end the state of
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
emergency and that was not not feasible
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
we could have done it when we met in May
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
and June but would it wouldn't have been
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
effective because most people felt that
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
we were in emergency what no matter how
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
many of the executive orders they
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
disagreed with they couldn't say there
 
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
was no emergency at that time so this
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
gives the legislature the policymaking
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
form of government the authority to be
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
more nuanced and deal with the executive
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
orders one at a time rather than you
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
know just totally in the state of
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
emergency and so I think this is a good
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
start we have already retained House
 
00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:50.909 align:start position:0%
start we have already retained House
Bill

00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
275 to see if there are other issues
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed this simply
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
deals with the
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
oversight okay we have some more
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
to representative fontel that at our
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
previous discussion of the former
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment proposed to this bill we had
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
asked for for just a cross reference to
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
that statute for the fiscal committee
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
out thank you representative Roy thank
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
um the reason I I crafted this build the
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
primary U purpose for it or at least
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
driving factor of me was my inability to
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
answer my constituents as to what was
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
um you know the governor passed a lot of
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
orders some people agreed some people
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
disagree that's really here nor there
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
for this but the problem was is lack of
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
communication I don't know about the
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
rest of you but I found out about a lot
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
of these things the same way my
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
constituents did um when it came out in
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
the news and they would call me or write
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
me and say hey what's what's this about
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to say I have no idea um
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
now as this goes on for a year you know
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
30 days it is what it is but when we get
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
into six seven eight nine months and all
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
I can say is I don't know um that's not
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
my job as a representative to represent
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
the people in government we have to be
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
able to at least give them answers and
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
know what is going on um having
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
oversight is even better but just as a
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
starting point to be able to answer my
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
constituents what is happening to them
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
and why to me is of utmost importance so
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair I I have I
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
just would like a clarification and it's
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
about the um the change that's on the
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
first page so what would happen if the
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
met but in one
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
chamber you know voted in the majority
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
to are they supposed to vote to continue
 
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.269 align:start position:0%
to are they supposed to vote to continue
or

00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
to um terminate and this they can vote
 
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.310 align:start position:0%
to um terminate and this they can vote
to

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
under this amendment representative
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
fellows the vote is to continue the
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and if either house
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
voted no it would not
 
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
continue thank you that was what I was
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
out representative lacus yes following
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
on to what representative Roy said
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
um after the 30 days that the
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
legislature gets involved in reviewing
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
the executive orders even even if the
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
legislature approves every one of them
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
at least they are representing their
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
constituents and you know having
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
presumably people will come and testify
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
and there'll be a possibility for um the
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
public to comment on them uh you know
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
the one for meeting like any other
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
hearing Le that's a possibility and the
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
legislature has an I think an
 
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.549 align:start position:0%
legislature has an I think an
obligation

00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
as to be involved in the process and
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
represent the people and we haven't been
 
00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
year anyone
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
else I just might mention to
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt that I would not
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
let the perfect be the enemy of the good
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
in this case as the chair has pointed
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
out we're retaining a bill that can
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
amend uh or address concerns that you
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
might think of in the mean uh so I've
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
listened to what you said and that's my
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
thought about it thank you
 
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.789 align:start position:0%
thought about it thank you
representative

00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair well first
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
of all I I want to state that I concur
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
with uh several of the previous speakers
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
that uh the the handling of this pre
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
present situation has not been uh
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
without flaws uh and the the
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
disregarding of the joint fiscal
 
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.389 align:start position:0%
disregarding of the joint fiscal
committee

00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
uh rightful uh involvement in the
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
dispersement of funds acceptance of
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
funds and so forth is a particularly
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
egregious example of that a number of
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
the executive orders that the governor
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
has issued uh also have caused a lot of
 
00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039 align:start position:0%
consternation uh among a lot of us uh
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of transparency and
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
so forth so I don't dispute that there
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
is cause for the legislature to uh to
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
look into this but but th this bill will
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
not impact the current situation where
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
the governor has acted uh somewhat
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
high-handedly in my opinion uh and I I
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that the legislature
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
should be involved in amending the
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
current statutory situation it's just
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill does nothing to curb the
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
governor's uh potential abuse of uh of
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
his powers uh in the current
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
circumstance um and there for uh it it
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
does not remedy the the the current
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
situation uh and it's unlikely that we
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
could pass a bill that would do that uh
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances so I'm all in favor of
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
making a number of changes but I would
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
like to get much more involvement of
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
other committees uh and the other body
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh so I'm I'm not hostile
 
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
to any of those objectives it's just a
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
we don't accomplish it with this bill um
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
and some of the current C some of the
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
current fixes uh I think are not that
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
workable and they they deserve further
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
deliberation and greater involvement
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
than we can give it under these current
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
time constraints so I respect my
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues positions on this but but I
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
think that uh that this bill is um is
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
not not that workable uh and it doesn't
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
resolve the current problems with the
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
governor's maintenance of his of his
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
Vera thank you madam chair I think that
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is a good
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
start and I'll be supporting this
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
amendment um I particularly like the
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
fact that if we can't meet the executive
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
orders continues in 14 day 14-day
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
increment which seems to me very
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable um I do like the um well like
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
is not the right word I support the um
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
involvement of the
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
legislature actually the governor's
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
Council in um the fiscal responsibility
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
that the governor has when it comes to
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
um accepting
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
money and um I do like the fact that um
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
if um in every place that there's
 
00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:34.549 align:start position:0%
if um in every place that there's
legislative

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
a contingency if we can't meet so I
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
think that this is an improvement of
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
what we had we didn't know what we we
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
really didn't know what we needed until
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
we were put in this
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
position and now we have something to
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
use hopefully we won't need to use it
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
but it will give us a um it'll give us
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
more guidance than what we have now so I
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate the bill the amendment and I
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
will support it thank you representative
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
laus and then representative
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
fellos um so I'd like to address repres
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
the first point representative Schmidt
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
brought up um and I have to agree with
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
him uh entirely I would like to see
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
something done to get the legislature
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
more involved now um I think the effect
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
date of this was selected because there
 
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
were concerns the governor would veto a
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
bill that interfered with the current
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
state of emergency if that weren't an
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
issue I would certainly uh you know want
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
the uh effective date to be up fun
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
passage so at this point there's nothing
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
we can do about the current state of
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
emergency unless we're willing to
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
support um hcr2 which would completely
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
end it but that's a separate
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
discussion and as the second point I
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
don't see why it's not working I mean
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
there could
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
be you know if you think about what's
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
happened over the last year there were
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
certainly periods where the
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
legislature you know maybe it could have
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
met maybe not but you some of the times
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
given the knowledge of the time we
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
probably would not have met we probably
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
would have thought we could not meet and
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
this deals with that I mean you know
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
emergency could be extended if the
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
governor wanted 14 days at a time but so
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
I mean but we have met over the last
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
year so certainly there were
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the legislature to
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
review and either approve or not
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
approve um you know the emergency orders
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
and you know if this was had been in
 
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
place if nothing else I think the
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
governor would have had more open
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
discussions with the legislature about
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
what he wanted to do because you know we
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
would have had the ability to
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
um we would have actually had to approve
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
if we to meet the emergency orders and
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
he would have known that and I think
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
there would have been uh you know more
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
discussion and more feedback you know
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not we actually chose to meet
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know or not
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
so while Surly there there could be
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances we could meet and that
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't anticipates it I don't see if the
 
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
amendment all right in that case the
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%

say like us I
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
agree all right since the it's probably
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
because the amendment replaces the
 
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.950 align:start position:0%
because the amendment replaces the
entire

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
Bill all right um in that case anyone
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
else wish to
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
speak Adam chair I will just say thank
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
you for making it clear who's making the
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
motions GL to help representative
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair uh one
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
aspect that I did not address in the uh
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
remarks on the amendment is that uh
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
we've had uh to my knowledge no input
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office uh or from
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
the other body or from uh the public uh
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that we are not
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
changing the current situation at all um
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
this is premature and we should go at
 
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
this hammer and tongues because uh I the
 
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
fact that that the bill might have a
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
number of very good Provisions in it and
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
I agree with them um I still think the
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
workability issue it's like a a table
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
that has three good legs and one bad leg
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that the three good legs are
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
are fine won't keep the taable standing
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
up if there if the bad leg fails so
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
there there doesn't have to be a total
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
unworkability in order for the bill to
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
not be functional and and I think we
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
need more involvement for more people
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
and more expertise in order to come up
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
with all the changes that need to be
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
made and therefore I will vote against
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended uh for the same
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
reason I oppose the
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%

00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
will phrase my U my Minority Report I'm
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
asking this for the sake of the form I
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
don't think you have to answer but it
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
would be nice if you did actually
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you could your
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
choices are to recommend ought to pass
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
without the amendment or itl because
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
retain is not an acceptable motion on
 
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.990 align:start position:0%
retain is not an acceptable motion on
the

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
floor okay well that would have been my
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
preference but I appre appreciate the
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
clar ification in that case I will
 
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.510 align:start position:0%
clar ification in that case I will
recommend

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
is relative to the r ra ification of
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
amendments to the State Building Code um
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
this bill ratifies certain amendments to
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
the state building code and the state
 
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.950 align:start position:0%
the state building code and the state
fire

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
fire
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
code Madam chair um this bill um has
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
been around for at least a year um as
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know uh they can't the uh the board
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
cannot ratify amendments without getting
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislative approval and there was a
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
bill last year that passed uh house Edna
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
and it came to the Senate and
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
and we uh we ceased operations and so
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
what ended up happening it got put into
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
one of the Omnibus bills which was House
 
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.470 align:start position:0%
one of the Omnibus bills which was House
Bill

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
1234 which we know was vetoed by the
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
governor so uh this year I filed um
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 15 we do know that they need
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
to get these amendments adopted they're
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
long overdue and again that's why uh you
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
have this bill today so at this point I
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
will uh
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh stop talking and uh be more than
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator are there questions
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
representative laus uh thank you mad
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
chair I don't know if this is best uh
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
answered by the senator by you and my
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
question is how do these changes relate
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
to the bill that we heard earlier that
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
seemed to be on a similar topic Senate
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 15 is identical to House Bill 72 as
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
submitted it does not include the
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that that we passed to House
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 72 and if this were to go forward
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
we would have to incorporate that plus
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
other additions that I believe Marshall
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Senator
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning Madam chair
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
Paul paresi and it is my privilege to
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
serve as the State Fire Marshall and uh
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
I am here this morning in support of
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 15 the ratification of the
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
Amendments for the state and building uh
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
State Fire and and building codes um as
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson pointed out this was
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
brought forward last year in in House
 
00:45:52.359 --> 00:45:53.230 align:start position:0%
brought forward last year in in House
Bill

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
1234 um unfortunately that that was
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor um but it it was
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know I think it held support both in
 
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
the in the house and the Senate with
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
relative to um how the uh the both the
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
chambers looked at this the um the the
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
Amendments that the board of Fire
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
Control do um or pass um expire after 12
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
months if they're not ratified by the
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
general court so what the board of Fire
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
Control did this past de December was
 
00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
Control did this past de December was
they

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
ratified the Amendments that they had
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
previously uh adopted so that they would
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
be fresh and still in play for you to uh
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
ratify uh this legislative session so um
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
as representative McGuire pointed out we
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
would suggest a an amendment which
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
essentially uh mirrors the amendment
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
that um you folks uh did to House Bill
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
72 which would Encompass the four
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
exhibits that the board of Fire Control
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh took under consideration and uh
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
passed um this past December and was uh
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
approved by the commissioner of safety
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
in January and those are exhibits
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
20-45 uh
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
20055 20615 and
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
20715 and then as uh representative
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
Maguire also pointed out I believe that
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
um there has been interest in on the
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
building code side to adopt uh what I
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
believe is called appendix Q which uh
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
deals with tiny houses because the
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
building code uh nor the building code
 
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
nor the fire code really address tiny
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
houses right now so that's all I have uh
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd be certainly happy to
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
answer any questions yes representative
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
Schmidt has a
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and good
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
morning Marshall uh I didn't quite get
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
my hand up quickly enough to ask the
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
question of Senator Carson and I believe
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
she has left the meeting at the
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
at this point uh but are you aware
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
whether the Senate is uh on board with
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
the changes that you just referenced uh
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
that we made to our bill uh which
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
improved it in my opinion um and the
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
question is whether uh it's the Senate
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
has any knowledge of it um and has taken
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
any position on it uh even
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently thank you for the question
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schmidt I don't
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
believe they've taken it up yet so I I
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't offer an opinion okay
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I can help you
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
with that thank you 72 has not yet
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
passed the house with the amendment I
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
have SP I have spoken
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
to Senator Carson and Senator Reagan and
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
others who are been involved in building
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
code issues in the past they support the
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendment they also support the
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
additional amendment to add section Quee
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
on Tiny Houses I don't know how
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
widespread that support is but at least
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
some people have expressed support well
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much because I think
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
that's very important that we that we
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
wind up with a successful bill this time
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh hoping that the governor will not
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
veto this one uh and um so thank you for
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
your efforts already on this and let's
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%

sent although I haven't yet looked at
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
them in detail is the uh the changes
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
requested related to tiny houses one of
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you for the question uh
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative they are not um we that
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
was something that's coming up under the
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh the building code review board and an
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that they would they would uh
 
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.349 align:start position:0%
amendment that they would they would uh
be

00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:53.559 align:start position:0%
proposing yes um could we get a copy of
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
that sent to the committee I'd like to
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
see it before we exact
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
this I believe that the building CO
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
review board can provide it I'll ask
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
you right representative
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you this is a question of the
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
chair um since we don't actually have a
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
proposal yet regarding the tiny houses
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
is it the plan of the chair to hold this
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill until such time as we may have
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
that uh I think that's one thing we
 
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.549 align:start position:0%
that uh I think that's one thing we
could

00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
do Senator Carson and I agreed that one
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
of the bills will be amended to contain
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
all of the pieces and sent to the
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
governor and the other one will be
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
retained in committee whether our
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
committee or
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
hers to pick up any further changes this
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
year and uh or in case of emergency
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
but but we definitely want to get one
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
bill and send it to the governor without
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
it being in an Omnibus containing
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
elements that that could be
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
needed right understandable so so you'll
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
just be working with Senator Carson to
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
see uh which Bill suits the timing the
 
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.349 align:start position:0%
see uh which Bill suits the timing the
best

00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%

discussions relating to building and

fire code amendments as they've been
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
processed through the building code
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
review board and the State's Fire
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
Control Board and I agree with the
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
procedural history provided by Senator
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
Carson and uh Fire Marshall perzy that
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
this subject matter was well pawed
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
through in the past and it uh
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh was a victim of an
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Gathering of other subject
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
matter um we would also support uh the
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to the uh to the more recent
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
exhibit amendments to the fire code as
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
the Fire Marshall had referenced and
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
also the an amendment to add reference
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
to appendix Q uh of the uh International
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
residential code uh those are all
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
matters that our association have
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
supported and just by way of explanation
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
exhibit Q or appendix Q is uh a document
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
that relates to newer versions of the
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
code than is what is now in place and
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
adopted in New Hampshire and it would
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
fill a void for the 2015 code to bring
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
that appendix forward and make it part
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
of our operating code here in the state
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
and so that's why uh that subject matter
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
is coming forward as a separate matter
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
and as an amendment so we would support
 
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
all of the above and appreciate your
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
your time
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%

this is an example of the kind of
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
serious and uh fruitful work that this
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee can uh produce and especially
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
your efforts in staying on top of the
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
differences between what we've already
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
adopted in this committee and but hasn't
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
gone through the house yet and what the
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
Senate is bringing us uh this is uh very
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
important and you see the support of not
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
only attorney Pollock but the fire
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%

is Sharon Carson and I have the pleasure
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
of representing Senate District 14
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
comprising The Town of London da Hudson
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
and Auburn and I have for your
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
consideration this morning Senate Bill
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
106 which deals with um adopting Omnibus
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
legislation related to codes um there
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
are two parts of this bill the first is
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
repealing the voluntary fire service
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
equipment certification and the second
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
is establishing a committee to study
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
adopting changes to the State Fire and
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
Building Codes um Madam chair how would
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
you like me to proceed would you like me
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
to just uh talk about the first part of
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
the bill and and uh and then allow T
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
other testimony and then continue on to
 
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
part two or would you like me to do them
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
both at the same time I think for
 
01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
purposes of our understanding we rather
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
do it section by
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
section position to you but on the
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
bigger omnibuses but it will help us a
 
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
great deal not a problem Madam chair
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
Okay so so the first bill the first uh
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
the first one's fairly easy um the
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
repealing the voluntary fire service
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
equipment certification this bill uh was
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
filed at the request of the State Fire
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
Marshal's office and I believe um the
 
01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshall is here to uh discuss with
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
you why he wanted this uh legislation
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
filed and with that with that I will
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and go back into
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%

chair members of the committee again my
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
name is Paul paresi and I am still the
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal and uh I am here in
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
support of uh house correction Senate
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 106 part one which repeals the
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
voluntary fire service equipment
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
certification program this program uh
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
was established under Senate Bill 355
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
back in 2004 and went into effect on
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
January 1st of
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
2005 uh the program was initially uh
 
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
established to encourage service
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
technicians who are installing and
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
servicing Fire Equipment such as fire
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
alarm systems sprinkler systems and so
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
forth to be certified in New Hampshire
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
and in order to be certified they would
 
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
have to prove proficiency through an
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
outside credentialing agency such as the
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
National Institute of certification and
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
engineering technology or net uh the
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
International Code Council which is ICC
 
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh they would had to have uh been a
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
current professional engineer or
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
something similar and it would it was
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
envisioned that someday this program
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
would become uh mandatory and then it
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
would tighten up the Fly by Night actors
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
in the business who are not sufficiently
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
trained or educated to conduct these
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
operations the program was originally uh
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
had an advisory committee uh that was
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
established to assist the commissioner
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
in rulemaking requirements uh the
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee was repealed uh under
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 1690 in 2010 and since
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
then the law has remained unchanged as
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
had the administrative rules which were
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
safe C
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
,00 uh in 2019 we began reviewing uh the
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
possibility of re roping uh safy 1200
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
and we conducted an analysis of the
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
program and and uh determined that there
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
were fewer than 20 participants in the
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
program and the revenue was under $1,000
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
annually we contacted various
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the trade uh as well as
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
fire service folks and uh we came to the
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
conclusion that there was little value
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
in keeping the uh voluntary program we
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
do uh think that there's value in
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
someday bringing it back uh as a
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
mandatory program if all of the
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are in agreement to do so
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
so with that uh we Advocate that we uh
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
that you repeal the program under uh RSA
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
1535 a and I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.629 align:start position:0%
1535 a and I'd be happy to answer any
questions

01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
O'Brien uh thank you madam chair um
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Fire Marshall for taking my
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
question maybe it isn't relevant but I
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
would appreciate your
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
explanation in the case that a
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
vendor uh in some municipalities has to
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
be certified by that particular fire
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
alarm division in order to access the
 
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
municipal own fire box place it on
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
manual go in and work on the system
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
within the timely fashion by you know
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
the code and everything and uh replace
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
the box back on from manual back on to
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
automatic this does nothing to alleviate
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
the responsibility do they still have to
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
notify farm that they're in Municipal
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
equipment that they're uh isolated that
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
box and made it from automatic to uh
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
manual so therefore the uh proper trans
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
mission of alarm would be generated as
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
what the intention of the fire alarm
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
panel is to
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
do thank you very much for the question
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative O'Brien and yes
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
this would have nothing to do with what
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities or local fire departments
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
require of their uh service technicians
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
or vendors to work specifically on fire
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
alarm or sprinkler systems or other
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
fixed Fire Protection Systems within
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
their community so uh NASA for instance
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
Salem there's uh manest there's a lot of
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of departments have what's called
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
a certificate of fitness program which
 
01:18:01.229 --> 01:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
is uh allowed under the state fire code
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
now those municipalities can continue to
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
have those programs this would just
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um good
 
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
morning Marshall pesi uh you mentioned
 
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
that the original provision uh was put
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
into um I don't know what I don't recall
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
the word you used oversee or investigate
 
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.750 align:start position:0%
the word you used oversee or investigate
Bad

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
Bad
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
actors um who were doing these kinds of
 
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
things without uh proper knowledge so
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
are you not seeing any evidence of
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
people doing that uh recently
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.910 align:start position:0%
people doing that uh recently
or

01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative I I think that there will
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
always be folks out there that are doing
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
things that they shouldn't be doing um
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
what this does is it it it leaves it to
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to really enforce
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
that so um a local fire department for
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
instance if they don't have a
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
certificate of fitness program uh which
 
01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
we encourage them to do but if they
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
don't have one then they would need to
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
work with their uh local uh law
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency to uh bring forward
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh some sort of charge uh to to someone
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
who's doing something that they
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be to a fire alarm system uh
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
under the state fire code which they can
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
they can certainly do but as far as um
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
we don't we haven't had a when we
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
contacted the fire chiefs regarding this
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
issue we didn't hear them uh say that
 
01:19:48.629 --> 01:19:48.639 align:start position:0%
this was going to be a detriment and
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't you know that there were
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
so many uh folks out there not doing a
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
good good job that it was going to be a
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
problem and it was voluntary anyway
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
really the only thing that would have
 
01:19:59.550 --> 01:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
teeth is if it was a mandatory program
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
side thank you representative fellows
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my question has
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
to do with the small towns the ones that
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't even have that don't have maybe
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
full-time um fire departments and if
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
this would perhaps negatively impact the
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
safety in those
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
communities I'm wondering who who is
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
doing the work on these um fire alarm
 
01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.550 align:start position:0%
doing the work on these um fire alarm
systems

01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
and if the small really small fire
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
departments are not going to I'm I'm
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
just thinking that somebody works on on
 
01:20:49.229 --> 01:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
a fire alarm panel the people who are in
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
that building think that it works fine
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe it doesn't because the people
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
who worked on it don't know what they
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
were doing so who who is doing this work
 
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
and to what extent are people not
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
qualified to do
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the question
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative and it's certainly a fair
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
question um so um right now even with
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
this law in place nothing is nothing
 
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
prevents anybody from just going in and
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
conducting that kind of uh work let's
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
say on a on a sprinkler system or a fire
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
system um and that's it's unfortunate
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
but that's that's just the way it is uh
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
currently um so it would be up to um a
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
local Fire official to make sure that uh
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
the work is being done um you know in in
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
in a correct manner um but this this
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
particular law because there's only 20
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
or there's fewer than 20 folks that are
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
registered in this voluntary program it
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
really wasn't doing anything anyway the
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
only folks that were registering were
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
the folks that were on the up and up so
 
01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.950 align:start position:0%
the folks that were on the up and up so
um

01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
although so I guess it this this the
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
elimination of this program really
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything um to either help or
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
hurt the situation that that you
 
01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
describe and to to Really eliminate the
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
problem that you describe we would need
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
to make this a mandatory program and
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
then have an enforcement mechanism uh
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
tied to it so so what kind of people are
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
work uh well it depends on what kind of
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of uh fixed um protection
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
system we're talking about sprinkler
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
work is typically done by a sprinkler
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
contractor sometimes a plumber but
 
01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
typically a sprinkler contractor or a
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
mechanical outfit firearm uh work is
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
done either by electricians who who if
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
they're an electrician typically they're
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
licensed but there are um folks that
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
just do uh low voltage stuff such as uh
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
burglar alarm and fire alarm systems and
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
licensed thank you you're welcome
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative leas thank you madam
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
chair so just to get a a feel for the
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
impact or lack thereof of this uh you
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
said there's fewer than 20 that are
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
licensed do you have a general feel as
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
to how many people in the state are
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
doing this kind of work I mean is this a
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
tiny fraction the less than 20 a tiny
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
thing thank you representative for the
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
question yeah that there's there are
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of uh contractors out there
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
doing this kind of work and so this is a
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
very small fraction of those that are
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
out there doing the work thank you
 
01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.709 align:start position:0%
out there doing the work thank you
repres

01:23:41.709 --> 01:23:41.719 align:start position:0%
repres
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
um Marshall py you raised a question in
 
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
my mind uh why are you not asking
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
instead this change to become
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
mandatory thank you for the question
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative it's a it's a great
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
question and I think that someday we
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
will bring this back as a mandatory
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
program we're just not prepared to do it
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
at this time and because the
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules expired the really
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
the correct way to do this is to take
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
the law off the books for now and then
 
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
if we want to bring it back if we can if
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
we can agree as with the with all of the
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to bring it back um in a
 
01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
robust way uh then I think we will um
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
clearly the the folks that are committed
 
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
to uh fire protection and the folks that
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
are doing it the right way are going to
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
be on board with this it'll be the it'll
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
be the fly by nights that won't be so um
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
we suspect that we will bring it back at
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
some point but there they will you know
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
there's with that comes uh you know
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
certification or licensing fees and all
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff and um you know we
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
just weren't prepared to bring that
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
fellows um thank you madam chair so just
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
to follow up to represent on
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
representative shu's question
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
um if you have 20 or so people right now
 
01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
who have this voluntary
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
certification and in the next year or
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
two we were to try to put together a
 
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
program where people are certified with
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
fees I'm wondering if it might be better
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
to just let these
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
people um have their keep their not if
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's might be better to not eliminate
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
this program so that those people who do
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
have this
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
certification can be grandfathered and
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
not have to um maybe take a test again
 
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
or pay a higher
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
fee thank you representative the the the
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the fewer than 20 that
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
had the certif certification in the last
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years most of those have
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
expired anyway and then they would be
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
required to take a test to recertify
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
anyway so even under the voluntary
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
program it's not just something that
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
they automatically renew they have to
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
Marshall py and

let's
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:27.070 align:start position:0%
let's
[Music]

01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
see uh Mr poock I believe you're you're
 
01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
two correct Madam chair uh the Home
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
Builders Association has no position
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
relative to part one okay does anyone
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify on part one of
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
106 all right seeing none we'll move on
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
Carson thank you thank you again um
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
Madame chair um I will introduce the
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill which is
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
adopting changes to the State Fire and
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
Building Codes again this was a request
 
01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
of the State Fire Marshall and I just
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
like to uh state that in November of
 
01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
like to uh state that in November of
2018

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh the house bill 1254 which Madam chair
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
I believe you were a part of which was
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
the committee to study the procedures
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
for adoption of national codes by the
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire recommended a
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
standard procedure and timeline for the
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
adoption of codes the recommendation was
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire should adopt model
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
codes one cycle
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
behind um we should have adopted the
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
2018 codes in 2020 but I think um
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
because of covid that did not happen um
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
and so at this point Madam chair I'm
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
going to turn it over to uh again our
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshall to give you an
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
explanation and I thank you for your
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
time and thank the committee as well
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator so
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair for the record
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Paul pesy and I serve as the
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshall it's my privilege to
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
do so and as Senator Caron uh indicated
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 1254 uh did indicate that
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
we should try to the best that we can
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
adopt uh codes one cycle behind so this
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
would be the year that we would be
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
looking at adopting the 2018 code here
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
in 201 uh
 
01:28:39.239 --> 01:28:40.750 align:start position:0%
in 201 uh
21

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
21
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
um we did you probably remember uh we
 
01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
did a what we call a double jump in 2015
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
when we adopted uh correction in 201 18
 
01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
when we we adopted the 15 codes because
 
01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:55.639 align:start position:0%
we came from the
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
2009 and then we we skipped over the
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
2012 code and went right to the 2015
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
code and to do that double jump was a
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy lift to uh not only from
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
our side to try to put all the pieces
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
together as far as what all the changes
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
were but also from the contractor's side
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
to have to play that kind of catchup uh
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
and certainly there was uh you know
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
in making that happen but we were able
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
to do it and it was great but I think
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
what 1254 highlighted to us was we
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
really need to try to stay more current
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
with the codes and rather than fall 10
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
years behind like we did last time we
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
want to try to be you know more in the
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
in the three or so year range um so um
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
we had originally proposed this bill as
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
let's adopt the 2018 code set um and to
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
do that the border of control in the
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
building codee review board typically um
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
dissect both uh both of their codes and
 
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
they come forward with some
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations for um amendments to
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
those codes because there are some part
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
parts of the mo model code that may not
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire so uh as we've
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
seen before and we have a a whole list
 
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
of amendments to our uh model codes um
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
so this year the board of Fire Control
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
got out a little bit ahead of the
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
building code review board so the board
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
of Fire Control uh got got the fire code
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
flushed out and they were ready to go
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
for adoption this year uh the building
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
code review board primarily due to covid
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh just was unable to put it you know
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
get the final uh report done so they're
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
not quite ready uh to move forward with
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
the adoption just yet so um and and you
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
know we could you know suggest that we
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
that that we split the baby so to speak
 
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
and say adopt the fire code and we'll
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
we'll do the we'll catch up with the
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
building code later but I think that
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
really the the wise thing to do is keep
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
them together as much as we possibly can
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
and adopt the fire and building codes
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
together so uh with that we're
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
supporting uh this change to uh uh a
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
study committee for uh the building of
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
fire codes with the um with the strong
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
hope and Will that this adop gets that
 
01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
they both get adopted uh in the next
 
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
legislative season so thank you very
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to testify and
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
i' be happy to answer any questions
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question uh I was on
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
the previous uh study committee on code
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
process so is it your intention that
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
this committee would work with the
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
building code review board and the Fire
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
Control Board to develop legislation
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
for next year in 2022 to to go to the
 
01:31:51.149 --> 01:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
2018 code with the appropriate
 
01:31:51.159 --> 01:31:53.629 align:start position:0%
2018 code with the appropriate
amendments

01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Madam chair
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
yes I I think that that would exactly be
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to see happen thank you
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
very much representative Roy has a
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
Marshall crazy um if if we were to
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
separate them out um that would cause
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
problems because there are overlapping
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
fire codes that have implications on
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
regular building code is that correct
 
01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Roy that's that
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct cor we we we'll end up
 
01:32:25.109 --> 01:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
with a conflict there'll be multiple
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
conflicts we've done it before and it
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know we we got through it but it it
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
does create conflict thank you okay
 
01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.350 align:start position:0%
does create conflict thank you okay
other

01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
questions I think
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that I don't see any other
 
01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.750 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
madam

01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
madam
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
chair Mr
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
Pollock good morning again for your
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
record Maric of Gallagher Callahan and
 
01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:55.719 align:start position:0%
Garrell here is a lobbyist for the New
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Home Builders uh again I'm
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
adding my voice to the chorus of support
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
for uh for this bill uh code related I
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
agree with the procedural history
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
provided by Senator Carson and Fire
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
Marshall perzy and I also agree uh it
 
01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
didn't take us very long to ride off the
 
01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
rails of former House Bill 1254 but such
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
as life in a pandemic uh and uh there
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
are uh some uh
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between the 2018
 
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
building codes and the 2018 fire codes
 
01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
that uh in a more normal setting uh
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
would have been able to be worked out
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes but that work remains
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
in progress today uh and in fact there
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
is a joint committee on codes uh that
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
has had several meetings already uh to
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
do that work and it's my hope uh as a
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
stakeholder uh or representing a
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholder in the conversation that the
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislative committee that's uh formed
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh by this bill can preside over those
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
discussions and uh exactly as was asked
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
earlier fashion a bill for next year so
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
that those codes can move forward
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's no intent to delay
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
there's no intent to Sidetrack it's just
 
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
that work needs to be done on those
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies uh as representative Roy
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned because it's very difficult to
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
handle those inconsistencies in the
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
field when you have officials with
 
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.950 align:start position:0%
field when you have officials with
concurrent

01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
concurrent
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um happy to take any
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
questions but we are in support of part
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
two of uh Senate Bill 106 thank you
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you representative lus
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair um you mentioned um a
 
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
joint committee on codes and what what
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
is that made up of and what would that
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee's relationship be with the
 
01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.510 align:start position:0%
committee's relationship be with the
proposed

01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
one so I believe it is a statutory
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh comprised of officials from
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
the building uh officials uh and and the
 
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
fire officials uh stakeholders such as
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
the homebuilders association often
 
01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
attend those meetings and listen to the
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
content uh but I believe it is primarily
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
a forum to iron out these
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and to try and have
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
their respective uh other statutory
 
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
boards such as the building code review
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
board Andor the Fire Control Board make
 
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
amendments to the model codes so that
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
they not only conform to New Hampshire's
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
practices and specific needs uh but also
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
iron out those
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies follow up followup so
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
how would you see um you know that
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
committee interacting with the proposed
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh new one how's this all going to work
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
the new one would be comprised of
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
legislators who would be educated on the
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
issue so that a bill could come forward
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
and the uh inconsistencies be explained
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
as part of the legislative process that
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
the other joint committee uh is uh admin
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
ministrative they're they're not uh
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%

legislators thank

things uh
 
03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:46.920 align:start position:0%

03:13:48.510 --> 03:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
we currently
 
03:13:52.750 --> 03:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing U abuse of this situation
 
03:13:55.110 --> 03:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
or is this more of a hypothetical which
 
03:13:56.950 --> 03:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
nevertheless needs to be
 
03:14:00.110 --> 03:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
addressed no it's actually
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:09.550 --> 03:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
town yeah thank you pres
 
03:14:12.750 --> 03:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair um just at
 
03:14:15.229 --> 03:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
this just for some clarity and and
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
apologize ahead of time here so when it
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
talks about buying real
 
03:14:23.910 --> 03:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
estate that that would not put you in a
 
03:14:25.910 --> 03:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
situation where you
 
03:14:28.150 --> 03:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
would you would just buy real estate
 
03:14:30.590 --> 03:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
that was listed in an MLs or anything
 
03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that seems to be
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
correct follow up Madam chair
 
03:14:44.150 --> 03:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes the other the other Clarity I'm just
 
03:14:45.790 --> 03:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
looking for here is when you talk about
 
03:14:45.800 --> 03:14:47.070 align:start position:0%
looking for here is when you talk about
providing

03:14:47.070 --> 03:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
providing
 
03:14:49.830 --> 03:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
services in excess of
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
$200 and it says a political subdivision
 
03:14:55.229 --> 03:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
under which he he or she holds public
 
03:14:57.469 --> 03:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
office so as a state representative that
 
03:14:59.910 --> 03:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
would mean I couldn't offer services to
 
03:15:02.950 --> 03:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy unless I'm from I
 
03:15:05.150 --> 03:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
represent Dairy I couldn't offer um
 
03:15:07.510 --> 03:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
services to the town of dairy unless
 
03:15:08.950 --> 03:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
those were in a competitive bidding but
 
03:15:11.389 --> 03:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
I could let's say for the town of
 
03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:13.030 align:start position:0%
I could let's say for the town of
Raymond

03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
Raymond
 
03:15:14.830 --> 03:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
yes you have no control of what the town
 
03:15:18.630 --> 03:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
of Raymond does right but it means the
 
03:15:21.229 --> 03:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
selectman in Dairy would not be able to
 
03:15:25.790 --> 03:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
auditor okay how would that affect a
 
03:15:29.910 --> 03:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
county official would that that would
 
03:15:31.830 --> 03:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
apply countywide as
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.920 --> 03:15:38.910 align:start position:0%
 
sir

03:15:38.910 --> 03:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
sir
 
03:15:41.790 --> 03:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
but the C that would only affect County
 
03:15:43.790 --> 03:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
officials so we elect a county
 
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner they can't provide like I
 
03:15:50.150 --> 03:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
said the audit services to the to the
 
03:15:53.670 --> 03:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
county they can't act
 
03:15:56.189 --> 03:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
so this simply
 
03:15:58.110 --> 03:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
expands the
 
03:16:01.990 --> 03:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
current ban on selling Goods or
 
03:16:04.750 --> 03:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
Commodities to providing Services which
 
03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
are much more prevalent than they used
 
03:16:06.880 --> 03:16:09.710 align:start position:0%
are much more prevalent than they used
to

03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:11.309 align:start position:0%
 
be

03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:16:11.319 --> 03:16:13.950 align:start position:0%
be
okay

03:16:13.950 --> 03:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:16:15.389 --> 03:16:15.399 align:start position:0%

03:17:03.189 --> 03:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
might help with that is uh you know the
 
03:17:06.229 --> 03:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen could not hire one of
 
03:17:08.309 --> 03:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
the selectman to do plowing for the town
 
03:17:10.189 --> 03:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
for example as a service something like
 
03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.630 --> 03:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
questions thank you well they could
 
03:17:33.070 --> 03:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
provide the service if they were if they
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
participated in a bidd bidding process
 
03:17:41.189 --> 03:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.199 --> 03:17:43.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:17:46.630 --> 03:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um it occurs to me
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
that for example uh representative
 
03:17:52.590 --> 03:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh who is a
 
03:17:56.550 --> 03:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
firefighter if he wanted to say work
 
03:18:01.150 --> 03:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
part-time as an EMT in his town um I
 
03:18:04.429 --> 03:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
don't know for sure what Derry has but
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
in my town we just have a call fire
 
03:18:10.269 --> 03:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
department or volunteer fire department
 
03:18:12.870 --> 03:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
that gets paid by call
 
03:18:15.030 --> 03:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh would he be in violation of this if
 
03:18:18.710 --> 03:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
he did that say on a part-time basis
 
03:18:21.309 --> 03:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
that would be a contractual obligation
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
on his
 
03:18:25.950 --> 03:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
part he's Contracting with the town to
 
03:18:27.309 --> 03:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
perform that
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
service right so would that be in
 
03:18:33.790 --> 03:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
violation of this no thank
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:18:39.550 --> 03:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair um Senator
 
03:18:42.910 --> 03:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
Reagan I'm wondering if um in the when
 
03:18:45.510 --> 03:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
you heard this in the Senate if there
 
03:18:48.429 --> 03:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
was any discussion or if you have any
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions about either raising that
 
03:18:57.269 --> 03:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
$200 to a higher level or the other
 
03:19:00.389 --> 03:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
issue was it's it it sounds like if you
 
03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
were talking about snow plowing that if
 
03:19:08.070 --> 03:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
they were doing it on a Pur storm basis
 
03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
that you know it could be like $190 each
 
03:19:13.710 --> 03:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
time and they might do it 10 times in a
 
03:19:16.590 --> 03:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
winter was there any discussion of
 
03:19:20.070 --> 03:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
that no if your word of selectman is
 
03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
that devious I don't know what you do to
 
03:19:22.960 --> 03:19:25.349 align:start position:0%
that devious I don't know what you do to
stop

03:19:25.349 --> 03:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
stop
 
03:19:29.790 --> 03:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative
 
03:19:32.830 --> 03:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
sh um thank you for taking my question
 
03:19:34.469 --> 03:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
um I was just trying to find the answer
 
03:19:37.590 --> 03:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
on my own um but I have not found the
 
03:19:39.389 --> 03:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
answer so maybe you can help me I see
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
that this is in the section uh regarding
 
03:19:44.229 --> 03:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
ing the general court would this need to
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
be disclosed if someone did
 
03:19:51.070 --> 03:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
receive um a contract or sell a property
 
03:19:53.150 --> 03:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
and all the things that you've outlined
 
03:19:55.150 --> 03:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
would would it need to be a part of the
 
03:19:58.670 --> 03:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement process or in what
 
03:20:01.550 --> 03:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh way is that
 
03:20:04.110 --> 03:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
disclosed I believe there's a threshold
 
03:20:04.120 --> 03:20:05.269 align:start position:0%
disclosed I believe there's a threshold
for

03:20:05.269 --> 03:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:20:08.590 --> 03:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
that to what do you if you don't mind
 
03:20:10.189 --> 03:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
when asking what do you mean by that you
 
03:20:13.389 --> 03:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
mean the Dollar's threshold amount that
 
03:20:13.399 --> 03:20:14.269 align:start position:0%
mean the Dollar's threshold amount that
we

03:20:14.269 --> 03:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:20:18.030 --> 03:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
disclose and it would automatically be
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
in that our financial reportings anyway
 
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
is what I think you're saying it might
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
be yeah thank
 
03:20:30.910 --> 03:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
you president laus uh thank you madam
 
03:20:34.550 --> 03:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
chair um there was aate a statement that
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
um you know for the somebody was uh
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
acting as an EMT um maybe on a contract
 
03:20:43.389 --> 03:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
basis I think that would that might
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
still be included I'm not sure because
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
it says contract or otherwise except by
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
open competitive bidding I don't know
 
03:20:53.309 --> 03:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a there's a standard
 
03:20:55.710 --> 03:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
amount they're going to pay you know per
 
03:20:59.189 --> 03:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
hour let's say um whether there' be any
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
problem with um you know let's say
 
03:21:04.030 --> 03:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
represented Pearson doing that kind of
 
03:21:06.870 --> 03:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
work in Dair it's not clear to me
 
03:21:10.070 --> 03:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
not I could representative Roy has an
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
answer I think if you're talking about
 
03:21:14.960 --> 03:21:16.189 align:start position:0%
answer I think if you're talking about
the

03:21:16.189 --> 03:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
firefighting duties if you were to
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
volunteer or work par time I think by
 
03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
its nature um it's a it's a It's Kind
 
03:21:26.080 --> 03:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
its nature um it's a it's a It's Kind
like

03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
contractual and putting out to bid to
 
03:21:30.359 --> 03:21:31.710 align:start position:0%
contractual and putting out to bid to
fill

03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
fill
 
03:21:34.990 --> 03:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
positions um you see what I mean with
 
03:21:38.750 --> 03:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:41.469 --> 03:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
things um it says by contract or
 
03:21:45.150 --> 03:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise want which seems pretty
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
inclusive I mean I I support this in
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
general I'm just wondering what the
 
03:21:52.030 --> 03:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
implications might be kind
 
03:21:54.510 --> 03:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
situation thank you Senator reikan do
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
you have any wisdom for
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
us I I would it's I would think it'd be
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
people not being available to compete
 
03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.750 align:start position:0%
people not being available to compete
for

03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:13.429 --> 03:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
employment and that would be a decision
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
was representative font
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
now thank you madam chair I guess uh I
 
03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
think my question went back to the same
 
03:22:33.429 --> 03:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
as representative luckus regarding that
 
03:22:35.550 --> 03:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
that Clause that says by contract or
 
03:22:38.110 --> 03:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise then it says except by open
 
03:22:39.950 --> 03:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding and I'm wondering if
 
03:22:42.910 --> 03:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
there's an explanation or a definition
 
03:22:45.670 --> 03:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
for exactly what that means by open
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding does that mean that
 
03:22:50.830 --> 03:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
that the position or the has been
 
03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
advertised at a
 
03:22:55.950 --> 03:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
certain in a certain medium or you know
 
03:22:58.750 --> 03:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
is there some written constraints to
 
03:23:02.349 --> 03:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
that open competitive bidding Clause I
 
03:23:05.830 --> 03:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
now representative at lro do you have
 
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
some wisdom for us on that yeah I I I
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
don't have the certainty answer to that
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
but I know that uh virtually every state
 
03:23:16.269 --> 03:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
agency and
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
institution has um a definition for what
 
03:23:21.910 --> 03:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
open competitive bidding is so I think
 
03:23:26.269 --> 03:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:33.429 --> 03:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
Reagan thank you thank you for showing
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
up Senator and for humoring us with
 
03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:40.110 align:start position:0%
up Senator and for humoring us with
these

03:23:40.110 --> 03:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:23:43.229 --> 03:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
questions good to be
 
03:23:46.349 --> 03:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
here is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:23:56.750 --> 03:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
42 I don't see any hands so I'm closing
 
03:24:02.180 --> 03:24:02.190 align:start position:0%
the public
 
03:24:02.190 --> 03:24:05.870 align:start position:0%
the public
[Music]

03:24:05.870 --> 03:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:08.910 --> 03:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
hearing okay representative Roy has
 
03:24:13.229 --> 03:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
moved off to pass on Senate Bill 42
 
03:24:16.150 --> 03:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
is there a second I'll
 
03:24:19.630 --> 03:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
second representative La of sections do
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion um yeah
 
03:24:27.189 --> 03:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
just briefly um I I had introduced last
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
last term similar legislation regarding
 
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
except the off with um public employees
 
03:24:37.950 --> 03:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
accepting things from private businesses
 
03:24:39.630 --> 03:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that anytime that we have an
 
03:24:42.189 --> 03:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to prevent
 
03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
even the appearance of impropriety in
 
03:24:48.030 --> 03:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
public offices we should we should jump
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
at that I think the concern about
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
employment is is a little a little bit
 
03:24:54.830 --> 03:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
of a stretch because when you hire
 
03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
people you automatically you put it out
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
there for positions and there's laws
 
03:25:02.349 --> 03:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
that cover discrimination or or already
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
that cover nepotism things like this so
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
I feel like you know unless it's a a
 
03:25:09.550 --> 03:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
position that was created just for that
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
Public Employee and no one else could
 
03:25:14.670 --> 03:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
apply for it you wouldn't run into a
 
03:25:16.590 --> 03:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
problem with this and if that was the
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
case you would want to run into this
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
problem so I I just don't see that as a
 
03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
big impediment and like I said it's more
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
important to um to alleviate the
 
03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
appearance of impropriety in public
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
office you wish to speak to your second
 
03:25:34.510 --> 03:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
yeah just briefly uh it's uh this is an
 
03:25:38.269 --> 03:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
issue of um oh gosh you just drove it in
 
03:25:40.630 --> 03:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
my head because you said it you said
 
03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
basically what I want going to say but
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
in in the couple of rare cases where
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
there may be employment issues the the
 
03:25:48.429 --> 03:25:48.439 align:start position:0%
bottom line is just going back to the
 
03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
one concern that people seem to have was
 
03:25:53.429 --> 03:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
that all of these positions are going to
 
03:25:54.990 --> 03:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
be covered by equal employment
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity regulations and so um
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
avoiding um conflict of interest is the
 
03:26:04.710 --> 03:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
word I'm looking for even if in a couple
 
03:26:07.150 --> 03:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
of rare cases where things are on the
 
03:26:10.229 --> 03:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
borderline between contract and um
 
03:26:12.590 --> 03:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
employment um
 
03:26:14.110 --> 03:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
there's always the next town over and
 
03:26:16.349 --> 03:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
it's better to avoid the uh the conflict
 
03:26:19.229 --> 03:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
of interest issue as uh representative
 
03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
Roy said Thank you represent
 
03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
schills thank you um I find this really
 
03:26:30.429 --> 03:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
interesting and overall do like the bill
 
03:26:33.389 --> 03:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
I think it would be I would be more
 
03:26:38.710 --> 03:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
supportive of it if um we could amend it
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
to either somehow make thec disclosure
 
03:26:45.389 --> 03:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
of being a one of the categories of
 
03:26:47.389 --> 03:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
elected officials that are in the bill
 
03:26:51.269 --> 03:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
or some other measure to maybe amend our
 
03:26:56.910 --> 03:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure or possibly um file
 
03:27:01.510 --> 03:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of an Ethics form um to say
 
03:27:05.349 --> 03:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
that someone has um participated in that
 
03:27:07.469 --> 03:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
open bid process over a certain amount
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
of money maybe even $200 is um too low
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
or you know too that is too low of
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
amount for the
 
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure maybe but um I think though
 
03:27:24.189 --> 03:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
this sort of um ethics reform is is a
 
03:27:27.429 --> 03:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
great start to possibly a handful of
 
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
Ethics reforms we could potentially
 
03:27:34.229 --> 03:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
discuss and I really like uh the concept
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
and hope we can maybe find some common
 
03:27:38.630 --> 03:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
ground on more of this at some point in
 
03:27:41.950 --> 03:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
the future all right represent s
 
03:27:44.349 --> 03:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
this is just an expansion of existing
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
policy right there no yes this merely
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:54.550 --> 03:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
the representative Alro yeah again I
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
think um this will be covered under all
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
public records rules in almost every
 
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
imaginable case anyway that's a good
 
03:28:06.510 --> 03:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
point uh that uh um Representative makes
 
03:28:09.030 --> 03:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
but again just like the E eeo laws are
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
already in place I I'm guessing this
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
would all be a matter of public record
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
anyway so the disclosure is automatic I
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
may be incorrect in that but that's what
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
I would
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
expect represent uh thank you I think if
 
03:28:24.990 --> 03:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
the concern is our disclosure if I
 
03:28:27.150 --> 03:28:27.160 align:start position:0%
recall correctly we only have to
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
disclose sources of income of $10,000 or
 
03:28:32.110 --> 03:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
more and
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
so um you know if if we're getting paid
 
03:28:37.349 --> 03:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
more than that let's say you had a
 
03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
contract you know with the town to do
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
something and it was competitive B it
 
03:28:44.189 --> 03:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
was fine if you got more than $10,000
 
03:28:46.189 --> 03:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
for maybe you're you've got a Paving
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
Company and you're doing Paving for the
 
03:28:50.469 --> 03:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
town um you know if it's above that
 
03:28:52.189 --> 03:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
limit you'd have to disclose it as a
 
03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative my guess is this is uh
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
more aimed at Boards of Selectmen or
 
03:28:59.630 --> 03:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
maybe even School boards or whatever
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
with the person sits on the board
 
03:29:03.910 --> 03:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
directly making the decision on how to
 
03:29:06.670 --> 03:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
spend the money um my guess is that's a
 
03:29:09.070 --> 03:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
bigger concern as as I read it
 
03:29:12.910 --> 03:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative La it doesn't would not
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
affect us
 
03:29:17.469 --> 03:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
making uh providing services to our
 
03:29:19.150 --> 03:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
towns because we're not elected to the
 
03:29:22.429 --> 03:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
task we are elected to the state so that
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
we couldn't uh get a sweetheart
 
03:29:31.469 --> 03:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
HS representative
 
03:29:39.189 --> 03:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair um
 
03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I I support the concept of what's
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
going on here and I definitely agree
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
that this statute should in include
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
services and I'm thinking of it um from
 
03:29:57.189 --> 03:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
the perspective of of a um select
 
03:30:01.349 --> 03:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
board and when they need might want
 
03:30:04.670 --> 03:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
services and I'm so when
 
03:30:08.790 --> 03:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
you let me start again so one aspect
 
03:30:11.469 --> 03:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
about this bill before it was amended is
 
03:30:13.870 --> 03:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
it only dealt with things that would be
 
03:30:15.910 --> 03:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
individual transactions because they're
 
03:30:18.750 --> 03:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
talking about selling real estate buying
 
03:30:23.309 --> 03:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
goods buying um property in Commodities
 
03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
when you put in the services you run
 
03:30:27.910 --> 03:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
into a situation where it could be
 
03:30:30.550 --> 03:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
services that are provided
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
weekly and um then then I start to
 
03:30:39.030 --> 03:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
wonder about that 200
 
03:30:41.389 --> 03:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
$200 and if you're going to do something
 
03:30:45.269 --> 03:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
and you get $150 for it but it's weekly
 
03:30:47.950 --> 03:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
then then it's exempt but it's a lot for
 
03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
the um the the entire year so I don't
 
03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
know if that should be changed to $200
 
03:30:58.990 --> 03:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
per fiscal year the other thing that
 
03:31:00.870 --> 03:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
that just
 
03:31:05.389 --> 03:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
seems like it's an an issue is the fact
 
03:31:10.189 --> 03:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
that um the limits at which you need to
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
put things out to bid I'm assuming that
 
03:31:16.349 --> 03:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
those are not set by Statute and they're
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
probably set by the um in in towns
 
03:31:23.630 --> 03:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
they're probably set by the selectman or
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
by the city Alderman so if we put in a
 
03:31:27.720 --> 03:31:29.349 align:start position:0%
by the city Alderman so if we put in a
fixed

03:31:29.349 --> 03:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
amount I mean that can come in con
 
03:31:35.189 --> 03:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
conflict with them I mean I I I don't
 
03:31:37.389 --> 03:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
want to see somebody there nobody's
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to want to put out a bid for
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
something that cost $300 possibly so
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's a concern also and I like
 
03:31:48.590 --> 03:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
the concept I just think it's could
 
03:31:51.150 --> 03:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
cause problems and I'm disappointed that
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
Municipal Services is not here to maybe
 
03:31:56.030 --> 03:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:58.189 --> 03:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
issues repr
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
Roy um I just wanted to to well actually
 
03:32:03.990 --> 03:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'll comment on a couple things with the
 
03:32:06.269 --> 03:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
with the question about the cumulative
 
03:32:10.030 --> 03:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
effect um if if you are the person who
 
03:32:13.150 --> 03:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
plows for the town and you get $150 a
 
03:32:15.870 --> 03:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
pop I would argue that that does fall
 
03:32:18.910 --> 03:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
within that because it's it's if they
 
03:32:21.229 --> 03:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
didn't put it out the bid and it's your
 
03:32:23.790 --> 03:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
job to do it all winter long you've gone
 
03:32:25.990 --> 03:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
over that because it's you're the person
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
who plows it's if you follow what I'm
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
saying that's even if it's not a written
 
03:32:32.110 --> 03:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
contract you're the one who's expected
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
to show up and plow every stor then you
 
03:32:36.429 --> 03:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
are getting more than $200 because
 
03:32:38.550 --> 03:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
you're doing it over the whole winter I
 
03:32:40.269 --> 03:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
think you'd be hard pressed to make an
 
03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
argument that that no I'm only doing it
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
because if they don't put every storm
 
03:32:46.429 --> 03:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
out the bid and you're the one who gets
 
03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
it that you're by clearly uh the person
 
03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
who's um who's the only one to do it so
 
03:32:56.429 --> 03:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think that's that answers
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
 thank you madam chair and I too had
 
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
the same concerns uh as representative
 
03:33:10.349 --> 03:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
fellows because of the wording at any
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
one sale to or from um and that concerns
 
03:33:16.269 --> 03:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
me because it could be anyone who does
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh multiple service contracts um with
 
03:33:21.389 --> 03:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
the city or town could be someone who
 
03:33:24.510 --> 03:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
owns for instance a um who's a mechanic
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
and repairs Vehicles as a see fit or
 
03:33:29.309 --> 03:33:29.319 align:start position:0%
need to come in
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
um and my question would be to this
 
03:33:35.429 --> 03:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
whole statute and I'm not sure when it
 
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
was implemented but is $200 too low of a
 
03:33:41.309 --> 03:33:41.319 align:start position:0%
threshold should it be bumped up
 
03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
um do these cities and towns need to put
 
03:33:47.070 --> 03:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
a competitive bid out for every thing
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
that goes over $200 or should to be more
 
03:33:52.269 --> 03:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
of a an upper threshold um so those are
 
03:33:53.950 --> 03:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
my concerns um I'm not sure whether we
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
need to look into this a little further
 
03:33:57.870 --> 03:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
than passing it right today it's not uh
 
03:34:00.150 --> 03:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
something that's do well right
 
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
away um so I would like to see it
 
03:34:05.150 --> 03:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
researched this statute was originally
 
03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
03:34:10.870 --> 03:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
1941 it was amended in 69 and then in
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
1975 to raise it from $25 to
 
03:34:15.920 --> 03:34:17.429 align:start position:0%
1975 to raise it from $25 to
$200

03:34:17.429 --> 03:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
$200
 
03:34:17.439 --> 03:34:19.189 align:start position:0%
$200
so

03:34:19.189 --> 03:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:22.630 --> 03:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
um it also deleted members of an
 
03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
exception for members of the general
 
03:34:29.429 --> 03:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
court in that was5 so I yes this is a
 
03:34:32.590 --> 03:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
very old statute and it's not actually
 
03:34:35.309 --> 03:34:35.319 align:start position:0%
been amended very many times or
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
something that old so we're looking the
 
03:34:39.630 --> 03:34:39.640 align:start position:0%
last time the dollar averages moved up
 
03:34:43.150 --> 03:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
was 197 9 74
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
75 so that's dollar value in 75 versus
 
03:34:48.429 --> 03:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
today that's my question I think this is
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
a low threshold that it could be moved
 
03:34:50.880 --> 03:34:52.349 align:start position:0%
a low threshold that it could be moved
thank

03:34:52.349 --> 03:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:34:55.389 --> 03:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
you all right representative
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair well
 
03:34:59.229 --> 03:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative goalie is already
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
exploring the uh area that I'm
 
03:35:05.469 --> 03:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
interested in uh so what is our deadline
 
03:35:07.910 --> 03:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
here because I think just one or two
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
questions to uh to people who are even
 
03:35:13.750 --> 03:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable than we are have
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
already been hearing from our own
 
03:35:18.429 --> 03:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
committee members uh might be helpful if
 
03:35:21.150 --> 03:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple weeks to kick this
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
around and make sure that we get the
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
dollar amount right and because
 
03:35:29.950 --> 03:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise I think that adding services
 
03:35:32.670 --> 03:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
in is just common
 
03:35:35.469 --> 03:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
sense we may be overthinking it a bit
 
03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
but uh we do not have any deadline that
 
03:35:41.710 --> 03:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
I any near-term deadline on this bill
 
03:35:43.389 --> 03:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
it's a Senate
 
03:35:46.910 --> 03:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill it's probably sometime in
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
May I mean you know a lot of these
 
03:35:51.870 --> 03:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
people in these little towns they donate
 
03:35:55.389 --> 03:35:55.399 align:start position:0%
their services to the town they do X Y
 
03:35:59.189 --> 03:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
and Z they don't even charge
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
because part part goes with the
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
territory but uh but to the degree that
 
03:36:06.150 --> 03:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
somebody's doing something on a regular
 
03:36:10.189 --> 03:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
basis uh providing a service I think
 
03:36:12.670 --> 03:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's a appropriate to amend the statute
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
but we I think we have a couple of
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
questions we could we could F out to uh
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
people who do this on a daily
 
03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
basis representative
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair I will just
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
add my voice uh to say that I I don't
 
03:36:32.469 --> 03:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
see the um need to rush to judgment on
 
03:36:34.670 --> 03:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
this I think we need to look into it a
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:39.479 --> 03:36:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
more

03:36:41.590 --> 03:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:36:45.670 --> 03:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay represent leus uh thank you m I'm
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay either is it the way it is or or
 
03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
fixing some of the the things people
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
think are problems but just uh for
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
information $200 in 1975 today is
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
approximately $1,000 it's about five
 
03:37:00.510 --> 03:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
times since that it's a fairly low
 
03:37:00.520 --> 03:37:02.630 align:start position:0%
times since that it's a fairly low
threshold

03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
03:37:06.990 --> 03:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so somebody wanted to amend it up a
 
03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:09.389 align:start position:0%
yeah so somebody wanted to amend it up a
th

03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
th
 
03:37:13.389 --> 03:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
equivalent representative Roy um I'm
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
happy to withdraw my motion if we want
 
03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
to amend the money thing my only my only
 
03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
concern is the object of the bill is to
 
03:37:23.550 --> 03:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
actually net as many people as we can
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
that are public officials that are
 
03:37:28.030 --> 03:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
profiting from public money so by
 
03:37:30.990 --> 03:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
raising the bar we're gonna we're gonna
 
03:37:34.110 --> 03:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
we're g to affect less people that are
 
03:37:36.830 --> 03:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
getting money from the public cers not
 
03:37:39.309 --> 03:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
more and the object of the bill I think
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that anyone who's
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
profiting or may appear to be profiting
 
03:37:47.229 --> 03:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
by their position in public government
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
is um is is disclosed there's no law in
 
03:37:53.229 --> 03:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that requires uh
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding based on any kind of
 
03:37:59.030 --> 03:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
amount unless it's a public official so
 
03:38:00.670 --> 03:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
raising that up to
 
03:38:03.429 --> 03:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
$1,000 is and especially as it that we'd
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
have to amend the per occurrence thing
 
03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
too I think because now you know that's
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
a significant amount amount of money
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
over extended period of
 
03:38:14.510 --> 03:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
time I don't know I just feel like
 
03:38:16.710 --> 03:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
leaving it a low threshold accomplishes
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill better than
 
03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
giving them more
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
wi but that's just my opinion I'm happy
 
03:38:22.399 --> 03:38:24.990 align:start position:0%
wi but that's just my opinion I'm happy
to

03:38:24.990 --> 03:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:27.429 --> 03:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
Def and then representative go
 
03:38:28.990 --> 03:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative made the point
 
03:38:31.950 --> 03:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
they'll be going to did a $300 contract
 
03:38:36.189 --> 03:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
or or anything and I I like the idea uh
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative sh said we need to do
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
some research I think this is really a
 
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
feel for it I don't know that research
 
03:38:46.429 --> 03:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
,000 per year uh captures representative
 
03:38:53.670 --> 03:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
fellows concerned and if that's the
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be F speaking for
 
03:38:59.950 --> 03:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
me that'd be fine to have ,000 over the
 
03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
year that's
 
03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
that okay representative
 
03:39:07.870 --> 03:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
Brian uh thank you madam chair I would
 
03:39:10.630 --> 03:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh agree with uh both uh representative
 
03:39:13.950 --> 03:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
goalie and Lakers I too went to Google
 
03:39:16.990 --> 03:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
and the uh inflation calculator and then
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
come did come up with the $1,000 and if
 
03:39:22.349 --> 03:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
we look back when this bill was
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
originally introduced uh the intention
 
03:39:28.590 --> 03:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
was the value of $200 so basically in
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
the maintenance because of inflation as
 
03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
time goes on everything's much more uh
 
03:39:37.630 --> 03:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
expensive the Thousand does make sense
 
03:39:40.830 --> 03:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
to me and keeps in line with what the
 
03:39:43.189 --> 03:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
original bill was intended to do in the
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
beginning so it's just basically a
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
maintenance issue maybe there's other
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
bills that should be taken a look at
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
very similarly so thank you
 
03:39:54.750 --> 03:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm just I would like to have
 
03:39:57.920 --> 03:39:59.070 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm just I would like to have
some

03:39:59.070 --> 03:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:40:03.309 --> 03:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
research on what um municipalities
 
03:40:05.950 --> 03:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
currently do related to this maybe they
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
have some of their own policies in place
 
03:40:12.070 --> 03:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
that that have some kind of cap on this
 
03:40:16.150 --> 03:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
and so I know I can ask my um Town
 
03:40:19.950 --> 03:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
manager what they do with this situation
 
03:40:22.269 --> 03:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe they just need to disclose
 
03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
it maybe they just need to adopt a
 
03:40:27.830 --> 03:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
policy on this just just throwing things
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
out I don't know exactly what's going on
 
03:40:32.510 --> 03:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
so I can't propose a
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
fix Bailey thank you mad
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
chair to me the problem is like a
 
03:40:40.349 --> 03:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
category one that Services is is
 
03:40:42.670 --> 03:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
completely not in the same category with
 
03:40:45.510 --> 03:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
everything else and so to fix the
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
services you'd have to put in per
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
year but you wouldn't be selling real
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
estate the same piece of real estate
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
ever again or the same personal property
 
03:40:58.990 --> 03:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
ever again it it doesn't Services
 
03:41:01.189 --> 03:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong with the other things in
 
03:41:01.199 --> 03:41:02.790 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong with the other things in
this

03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:41:05.150 --> 03:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
bill interesting thank you represent
 
03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
laus yeah um actually I I uh think
 
03:41:11.110 --> 03:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
that's not quite true has Commodities I
 
03:41:13.070 --> 03:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
mean you could have own a qu in town and
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
you could be selling sand for sanding
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
and that would be an ongoing thing
 
03:41:18.560 --> 03:41:21.950 align:start position:0%
and that would be an ongoing thing
that

03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:24.189 --> 03:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
goie thank you m chair and I just want
 
03:41:28.349 --> 03:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
to go back to my original example of say
 
03:41:29.710 --> 03:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
if someone who's on the board of
 
03:41:32.469 --> 03:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
selectman um owns a garage and does auto
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
repairs for maybe the uh Town Cruiser or
 
03:41:41.469 --> 03:41:41.479 align:start position:0%
some of the vehicles uh in the town um
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
my question is it says provide services
 
03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
if he's got to go out and buy a part
 
03:41:45.920 --> 03:41:47.550 align:start position:0%
if he's got to go out and buy a part
that's

03:41:47.550 --> 03:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:41:49.870 --> 03:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
$200 and he doesn't know the cost until
 
03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
he gets it um looked up and then he
 
03:41:55.510 --> 03:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
still has to provide what it's going to
 
03:41:57.269 --> 03:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
cost for him to do the work on top of
 
03:41:59.429 --> 03:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
that I would assume that the cost of the
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
part plus what he's providing for a
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
service is a service
 
03:42:06.590 --> 03:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
fee um so with that being said every
 
03:42:09.550 --> 03:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
time a vehicle is being repaired uh does
 
03:42:12.070 --> 03:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
it have to be put on hold and send out
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
to competitive bid before any uh piece
 
03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
of equipment can be repaired um and
 
03:42:20.030 --> 03:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's my concern with this low
 
03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
threshold whereas $1 thousand do I think
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
would be more reasonable thank
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
you yeah I I could be mistaken thank you
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
for recognizing me but I think we're
 
03:42:32.149 --> 03:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
losing focus on what the purpose of this
 
03:42:35.229 --> 03:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
bill is for and that's to avoid conflict
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
of interest so whether it's $200 or
 
03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:40.469 align:start position:0%
of interest so whether it's $200 or
$20,000

03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
$20,000
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
the town selectman shouldn't be
 
03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
repairing the town's police cars it's
 
03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
just a conflict of interest so I think
 
03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
the $200 is almost just a nominal
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
throwout there it as far as I'm
 
03:42:53.469 --> 03:42:53.479 align:start position:0%
concerned it could just as well be zero
 
03:42:53.479 --> 03:42:59.469 align:start position:0%
concerned it could just as well be zero
thank

03:42:59.469 --> 03:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.670 --> 03:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
you I understand what representative
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
goalie is saying and I also understand
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
what representative Alro is saying and I
 
03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
think that
 
03:43:12.790 --> 03:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
in many situations in many towns that
 
03:43:14.990 --> 03:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
are large enough there's going to be
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
ample people to
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
do work right it doesn't have to be the
 
03:43:22.030 --> 03:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
border of Select when that does the
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
stuff but in smaller towns it may be
 
03:43:28.830 --> 03:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
that way so I think I just I agree that
 
03:43:30.550 --> 03:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
we should I agree with representative
 
03:43:33.229 --> 03:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
fellows that we should just scope it out
 
03:43:35.229 --> 03:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
on the smaller town levels to make sure
 
03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479 align:start position:0%
that we're just not impinging on their
 
03:43:42.070 --> 03:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.080 --> 03:43:43.070 align:start position:0%
 
that's

03:43:43.070 --> 03:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:43:48.510 --> 03:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
all okay algra thank you again uh I come
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
from a pretty small town Campton and
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
thoron is less than five minutes away if
 
03:43:54.070 --> 03:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
we can't get the cruiser fixed in
 
03:43:56.349 --> 03:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
Campton it's really not a problem to go
 
03:43:57.790 --> 03:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
over to fil where the work belongs
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
anyway in my opinion thank you yeah and
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
I I know that in my town we have a town
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
report every year that lists the major
 
03:44:11.349 --> 03:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
contracts and and the smaller contracts
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
and who got paid what for services so
 
03:44:16.229 --> 03:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
you could see that the
 
03:44:19.590 --> 03:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh Road agent made so much and
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
the fire chief got paid so much for
 
03:44:24.910 --> 03:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
regular for his regular stuff and so
 
03:44:27.990 --> 03:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
much for details so that information is
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
published but but if you've got the
 
03:44:33.870 --> 03:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
Selectmen out
 
03:44:36.349 --> 03:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
there with essentially a contract to
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
maintain the police cruiser that is a
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
cont seems like a conflict of
 
03:44:44.429 --> 03:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
interest I mean if you're talking about
 
03:44:47.469 --> 03:44:47.479 align:start position:0%
a contract to do all the maintenance you
 
03:44:49.229 --> 03:44:49.239 align:start position:0%
know and in charge individually that
 
03:44:52.590 --> 03:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
to um I would also add that with
 
03:44:59.189 --> 03:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative Go's example I'm unaware
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
of any town that that handles their
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
repairs for their vehicles on a on a at
 
03:45:08.229 --> 03:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
per vehicle basis generally they have an
 
03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
agreement or a contract with one
 
03:45:13.469 --> 03:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
mechanic or service provider um that
 
03:45:16.349 --> 03:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
handles all of their repairs I I I
 
03:45:19.149 --> 03:45:19.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I couldn't Envision whether the
 
03:45:20.750 --> 03:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
cruise is broke let's see who we can get
 
03:45:22.510 --> 03:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
to repair it they generally have someone
 
03:45:24.349 --> 03:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
that they send their their work to so I
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
okayy thank you madam chair it well it
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
is an example and a hypothetical example
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
it could very well happen and to
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative gr uh
 
03:45:44.910 --> 03:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
scenario that going from Campton to
 
03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
Thornton to get something repaired could
 
03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
end up costing your your town more money
 
03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
to have to go out of the Town versus
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of it in town so that's not
 
03:45:56.189 --> 03:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
as good an example either um if it's a
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
competitive bid and it's a lower
 
03:45:59.149 --> 03:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
contract I would think you would want to
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
keep it in your town thank
 
03:46:06.550 --> 03:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
you that fellows thank you madam chair I
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
I can tell you little towns they like to
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
support the local businesses if they can
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
do that um the other thing that comes to
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
mind is what if the let's let's deal
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
with the auto repair issue so what if
 
03:46:27.149 --> 03:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
the if it's a business that's an LLC or
 
03:46:27.159 --> 03:46:27.910 align:start position:0%
the if it's a business that's an LLC or
it's

03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:46:30.750 --> 03:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
Incorporated and it's owned or partly
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
owned by a person who's on the select
 
03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
board so is that the same as paying on
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
on the books you wouldn't know you
 
03:46:42.189 --> 03:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know what was going on um is
 
03:46:44.309 --> 03:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
that okay if you're paying a business
 
03:46:49.710 --> 03:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:52.110 --> 03:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
select there just just seems like a lot
 
03:46:52.120 --> 03:46:54.830 align:start position:0%
select there just just seems like a lot
of

03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
issues get deep into the weeds represent
 
03:47:00.830 --> 03:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
leus thank you um as I said before I'd
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
be okay passing this the way it is you
 
03:47:04.830 --> 03:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
know or if somebody wants to amend it
 
03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
but uh you know I would I would think
 
03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
that if there is a violation somebody's
 
03:47:11.950 --> 03:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
going to have to you know how would it
 
03:47:13.630 --> 03:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
be enforced I assume somebody would have
 
03:47:14.790 --> 03:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
to bring it
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
up um and although I don't generally
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
like leaving things to the court some of
 
03:47:22.469 --> 03:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
these fine details I don't think we can
 
03:47:24.710 --> 03:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
think of all of them and that's the sort
 
03:47:26.189 --> 03:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
of thing that the courts would end up
 
03:47:28.269 --> 03:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with if there was a case
 
03:47:30.630 --> 03:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
brought we can't solve everything here I
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
don't think I I kind of think we're the
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
wrong group to deal with this this
 
03:47:37.469 --> 03:47:37.479 align:start position:0%
should be in Municipal and County rather
 
03:47:40.349 --> 03:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
than on this committee because
 
03:47:42.030 --> 03:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
this sounds like the sort of things that
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
we just County deals with so we're we're
 
03:47:48.149 --> 03:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
kind of out of our depth uh
 
03:47:50.429 --> 03:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
representative Roy if you will withdraw
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
your motion I think that would be the
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
best action to
 
03:47:58.469 --> 03:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.630 --> 03:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh sure I'll be happy to withraw okay
 
03:48:04.590 --> 03:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
you transfer to County if you can uh
 
03:48:06.910 --> 03:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'll try but I we held a hearing so we
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
may not be able to we can certain
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
go consult yeah and we should all talk
 
03:48:15.550 --> 03:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
to our towns and
 
03:48:18.309 --> 03:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
say because it's laws been on the book
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
for 80 years all right we should be your
 
03:48:24.670 --> 03:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
town should have a know how they deal
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
with it and hi lisis Mike O'Brian how
 
03:48:28.080 --> 03:48:28.750 align:start position:0%
with it and hi lisis Mike O'Brian how
are

03:48:28.750 --> 03:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
you yes Mike if you would if
 
03:48:36.910 --> 03:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
you yeah I booked a m for tomorrow so I
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
had to take that call all right glad
 
03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
what's that I'm
 
03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
sorry I said we're glad to hear you're
 
03:48:50.110 --> 03:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
okay but I yeah we we we should each do
 
03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
some research on what we can how this is
 
03:48:55.389 --> 03:48:55.399 align:start position:0%
handled now because these issues should
 
03:48:57.389 --> 03:48:57.399 align:start position:0%
not be
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
new and it's only the question of
 
03:49:01.790 --> 03:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know whether you're
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
delivering a case of uh milk to the town
 
03:49:09.389 --> 03:49:09.399 align:start position:0%
offices every week or or whatever for
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
fing the
 
03:49:14.070 --> 03:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
books anything we do will be an
 
03:49:16.110 --> 03:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
improvement it may not be the best
 
03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement but if we don't do anything
 
03:49:21.389 --> 03:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
it's worse than than not making a small
 
03:49:24.670 --> 03:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
Improvement so let's let's pull some of
 
03:49:28.030 --> 03:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
the weeds out here but we do have a
 
03:49:30.750 --> 03:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
month or so okay to do some research
 
03:49:32.670 --> 03:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
before we decide that we'll just take
 
03:49:34.229 --> 03:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
fine all right so everybody research the
 
03:49:41.229 --> 03:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
your issues and we'll see what happens
 
03:49:42.830 --> 03:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
fellow I would just like to say that if
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
if you're going to talk to your town
 
03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
managers one of the things might to ask
 
03:49:52.349 --> 03:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
be to ask them if they have a policy
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
about this not just the issue of the uh
 
03:49:57.149 --> 03:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
dollar limit because they may be
 
03:49:59.950 --> 03:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
handling it some other way in terms of
 
03:49:59.960 --> 03:50:01.990 align:start position:0%
handling it some other way in terms of
disclosure

03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
03:50:04.510 --> 03:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they should be handling it some
 
03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
way we don't know exactly how all right
 
03:50:11.149 --> 03:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
well that was
 
03:50:15.910 --> 03:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:18.349 --> 03:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
that and we hardly looked at the issue
 
03:50:18.359 --> 03:50:20.990 align:start position:0%
that and we hardly looked at the issue
at

03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:25.309 --> 03:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
all no I wouldn't say that I'm I'm I'm
 
03:50:28.189 --> 03:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
joking I'm joking it would make a great
 
03:50:30.149 --> 03:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
topic for what I did with my
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
summer EXC Madam chairman would you like
 
03:50:35.910 --> 03:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
me to contact the municipal Association
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
and see if they have some insight on the
 
03:50:40.950 --> 03:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
these questions yes please that would be
 
03:50:43.870 --> 03:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
delightful okay great and anything else
 
03:50:46.670 --> 03:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
let me know what I can do I think they
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
they should have general information on
 
03:50:53.189 --> 03:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
how this is covered right right now and
 
03:50:56.429 --> 03:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
they may know if there's issues with it
 
03:50:59.550 --> 03:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
okay but we talk to our town managers
 
03:51:02.670 --> 03:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
for select them absolutely something
 
03:51:04.830 --> 03:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
something we should we do
 
03:51:04.840 --> 03:51:08.149 align:start position:0%
something we should we do
anyway

03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay we have a few minutes until 2:00
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
when we're hearing our Second non-
 
03:51:20.149 --> 03:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
141 did you wish to make a motion
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.349 --> 03:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
you I I couldn't hear what that was he
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't made the motion yet he's agreeing
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
that he will
 
03:51:38.159 --> 03:51:44.710 align:start position:0%
that he will
make

03:51:44.710 --> 03:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually planning on doing motion
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
this okay sorry if you're not letting on
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
want actually sorry
 
03:52:00.510 --> 03:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking about the other Bill
 
03:52:03.510 --> 03:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
the other build I if it's okay I'll make
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
it not to pass motion on HD 106 orb 106
 
03:52:11.670 --> 03:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:14.269 --> 03:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
so on Senate Bill 106 representative
 
03:52:19.469 --> 03:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:22.030 --> 03:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
pass like to speak to your
 
03:52:24.389 --> 03:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
motion yes I mean there's two parts to
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
this um repealing the voluntary fire
 
03:52:30.189 --> 03:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
service equipment certification seems
 
03:52:32.469 --> 03:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
like something we should do since it's
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishing basically nothing um
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
there's only a tiny fraction of the
 
03:52:39.349 --> 03:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
people uh installing the equipment who
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
get it and so it's providing no benefit
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
at this
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
time and
 
03:52:50.429 --> 03:52:50.439 align:start position:0%
um part two as I understand it there are
 
03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
boards that that review the um fire code
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
of the building code but having a a
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee of legislators
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
involved and presumably following that
 
03:53:07.229 --> 03:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
uh process and then you know creating
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
and or reviewing any legisl should
 
03:53:11.710 --> 03:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
Implement I think is a good idea because
 
03:53:13.750 --> 03:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a simple
 
03:53:13.760 --> 03:53:16.229 align:start position:0%
it's not a simple
topic

03:53:16.229 --> 03:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
topic
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to add on regard that
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee the last time we updated the
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
building codes it came through
 
03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:25.429 align:start position:0%
building codes it came through
Edna

03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
Edna
 
03:53:29.469 --> 03:53:29.479 align:start position:0%
and even with the support of the
 
03:53:31.550 --> 03:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
building code review board and the fire
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
marshal and some members of the
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee who were very knowledgeable
 
03:53:38.469 --> 03:53:38.479 align:start position:0%
about codes it took us a great deal of
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
effort to resolve some of the the
 
03:53:46.189 --> 03:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
conflicts that uh the political
 
03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
conflicts in the building code less so
 
03:53:51.550 --> 03:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
in the fire code fortunately and then
 
03:53:53.229 --> 03:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
the conflicts between the fire code and
 
03:53:56.429 --> 03:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
the building code and having a
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
smaller probably somewhat more
 
03:54:01.349 --> 03:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable group would be very would
 
03:54:04.910 --> 03:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
be helpful and regarding the inv
 
03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
voluntary fire service equipment if
 
03:54:10.149 --> 03:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
essentially the Fire Marshall is saying
 
03:54:12.269 --> 03:54:12.279 align:start position:0%
the program at this point is not worth
 
03:54:14.110 --> 03:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
going through rule writing and their
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
current rules have expired they don't
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
want it it's just not worth the effort
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
and the the stakeholders do not seem to
 
03:54:26.429 --> 03:54:26.439 align:start position:0%
care about the
 
03:54:29.830 --> 03:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
process so nobody wants it let's let's
 
03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
get rid of it if we need to deal with it
 
03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
later we
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
will representative
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um at the risk
 
03:54:42.269 --> 03:54:42.279 align:start position:0%
of sounding like someone who has her
 
03:54:44.429 --> 03:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
feet mired in
 
03:54:47.429 --> 03:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
mud um I was hoping that we could wait
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
on this a little bit uh I had attempted
 
03:54:54.030 --> 03:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
to reach out over the weekend to the
 
03:54:57.149 --> 03:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
fire chief in my town and have been able
 
03:55:00.429 --> 03:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
unable to make contact with him uh
 
03:55:04.149 --> 03:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
particularly concern as to the voluntary
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
fire service equipment I just wanted to
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with him and have
 
03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
been unable to do that as yet so was
 
03:55:15.269 --> 03:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
hoping I could put off making a decision
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
on that part of this bill I'm certainly
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
in favor of the other
 
03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
section repr
 
03:55:29.349 --> 03:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
BR thank you madam chair I so if we um
 
03:55:31.630 --> 03:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking of the of the timeing
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with the bill but I'm trying to
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the committee BAS basically would be
 
03:55:43.510 --> 03:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
in would be in charge of monit of
 
03:55:46.870 --> 03:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
assessing what would need to get done in
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
adopting the F the state fire codes and
 
03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
the state building
 
03:55:54.030 --> 03:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
codes because of potential points of
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
conflict between the two
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay also go ahead I'm sorry
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
so amendments that are political in
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
nature to some degree okay
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
now they
 
03:56:12.830 --> 03:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
would so they would have until
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
November of this year to
 
03:56:18.750 --> 03:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate to put this together for the
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
correct and then we would put into
 
03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
legislation adopting the 2018 fire codes
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
year correct yes so
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
then we would do this subsequently with
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
every adoption of the upcoming fire code
 
03:56:49.389 --> 03:56:49.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
correct uh we would do something either
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
this separate committee or we could have
 
03:57:01.070 --> 03:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
had a bill in this year that to to study
 
03:57:05.149 --> 03:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
it but between uh see yeah we should
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
have done that this
 
03:57:10.110 --> 03:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
year some things have gotten slower
 
03:57:14.990 --> 03:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
because of Co but the so the 2021 code
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
24 correct and so this is what I'm
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
thinking is it
 
03:57:24.349 --> 03:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
possible not that I want to make this
 
03:57:27.469 --> 03:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
longer but is it possible to as as this
 
03:57:30.149 --> 03:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
bill stands is this commission or this
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
committee is it a
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
once yes okay is it possible
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
that we would make this or do you
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
recommend that we do this just every
 
03:57:45.670 --> 03:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
time we have to redo the fire codes
 
03:57:47.910 --> 03:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're just going to initiate this
 
03:57:50.910 --> 03:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee or do we want to make this
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
something that's going to happen the
 
03:57:57.389 --> 03:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
codes I think something that we can ask
 
03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee just to conclude in
 
03:58:04.149 --> 03:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
its report how do they deal with the
 
03:58:08.269 --> 03:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
next update okay let's do that let's do
 
03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
that because I think it's you know
 
03:58:12.269 --> 03:58:12.279 align:start position:0%
rather because it's not that one of us
 
03:58:16.469 --> 03:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
might forget or you know just how that
 
03:58:19.830 --> 03:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
goes represent fellows thank you madam
 
03:58:23.550 --> 03:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
chair I just wanted to ask you about the
 
03:58:26.189 --> 03:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
fact that this committee that's proposed
 
03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
has three senators and three House
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives and and I rarely see
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
that on committies usually it's only one
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
Senator just can you tell me if that's
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
unusual or makes sense to
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
you the it means the Senate is taking it
 
03:58:47.830 --> 03:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
seriously and it probably means they've
 
03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
got three volunteers lined
 
03:58:53.950 --> 03:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
up I mean
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's they
 
03:58:58.469 --> 03:58:58.479 align:start position:0%
don't three Senators if they don't have
 
03:59:01.630 --> 03:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
three Senators ready to do the
 
03:59:01.640 --> 03:59:03.070 align:start position:0%
three Senators ready to do the
work

03:59:03.070 --> 03:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:59:03.080 --> 03:59:07.149 align:start position:0%
work
[Music]

03:59:07.149 --> 03:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
followup black
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um am I correcting
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding that whatever this um
 
03:59:16.750 --> 03:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee comes up with as as far as
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
proposal would still go through the
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
normal process and come to Edna
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
and and all that oh yes they'll just
 
03:59:26.309 --> 03:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
have their report will say you know
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
these are our recommendations and
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
three4 any other questions or
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:45.950 align:start position:0%
three4 any other questions or
comments

03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:45.960 --> 03:59:47.349 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:49.870 --> 03:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
motion I guess I do want to ask this
 
03:59:53.429 --> 03:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
question uh how as a matter of courtesy
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
how strongly does representative sh feel
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
about this because it' be nice to clear
 
04:00:01.110 --> 04:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
the text but it's if she's really hot
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
about it I would be in favor of special
 
04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
ordering in
 
04:00:07.359 --> 04:00:09.030 align:start position:0%
ordering in
effect

04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:00:11.389 --> 04:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
so that's really my question to her do
 
04:00:13.110 --> 04:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
you mind if
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
we well second I just that was not a com
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay I apologize it's a question
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
sh yes um well I I don't know because as
 
04:00:29.189 --> 04:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
I said I've been unable to make contact
 
04:00:32.830 --> 04:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
with my chief uh in my town for these
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
last uh four days I've been trying um
 
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if if he feels that
 
04:00:43.710 --> 04:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's no problem then I would say it's no
 
04:00:46.710 --> 04:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
problem but if I talk to him this
 
04:00:49.469 --> 04:00:49.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon or tomorrow and we've already
 
04:00:52.349 --> 04:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
made this ought to pass and he says oh
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
no this is a big problem in our town
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to be
 
04:00:58.990 --> 04:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
conflicted so I don't know how to answer
 
04:01:01.910 --> 04:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
your question exactly but like I said I
 
04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
I just was hoping uh where we didn't act
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
on it this morning right after the
 
04:01:10.349 --> 04:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
hearing uh that I could have a chance to
 
04:01:15.060 --> 04:01:15.070 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:15.070 --> 04:01:17.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:01:17.710 --> 04:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:01:23.070 --> 04:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
way black yeah my only question is um if
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
we did delay and I was not objecting to
 
04:01:31.110 --> 04:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
that but if we did
 
04:01:31.120 --> 04:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
that but if we did
delay

04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
delay
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what the process is
 
04:01:36.590 --> 04:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
going to be and when this would actually
 
04:01:38.790 --> 04:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
go into effect my only concern concern
 
04:01:41.830 --> 04:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's not an issue is that this
 
04:01:44.149 --> 04:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
committee if we if we form it has enough
 
04:01:46.229 --> 04:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
time to to do what's likely to be a
 
04:01:46.239 --> 04:01:47.630 align:start position:0%
time to to do what's likely to be a
complicated

04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
J I don't know how much delay
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
to uh well we're going to miss at least
 
04:01:53.439 --> 04:01:54.550 align:start position:0%
to uh well we're going to miss at least
two

04:01:54.550 --> 04:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
weeks probably at Le Pro more likely
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
three or
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
four but yes it is going to be a
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
complicated job and
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh I am I am taking notes on who
 
04:02:09.030 --> 04:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
expressed interest serving on that
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
committee because I'm afraid I'm not
 
04:02:23.790 --> 04:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.590 --> 04:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
question all right in that case the
 
04:02:32.269 --> 04:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass by
 
04:02:32.279 --> 04:02:34.710 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass by

04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
days all right I I think
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to hold on to this so
 
04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
that people could I don't think we
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
should put this out with a fight when
 
04:04:50.830 --> 04:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
we're when we're in general agreement on
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
the bill we merely have a few minor
 
04:04:55.469 --> 04:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
questions that a couple of people want
 
04:04:58.349 --> 04:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
to talk about so I will hold on to it
 
04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
and we can reconsider that motion at our
 
04:05:03.389 --> 04:05:03.399 align:start position:0%
next executive session or we could just
 
04:05:05.469 --> 04:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
let it go but I'm I'm not going to to
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
send it Forward right now I appreciate
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
that very much Madam fa thank
 
04:05:12.439 --> 04:05:14.630 align:start position:0%
that very much Madam fa thank
you

04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
question that my motion would it be
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate to retain that bill could we
 
04:05:26.830 --> 04:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm having a hard time hearing the
 
04:05:33.189 --> 04:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
conversation um that was on on which
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
bills 42 yeah we don't have to vote to
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
retain it yet we do have I think a month
 
04:05:43.389 --> 04:05:43.399 align:start position:0%
before we have to vote it out so we all
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
go talk to our select if there's any and
 
04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
our researcher is going to check with
 
04:05:51.630 --> 04:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association and if we
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
still have questions next time we bring
 
04:05:58.030 --> 04:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
it up then yes we can retain it then but
 
04:06:00.429 --> 04:06:00.439 align:start position:0%
I think we can find out a lot in a
 
04:06:02.670 --> 04:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
couple weeks representative Schulz do
 
04:06:05.070 --> 04:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
you have a question I do about something
 
04:06:08.590 --> 04:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
totally different um I
 
04:06:10.149 --> 04:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me if it if it's totally
 
04:06:11.790 --> 04:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
different can we go to the public
 
04:06:16.110 --> 04:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
right it's being after 2
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%

members of Edna committee as discussed
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
before when we looked at this issue uh
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
there was a great amount of discussion
 
04:06:49.560 --> 04:06:51.309 align:start position:0%
there was a great amount of discussion
regarding

04:06:51.309 --> 04:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
a uh municipality or County's ability to
 
04:06:57.429 --> 04:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
miraculously erase their pension
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
debt so in uh in an incredible amount of
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
very quick work um in attempt to get
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
this ready for Monday I contacted the
 
04:07:07.319 --> 04:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
this ready for Monday I contacted the
retire

04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
retire
 
04:07:10.349 --> 04:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
system as well as some other
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to get their their gist of
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
of how that should look one of the
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
things that I've learned being on this
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
committee is it is always best to make
 
04:07:22.990 --> 04:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
sure the retirement system is happy with
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
the language you're about to bring
 
04:07:26.189 --> 04:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
forward because ultimately they're the
 
04:07:27.870 --> 04:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
ones that are going to have to interpret
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
it so in consultation with the New
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and in uh
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
discussions with with Marty Carin with
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
and subsequently you know members of of
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
that office they came up with um some
 
04:07:43.389 --> 04:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
language that was attached to the bottom
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
of hinal non-gain amendment that
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
basically just says if you are going to
 
04:07:49.319 --> 04:07:50.469 align:start position:0%
basically just says if you are going to
exempt

04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
04:07:54.109 --> 04:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
your um your county your county or
 
04:07:56.550 --> 04:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal chief administrative officer
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
that you are still going to be required
 
04:08:02.030 --> 04:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
to pay your portion of the unfunded
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
liability based on that salary moving
 
04:08:07.229 --> 04:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
forward until such time is that unfunded
 
04:08:07.239 --> 04:08:08.750 align:start position:0%
forward until such time is that unfunded
liability

04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
liability
 
04:08:08.760 --> 04:08:10.830 align:start position:0%
liability
is

04:08:10.830 --> 04:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
exhausted this was this was done
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
specifically um to try to deal with some
 
04:08:17.990 --> 04:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the questions that were brought up
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
during the discussion of this in
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
reference to you know how do
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
you how do you make how does it how
 
04:08:27.790 --> 04:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
could a a position like this have its
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
debt paid off and then moving forward be
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
you know required to pay debt and what
 
04:08:34.830 --> 04:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
happens you know one versus the other
 
04:08:37.109 --> 04:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
and and the complications with that so
 
04:08:40.109 --> 04:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
the reti system found it would be the
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
easiest and the fairest to just have
 
04:08:45.389 --> 04:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
that particular governmental body
 
04:08:48.030 --> 04:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
continue to pay the unfunded liability
 
04:08:51.950 --> 04:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
portion only of that position that has
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
now been removed from the
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
um basically decertifying the position
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
position I hope I made that as
 
04:09:08.349 --> 04:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
complicated as I could thank you
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson you did an
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
excellent job there any questions for
 
04:09:12.399 --> 04:09:16.590 align:start position:0%
excellent job there any questions for
representative

04:09:16.590 --> 04:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:20.349 --> 04:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
pearon representative Shu thank you uh
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I I do take
 
04:09:23.080 --> 04:09:24.229 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I I do take
exception

04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
exception
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
to uh your position that this would be
 
04:09:32.030 --> 04:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
decertifying that position uh my
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it would just be
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the time that that individual hold
 
04:09:40.269 --> 04:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
the addition you're you're correct I
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
that you are correct that's um that is a
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
would just be true temporarily yes the
 
04:09:47.790 --> 04:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
option for for the next person in that
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
position to be in the retirement system
 
04:09:52.990 --> 04:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
would exist correct and and I would hope
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
that uh many people would want to take
 
04:10:00.750 --> 04:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of that certainly thank you
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that correction important
 
04:10:05.229 --> 04:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
because position is still in the
 
04:10:07.469 --> 04:10:07.479 align:start position:0%
retirement system it's only the indiv
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
idual person who is not
 
04:10:15.309 --> 04:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
correct are there is no one else has
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
signed up is there anyone else who
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on this
 
04:10:27.310 --> 04:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:27.320 --> 04:10:36.429 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:42.510 align:start position:0%
 
course

04:10:42.510 --> 04:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid did you have a
 
04:10:45.309 --> 04:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
question for representative Pearson or
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
Carlin I don't know what Mr Carlin is
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
gonna have to say but there's an issue I
 
04:10:53.950 --> 04:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
want to I want to make a comment but I
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
want to hear from
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
Marty we're working on getting him in so
 
04:11:02.429 --> 04:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
I thought a brief well then then if if
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
if we're hung up for a moment I can I
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
can speak to my concern and and know as
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
the chairman of Stafford
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
County delegation I I I know what it
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
means to have longer serving individuals
 
04:11:22.510 --> 04:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
in our staffing of the county we have a
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
County Administrator who is also the
 
04:11:26.910 --> 04:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator and he's been
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the position for about 30 years um it
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
was kind of casually suggested that uh
 
04:11:37.469 --> 04:11:37.479 align:start position:0%
nobody's Irreplaceable and of course
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
nobody is
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
irreplaceable but this gentleman
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh is enormously dedicated to our
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
County and does a phenomenal job I know
 
04:11:52.510 --> 04:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
what it's like to have somebody who is
 
04:11:56.590 --> 04:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
excellent uh and how important key
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
positions are uh those of us who've been
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
in the house for a while know uh
 
04:12:04.910 --> 04:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
examples of PE staffers who are maybe
 
04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
not Irreplaceable but but uh you you
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
really hate to lose them uh so to the
 
04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
degree that Marram county has found
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
somebody that has a pretty solid record
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
I'll put it that way uh to the idea that
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
we would might be by doing what we're
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
thinking of doing that we might cost
 
04:12:29.469 --> 04:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
them that person's uh you know interest
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
and and willingness to continue to serve
 
04:12:36.389 --> 04:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
that is a considerable negative aspect
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
of the whole situ
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very comment but it's
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for an executive
 
04:12:45.550 --> 04:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
session than I I understand that that's
 
04:12:47.109 --> 04:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
if we got Marty Carlin Let's us hear
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
from him Mr Carlin if you would speak to
 
04:12:54.510 --> 04:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
us uh thank you Madame chair um I just
 
04:12:57.109 --> 04:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
just wanted to sign on in case anybody
 
04:12:59.630 --> 04:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
had any questions uh B based on the
 
04:13:01.710 --> 04:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
public hearing last week and some of the
 
04:13:03.990 --> 04:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
comments made by members about the
 
04:13:07.870 --> 04:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
desire to um ensure that the employer
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
exempting the position still pays
 
04:13:12.309 --> 04:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
towards the the liability and then in
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
subsequent conversations with both um
 
04:13:16.590 --> 04:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative Shu uh we we looked for
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
some language that would um you know
 
04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
that we could administer that would meet
 
04:13:28.109 --> 04:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
that goal and actually the um assessment
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the amendment is is similar
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
to language that was in an unsuccessful
 
04:13:35.469 --> 04:13:35.479 align:start position:0%
uh bill from several years ago about
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
retirees working part-time for for
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
participating employers and at that time
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
we had done a uh analysis of Legally if
 
04:13:47.109 --> 04:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
we could um charge the unfunded piece uh
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
to the employer in these cases and um
 
04:13:51.389 --> 04:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
you know determine that our
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law was that we
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
could um and we also looked at whether
 
04:13:56.399 --> 04:13:57.469 align:start position:0%
could um and we also looked at whether
we

04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:14:00.990 --> 04:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
could uh efficiently administer that
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
that search charge through the current
 
04:14:04.950 --> 04:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
monthly contribution reporting and we
 
04:14:07.229 --> 04:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
think you know with some modifications
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh we could we could do that so it
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't produce a typ terribly undue
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
burden on either the retirement system
 
04:14:17.710 --> 04:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
or the county or or municipality to um
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
to to to to contribute so uh I just
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that we we do not have
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
a position on either the original
 
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment or this one uh you know it's a
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
policy decision that that um is within
 
04:14:32.510 --> 04:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
all of your purviews to decide if this
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
is a sensible course of action but again
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to sign up to kind of state
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
where we are we where nhrs is with that
 
04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions if anybody has
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%

04:15:44.710 --> 04:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
you should speak to your
 
04:15:47.469 --> 04:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
mtion well we uh we did a fairly
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
exhaustive uh discussion on this both
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
earlier and today so I I think we're
 
04:15:52.800 --> 04:15:56.030 align:start position:0%
earlier and today so I I think we're
good

04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
goie I think we've covered everything uh
 
04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
that needs to be
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
said is there anyone else who
 
04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
disagrees and wishes to say something
 
04:16:09.309 --> 04:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
sure thank you madam chair um I will
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
just state that um the original reason
 
04:16:20.149 --> 04:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
that I put this in was um for the
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
administrative officer for Marram County
 
04:16:26.670 --> 04:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
I have since learned that the county was
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
afraid that by the time this bill goes
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
through the process uh the time frame is
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
going to be beyond what they had hoped
 
04:16:38.670 --> 04:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
for so they are pursuing some other
 
04:16:42.750 --> 04:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
means to uh accommodate this employee
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
and and make it work but I do support
 
04:16:52.510 --> 04:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment as a small manner to fix
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
some of the lack of funding that's going
 
04:16:59.910 --> 04:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.800 --> 04:17:10.030 align:start position:0%
 
else

04:17:10.030 --> 04:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
fellows I just have a question um is
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
there any retroactive aspect to this you
 
04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
know if there's currently okay it only
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
applies to contracts entered in after
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this legislation
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
else right in that case the motion is to
 
04:17:39.229 --> 04:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment
 
04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%

all for completing all of our house
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
bills in a very timely manner and we
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
actually got two Senate bills as well so
 
04:21:42.910 --> 04:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
we're way ahead of the
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
curve we have two sem bills that we've
 
04:21:49.229 --> 04:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
heard that are we we each need to do
 
04:21:52.510 --> 04:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
some research so we will get back we're
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to take next week off and then we
 
04:21:57.469 --> 04:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
have a week with three days of session
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
and then we'll get back the week after
 
04:22:02.830 --> 04:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
that so representative
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
Schulz okay here's my out of left field
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh question or FYI from folks and I
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
should give you background of why I'm
 
04:22:13.830 --> 04:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
even asking this um I happen to live
 
04:22:16.950 --> 04:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
near uh my state representative who
 
04:22:19.950 --> 04:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
happens to also serve on finance and
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
apparently they are taking up an
 
04:22:25.389 --> 04:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed by I think Lyn o
 
04:22:28.990 --> 04:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative obber um that addresses
 
04:22:33.710 --> 04:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
the same topic that our uh emergency
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
executive order Bill uh that we
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
passed um and I thought that was
 
04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
interesting and I just was curious to
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
know if anyone had heard of that before
 
04:22:44.640 --> 04:22:47.469 align:start position:0%
know if anyone had heard of that before
our

04:22:47.469 --> 04:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
vote yeah I don't think anybody
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
referring to house or House Bill 63 it's
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
an amendment to I believe it comes into
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 no I I understand but is it the
 
04:23:04.349 --> 04:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
content that was that was in 63 or 417
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
oh um you know I don't I did hear what
 
04:23:12.229 --> 04:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
their amendment was but I don't remember
 
04:23:14.349 --> 04:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
if it mirrored one of the bills we
 
04:23:14.359 --> 04:23:15.870 align:start position:0%
if it mirrored one of the bills we
didn't

04:23:15.870 --> 04:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
04:23:19.109 --> 04:23:19.119 align:start position:0%
pass very well maybe what what I heard
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
from uh I heard that but I'm not certain
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
but I heard it was 63 I haven't heard
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
anything about anything like 417 being
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
included in
 
04:23:30.670 --> 04:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 I just thought it was interesting
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
given that we literally had just passed
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
it by almost unanimous consent and um
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
just that was overhearing this while
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
visiting neighor who happens to also be
 
04:23:41.790 --> 04:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
a State
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
Rep it is not all uncomon for bills that
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
the house feels the governor or the
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
Senate might not be happy with to be
 
04:23:55.990 --> 04:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
included in the budget everybody does it
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
and so so if if they've decided that U
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
4117 is important enough to some members
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
of Finance they'll try and get includ
 
04:24:07.389 --> 04:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
into the
 
04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
amendment but it's got to go through
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
their committee and the house so we'll
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
see see what comes out of there right
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you that I just was curious thanks
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question I guess it is
 
04:24:19.640 --> 04:24:21.189 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question I guess it is
thank

04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
you represent Schmidt do you had a
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
comment uh we had a bill a few minutes
 
04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
ago uh that where the committee was
 
04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
basically supportive of the concept but
 
04:24:35.229 --> 04:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
wanted some additional information if
 
04:24:37.950 --> 04:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
you recall the the ultimate vote was
 
04:24:41.070 --> 04:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
like 127 or something like that um and
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
you said you were going to hang on to
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
the bill um and I'm just wondering
 
04:24:48.189 --> 04:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
whether that could potentially get you
 
04:24:50.070 --> 04:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
or the committee in a little bit of hot
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
water and if so we could always do
 
04:24:56.189 --> 04:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
reconsideration right
 
04:25:00.189 --> 04:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
now and leave it open and then uh and
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
then vote subsequently on it if that
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
would potentially alleviate that
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
potential problem I don't think get me
 
04:25:09.429 --> 04:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
into trouble representative Schmidt
 
04:25:11.550 --> 04:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
because it's not up against the deadline
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of time on that and there
 
04:25:18.109 --> 04:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
is no necessity to put any house bill
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
any Senate bills through to the calendar
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
and I think the staff has enough to do
 
04:25:24.510 --> 04:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:25:27.070 --> 04:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
house representative Schmid it simply
 
04:25:32.670 --> 04:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.429 --> 04:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
forms okay well I I'm fine with leaving
 
04:25:36.750 --> 04:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
it the way it is because you're going to
 
04:25:40.349 --> 04:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
hang on to it uh and uh and the people
 
04:25:42.269 --> 04:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
who had C questions are going to ask
 
04:25:44.590 --> 04:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
them maybe they'll get the answers and
 
04:25:48.349 --> 04:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
then we'll know how to proceed uh next
 
04:25:50.990 --> 04:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
week I'm completely okay with I already
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
voted for the
 
04:25:56.189 --> 04:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
bill just wanted to verify that you do
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
not need a report for H for 106 until
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:05.000 --> 04:26:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
something

04:26:06.550 --> 04:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:26:11.950 --> 04:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.389 --> 04:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
we given could be changes exactly yes
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
you don't want to write it before you
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
know if there's an amendment okay want
 
04:26:19.870 --> 04:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
to make
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
sure again I am very very pleased that
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
we've got all the house bills through on
 
04:26:31.630 --> 04:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
on schedule and uh I will see you all on
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
8th Joy if the creek don't rise even if
 
04:26:39.720 --> 04:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
8th Joy if the creek don't rise even if
it
