January 31st
 
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
2023 the last day of January
 
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
as usual we will start our meeting by
 
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
all rising and joining representative
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:53.509 align:start position:0%
Corman as he leads us in the Pledge of
Allegiance

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you today we'll be hearing
 
00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 align:start position:0%
six bills here in St e
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
starting in just a moment with HP 234
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
relative to renewable energy credits
 
00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 align:start position:0%
at roughly 10 o'clock we'll move on to
 
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
HB 246 relative to the use of monies in
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
at 11 we'll move on to HB 161 relative
 
00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
to customer generators of electricity as
 
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
group hosts under net metering
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
after the lunch break we'll be back at 1
 
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
30 for HB 165.
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
relative to Department of energy
 
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
procedures in lieu of meeting renewable
 
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards for biomass
 
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
at 2 30 we'll move on to HB 166 relative
 
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
to the elimination of useful thermal
 
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
energy from renewable energy classes
 
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 align:start position:0%
and we'll wrap up the day at 3 30
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
approximately with HB 81 establishing a
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
study committee to examine all ancillary
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas and I had a
 
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
discussion yesterday
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
inefficient use of our time yesterday
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to be proposing to
 
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee a change in
 
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
strategy going forward but I'm going to
 
00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 align:start position:0%
wait and do that later today in the
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
hopes that more members will be here by
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
then because I'd like to like to get a
 
00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 align:start position:0%
consensus from the members about whether
 
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
or not they think our new strategy will
 
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.650 align:start position:0%
or not they think our new strategy will
work

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
so we'll do that probably right after
 
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.129 align:start position:0%
so we'll do that probably right after
lunch

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
so now we can begin one other
 
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
administrative issue I'll be leaving
 
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
here at 9 15 to go to a chairs meeting
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
so representative Thomas will take over
 
00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
so with that I think we can start and so
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
I will open the public hearing on House
 
00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 align:start position:0%
Bill 234 relative to renewable energy
 
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
credits and call on the bills Prime
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Rebecca
 
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
McWilliams to present this bill good
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
morning representative good morning
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
chair Bose good morning members of the
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee it's a pleasure to be here
 
00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 align:start position:0%
with you back-to-back days of hearings
 
00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Rebecca
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
McWilliams I represent South Concord so
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
let's talk about renewable energy
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
credits and renewable energy credit
 
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.629 align:start position:0%
credits and renewable energy credit
sweeping

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
sweeping
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
um this bill is really simple if you
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
look at the language it's simply
 
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.790 align:start position:0%
look at the language it's simply
um repeals

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
a practice that we've been doing for
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
several years that apparently
 
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.070 align:start position:0%
several years that apparently
um

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
for a lot of technical reasons that I
 
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
will get into this practice really
 
00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't serve us as a state and it also
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
appears to be against the values of
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
liberty and justice that I believe New
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was founded on
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about renewable energy
 
00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
credits and what this bill is all about
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of 29 U.S states
 
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
that have implemented a renewable
 
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
these state level policies have been
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for approximately half of
 
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
the growth in U.S renewable electricity
 
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
generation and capacity since 2000 23
 
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
years half the growth
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's renewable portfolio
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
standard or RPS is a policy that
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
obligates our electricity suppliers like
 
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
eversource Unice Hill and Liberty
 
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
to acquire a certain percentage of their
 
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
electricity mix from renewable energy
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
sources every year
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
our renewable obligations are divided
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
into four categories new renewable
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
energy is class one new solar is class
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
two class three is existing biomass and
 
00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:44.539 align:start position:0%
methane and class 4 existing small Hydro
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
there are three ways that our
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers in New Hampshire
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
can comply with the renewable energy
 
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
obligations under the RPS the first and
 
00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
generally the one that's done the most
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
is to purchase renewable energy credits
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
this was always intended to be the way
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
that our utilities ended up getting
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
energy efficient energy into their mix
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
every megawatt hour of electricity
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
generated from a renewable energy system
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
produces a renewable energy credit or a
 
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.189 align:start position:0%
produces a renewable energy credit or a
wreck

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
wreck
 
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
this is a certificate acknowledging the
 
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:21.500 align:start position:0%
potential contribution to the RPS
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers can purchase
 
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
wrecks from homeowners I have solar on
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
my house so I am able to collect wrecks
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
also from businesses municipalities or
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
other owners of renewable energy systems
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
in order for the utility to comply with
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
RPS obligations through the rec Market
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
also they can pay alternative compliance
 
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.020 align:start position:0%
payments rather than buying wrecks
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
so they pay into the renewable energy
 
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
fund and the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
uses the monarchy money that is
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
generated by these alternative
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
compliance payments to fund rebate
 
00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:56.459 align:start position:0%
programs for residential commercial
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal and low-income renewable
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
energy projects
 
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
the third option which we're not seeing
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
any of the utilities actually use is to
 
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
build Renewables obviously we have some
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
serious regulatory challenges
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
um our utilities are not actually
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to be producers so this is a
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
very rarely used option but it is the
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
third that a utility could build
 
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
renewable energy production
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
so there are multiple auctions every
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
year and prices vary for Rex nonetheless
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
currently the way the system is set up
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
there is a system called wreck sweeping
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
homeowners who have decided not to take
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of the Renewable Energy Credit
 
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.810 align:start position:0%
advantage of the Renewable Energy Credit
Market

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
Market
 
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.470 align:start position:0%
Market
um

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
will nonetheless have their wrecks
 
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
applied to the utilities of New
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the energy companies of New
 
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.410 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the energy companies of New
Hampshire

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:50.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
for for their own use basically
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
so Rex weak being is a loophole in the
 
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard that allows
 
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers to sweep up on
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
registered wrecks without paying the
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
owners of the systems that generated
 
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.570 align:start position:0%
owners of the systems that generated
them

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
the surplus of free Rex distorts the
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
market by causing wreck prices to
 
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.230 align:start position:0%
market by causing wreck prices to
collapse

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
collapse
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
wreck prices in New Hampshire are
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly low
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes less than 10 often less than
 
00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
five dollars a wreck
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
the low price of Rex is both a symptom
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
of wreck sweeping and also the cause of
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping we are in a vicious cycle
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
because prices are so low many
 
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
residential and small scale systems do
 
00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019 align:start position:0%
not bother to register and sell their
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
wrecks so it creates this culture of
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
apathy where oh if my wrecks are worth
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
so little it's not worth me going
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
through the steps to register them
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
however they're worth so little because
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
of wreck sweeping which is creating this
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg cycle where I really
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
should be getting the value of my Rex
 
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
but they've been so undervalued from
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
getting swept to the utilities that why
 
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
should I bother it's not worth my time I
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
would posit that this is probably the
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
exact opposite of what we intended to do
 
00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:58.820 align:start position:0%
back when we set up this program
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
requiring that utilities meet their
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard we've
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
created a loophole so that instead
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
they're just sweeping into it House Bill
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
234 closes the rec sweeping loophole
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
that allows utilities to take
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
unregistered wrecks from Renewable
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
Energy Systems owners at no cost the
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of clean energy policy is
 
00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:19.210 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of clean energy policy is
broken

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:19.220 align:start position:0%
broken
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to speak a little bit
 
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
more about the technicalities of the
 
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:28.550 align:start position:0%
more about the technicalities of the
program

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
as we discussed Rec sweeping enables
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
utilities and competitive Supply
 
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:35.339 align:start position:0%
suppliers to meet the overall majority
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
of their RPS obligations in specific
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's their solar obligations that
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
they're able to meet of those four
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
classes that we discussed solar is
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
really the one that's being undermined
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
by wreck Sweeping in fact more than
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of Class 2 solar obligations
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
were met with Rex in 2021
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
two-thirds swept Rex utilities got it
 
00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459 align:start position:0%
for free
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
and approximately ninety percent of the
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
obligation was likely met with swept
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
wrecks in 2022
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
um we're going to get more data on that
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
when it's published in the absence of
 
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:11.579 align:start position:0%
Rex sweeping it is fully possible that
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard could
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
have promoted 10 times the amount of
 
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
solar energy achieved and so what that
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
means is we're losing out on the benefit
 
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
of a real renewable mix which is
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
required by the RPS because Rec sweeping
 
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
just puts a Band-Aid over that
 
00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
so how's this possible ostensibly the
 
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire RPS requires utilities and
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
competitive energy suppliers to purchase
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
an increasing percentage of the energy
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
that they sell from renewable sources
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
according to the New Hampshire energy
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
fund annual report in 2022 the standard
 
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
way to demonstrate RPS compliance is for
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
the utilities and competitive suppliers
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
to either purchase or make acps we've
 
00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
talked about this
 
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
however we currently have a statute RSI
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
RSA 362 F6 Roman 2A customer generators
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
that do not undertake the burdensome
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
costly and time-consuming series of
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
actions necessary to register the
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
renewable generation with the Public
 
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and knee pool are
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
subject to what has come to be called
 
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:19.019 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping so I've handed out just a
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
very simple two-page handout that is
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
available on eversources website to
 
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
anyone who's interested in
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
how can eversource help me with
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits I'm just going
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
to skim this briefly because I want you
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
to understand that there definitely is a
 
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
burden to registering for Rex and as I
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
discussed the chicken and egg problem
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
where it's become such a hassle and it's
 
00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459 align:start position:0%
not worth a lot of money because we have
 
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
basically diluted the market and we're
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
giving utilities Wrecks for free they're
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
not paying anything for them
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
so these wrecks often go unclaimed so
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
let's just say that you install a solar
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
system at your residential home
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
um Step number one you have the solar
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
system consider engaging the services of
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
a wreck aggregator so you're not
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
required to hire a third-party wreck
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
aggregator but customers often choose to
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
work with a reg aggregator to do the
 
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
paperwork for them so there is a list of
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
Rec aggregators on eversource's website
 
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
then you need to open an account with
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
the New England power pool generation
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
information system knee pool GIS
 
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
and register your renewable energy
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
project so either you or your aggregator
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
can do this once again it's an
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
additional step you create the account
 
00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:35.459 align:start position:0%
and then it's monitored it's then you
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
need to read inside an agreement between
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
Next Step number four complete nhpuc
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
class one or Class 2 Rec eligibility
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
application so that application is also
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
available on the website more paperwork
 
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
step five you need to install an
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate Rec meter socket as part of
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
your solar energy project this is if
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
you're doing solar
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and there are guidelines for exactly
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
what that means
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
then finally you need to submit digital
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
pictures of your Rec meter socket to
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
eversource so if this sounds burdensome
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
to you you can imagine that it's
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
probably pretty burdensome to the
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
average consumer who's saying well
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
what's in it for me if I'm only going to
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
get five to ten dollars a wreck and I
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
have a very small system you know this
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
just sounds like burden some paperwork
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
and I would agree I think that that's
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
kind of the way that this has turned out
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
to be but it doesn't have to be this way
 
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
and it could be a lot better if we were
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
to get rid of sweeping racks
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
um so getting back to the technical
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
document on this once a customer
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
generator is renewable attributes
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
um have been swept by the utility
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
because they don't claim them and they
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
don't do these steps they're no longer
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
entitled to claim renewable energy they
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
generate as their own so this is more
 
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
important for commercial than for
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
residential but you're not able to
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
advertise that you are a farm run by
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
solar if you didn't claim your wrecks
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
technically they belong to your utility
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
and so you're not a farm run by solar
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
your utility gets the benefit of saying
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
they get that solar from your farm
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
um in order to legally claim and use the
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
renewable energy your solar array
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
generates you must retain exclusive
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
rights to your Energy's renewable
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
attributes including the right to
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
exclude the utilities from using your
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
Rex for RPS compliance
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
to do otherwise
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
would violate Federal anti-double
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
counting regulations and New Hampshire
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
law but New Hampshire's statutory
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
statutorially authorized practice of
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping has deprived New
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire customer generators of the
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
right to prevent electricity suppliers
 
00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
from being allocated and using swept
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
wrecks so Rec sweeping is therefore a
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
taking without notice or compensation
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
and it violates the New Hampshire
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional guarantee of property
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
right protection under part one articles
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
2 and 12. wreck sweeping has not only
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
allowed the utilities and competitive
 
00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
suppliers to evade their obligations to
 
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
promote renewable energy generation and
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
Independence in New Hampshire it is also
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
indirectly depressed wreck prices wreck
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
sweeping and low wreck prices have
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
largely gotten rid of the need for
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
electricity providers to pay alternative
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
compliance payments which would fund the
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund so here we are
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
sitting in a situation with a chicken
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
and egg and also I would say a violation
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
of our Liberty and rights by simply
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
giving away wrecks that don't belong to
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
the utilities and suddenly they can use
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
them to fulfill a different obligation
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
this in turn has reduced represents
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me are you are you near the end I
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
am one minute yep okay this in turn has
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
reduced rebates and incentives to New
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and residents that
 
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
could have spurred private investment in
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
renewable energy it's also prevented
 
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
diversification of our state's fuel
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
sources leaving us over reliant on
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
natural gas and this has contributed to
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
the current spike in electricity costs
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
because of international issues with the
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
cost of natural gas in short Rec
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
sweeping is a pernicious statutory
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
provision and it should be removed from
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
our rsas
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
so that covers my testimony and the
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
technical document that I handed out I'm
 
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about this
 
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.110 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about this
bill

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh and for an
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
excellent uh review of what the of what
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
the wreck as you call it sweeping
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
program does and doesn't do so thank you
 
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
um I've seen the representative Winnie
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
Thomas's hand up first for a question
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
good morning guys thank you Mr chair and
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for this presentation
 
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
um I just it seems pretty
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward I just have one question
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
um is anyone allowed to opt out of this
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping or is it it's just
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
overpowering and it's something that's
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
done to you
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
um so I thank you representative Wendy
 
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.010 align:start position:0%
um so I thank you representative Wendy
Thomas

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to steal the Thunder of
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
a bill that I have filed separately from
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
this bill but there is a bill to address
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
notice to folks who could potentially do
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
um do the certificates and don't realize
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
that they can and need some more notice
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
that's a separate bill but the way that
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
this works is basically if you don't opt
 
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
in and this is an opt-in process you saw
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
the seven steps with eversourced opt-in
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
if you don't opt in then you're assumed
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
to have opted out and so therefore the
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
utility can sweep your wrecks okay thank
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um and uh may I suggest uh not
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
in this case but on any questions the
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
answers please be direct to the question
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
and uh for time considerations uh any
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
further explanation perhaps should be
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
hell for a further question this will
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
become more important when the cheer
 
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
discusses our strategy for bills coming
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
in in the future uh representative
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
JD Bernardi another question
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
um so you call this a loophole yet it is
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
law defined set of uh
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
principles and characterized in the law
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
and if we were to end it
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
would not that increase the cost to rate
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
payers by raising the cost of
 
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.049 align:start position:0%
payers by raising the cost of
electricity

00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi to the first
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
part where I called this a loophole that
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
tends to be the nature of what happens
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
with legislation we as a body pass
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
multiple bills in multiple years and
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes they differ sometimes one new
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
bill changes a previous bill that's
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much what happened in this
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
situation where we had a goal for the
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and then
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
later on WE introduced as a legislature
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
Rec sweeping that pretty much undermines
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
the goal so it created that situation I
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
called a loophole because the utilities
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
could choose not to do it but they all
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
choose to do it it's the simplest
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
easiest way to meet the requirement and
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
we haven't patched the loophole to
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
prevent that and get back on track with
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
our goals for the renewable portfolio
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
standard the second piece of your
 
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
question about how the cost is allocated
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
there is certainly a value to Rex and so
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
whoever decides to install a solar array
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
could collect on that value of those
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
wrecks they've constructed it they've
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
put money in their probably paying a
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
long-term loan payment to pay off the
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
solar that they installed at their
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
property and so they are entitled to the
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
value of those wrecks when they're sold
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
at auction and when they choose not to
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
get them that value of the Rex is then
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to the utilities so what we're
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
essentially doing is a taking without
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
permission of the folks who either
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
failed to forgot to didn't know they had
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
to get wrecks or decided it wasn't worth
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
their value suddenly that money is
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
shifted over to the utility
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
so when you talk about overall cost to
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
the consumers of New Hampshire right now
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're allowing the
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
utilities to have free money from people
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
who spent their own money to create
 
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
these wrecks and that's not right it's
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
not fair
 
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
but yes of course it has hurt the market
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
and it has underinflated the value of
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
the Rex and therefore once we correct
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
the market there will be an increased
 
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
value and an increased distributed cost
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
which is what it should have been all
 
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
along on the ratepayers of New Hampshire
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
who have been generally benefiting from
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
this program that unfairly takes wrecks
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
from people who have already invested in
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
and don't realize or don't know or in
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
some cases don't think it's worth it to
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
get the value in the aggregate the value
 
00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:39.419 align:start position:0%
is significant but for individual
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
projects and individual bills very very
 
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.730 align:start position:0%
projects and individual bills very very
small

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
a lot follow-up so
 
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299 align:start position:0%
so you acknowledge that by eliminating
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
this program we would increase cost
 
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:57.539 align:start position:0%
overall cost of electricity to Consumers
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
point one and you acknowledge the fact
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
that the legislature deliberately
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
created the program
 
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
to allow this to occur
 
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I want to be very clear how I respond
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
to representative Bernardi I think to
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
point one
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
when we talk about installing new solar
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
across the entire State we're talking
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
about increasing our diversity in our
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
mix which overall will decrease the cost
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
of natural gas which is what we're
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
relying on because we have other sources
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
to rely upon so in the 10-year plan
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
which is really what my focus is on this
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
saves everyone money by getting us back
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
to the renewable portfolio standard but
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
yes you are correct in the short term if
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
we are counting pennies there is a cost
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
to everyone to get back to that plan
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
okay yeah in interest of time I'll allow
 
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
one more question
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
okay so so again what you're saying is
 
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.310 align:start position:0%
okay so so again what you're saying is
by

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
allowing the utilities to take
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
Rex which have been abandoned by the
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
their uh their owners
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
it would increase the cost of power
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
overall to the customer base
 
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say that no I'm sorry I think
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
you and I differ on how this is actually
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
executed I would say that it corrects
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
the market and therefore over time saves
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:35.149 align:start position:0%
 
bye

00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.649 --> 00:24:38.659 align:start position:0%
uh before I call the next oops okay
 
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
represent Harrington has a question
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm trying to figure this out
 
00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned a couple of times about
 
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
Distortion of the market and
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
um illegal taking but uninfect directs a
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
simply they just Fiat that was created
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
by the legislature anybody could put up
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
a solar panel any place they want but it
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
has no wreck value except for the law
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
that was created that Awards them values
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
there's no intrinsic value to their
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
product other than the electricity they
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
sell they get to sell that and then
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
above and beyond they get this Fiat
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
money which was just by the power of the
 
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
state is that not correct I mean
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
basically a wreck is only valuable
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
because the state says the utilities
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
must buy them
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:27.059 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington a wreck has
 
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
value because we've created a market for
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
that wreck there is a actual tangible
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
dollar value for every single auction
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
that happens multiple times a year for
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
these wrecks there is a real dollar
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
value that is then swept to the
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
utilities so we've created as a
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
legislature just like we as the federal
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
government could create money we could
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
print money it's the same sort of thing
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislatively we've created that market
 
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.350 align:start position:0%
legislatively we've created that market
follow-up

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.909 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
I I guess what I'm confused on is it
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
seems like you the the state is awarding
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
something a piece of paper for every
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
megawatt of qualified electricity that's
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
produced that paper has no value other
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
than the fact that the state has created
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
a market so how can the state taking
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
some of that back be an illegal taking
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
because it's a totally a creation of the
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
state to begin with nobody has a
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to Iraq do they I
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
mean is there some part of the
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution I missed that talks about
 
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
we've created this market we've created
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
a supply and demand and therefore we've
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
created a value and yes there is a
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
dollar value for every wreck it varies
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
per auction but there is a dollar value
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately right now that dollar
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
value is just being awarded to the
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
utilities I would say that we need to
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
stop this practice in order to make sure
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
that the value we've created is honored
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
one quick follow-up Mr chairman you must
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up and let's very very
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
quick when you say awarded to the
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
utilities in fact you do mean the
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
utilities don't make a profit they just
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
simply pass whatever that award is to
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
the rate payers in the form of lower
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
rates is that not correct
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
the utilities are able to meet their
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard by sweeping
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
these solar wrecks and therefore they do
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
not need to make alternative compliance
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
payments those are real dollars those
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
are dollars avoided so when we talk
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
about money we're talking about the
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
utilities being able to save money by
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
not having to spend money to purchase
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing no other questions thank
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative partial uh please in the
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
interest of time a quick question
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
let's just be the last one please thank
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
you chair
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing uh on the paper you handed
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
out uh
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
your uh paragraph five mentions the
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
other source Rec meter socket
 
00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:53.090 align:start position:0%
other source Rec meter socket
requirements

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
and this is somewhat new to me could you
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
please tell me if I
 
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
do I have to have one of them installed
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
or can they estimate
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
what the wrecks are produced and sweep
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
on that basis
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
you know I'm probably not the right
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
person to answer this question about the
 
00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
eversource meter socket I think that's
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
probably a little more technical there
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
will be people after me who can respond
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
to that better well I hope so I wanted
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
to goodness in case we don't have ever
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
Source here today thank you
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay say uh I'm gonna call on thank you
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony I'll call
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
on the next um
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
uh testifier which will be the honorable
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
Lee auctionham welcome back to the
 
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.190 align:start position:0%
Lee auctionham welcome back to the
committee

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good to be back
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
um Lee auction I'm speaking for myself
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
the fundamental purpose of this bill is
 
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:54.500 align:start position:0%
to put in indirect sweepings
 
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking of customer
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
generators property that is the
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes of their renewable
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
energy generation it's not created by
 
00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
Fiat by the state it's created at the
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
moment the energy is produced and as the
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
doe testified last week renewable
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
attributes are the property that makes
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
renewable energy renewable renewable
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
energy has a great value in the market
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
and this loophole is something that is
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
done by the state not by the utilities
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
this is a taking by the state of the
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
property of New Hampshire residents and
 
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
businesses it is done without their
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge or consent or any compensation
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
that is not legal
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
first wreck sweeping is it taking
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
because electricity providers are
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
enabled to use customer generators
 
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
property for their own purposes using
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
your property for their purposes
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
is it taking because in so doing it
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
prevents the customer generator from
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
being able to use their own property in
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
their own interests denying the property
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
owner the use of their property and it
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
is also a taking because it makes the
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
original owner liable to prosecution
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
thank you for staying for my testimony
 
00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:10.850 align:start position:0%
thank you for staying for my testimony
sir

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
due to anti-double-counting rules and
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
laws against false advertising
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
further well with the test fire suspend
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
please direct your testimony to the to
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh beside instead of other
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
side comments please
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
thank you sir I was answering his
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
question and I
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me for
 
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
the aside
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
although we keep being told that swept
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
wrecks go to public utilities to meet
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
their RPS obligation and indirectly that
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
should lower rates by an inconsequential
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
amount almost exactly half of the total
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
goes to private corporations mostly out
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
of state multi-billion dollar
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
corporations like Constellation Energy
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
those funds are not being used to lower
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
rates they are being used by for private
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
purposes by those corporations probably
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
going to their shareholders
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier if you separate the
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes from the
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
electricity produced by renewable source
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
that energy is no longer renewable it is
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%
classified by the FTC as null
 
00:31:12.059 --> 00:31:13.789 align:start position:0%
classified by the FTC as null
electricity

00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
all the renewable attributes and we
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
commonly slur this over and refer to
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
them as wrecks
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
all the renewable attributes for
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard compliance
 
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.370 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard compliance
legally

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
legally
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
become part of the electricity the
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
providers Supply and RPS anti-double
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
counting rules prohibit anyone else from
 
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
claiming they also use those same
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes as something they
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
produce or consume that's the problem
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
with double County the only way you can
 
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
prevent double counting is to ensure
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
only one owner to those renewable
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
attributes if they are swept they now
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
belong to whoever holds the wreck which
 
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
is the legal title to the renewable
 
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
attributes the certificate is not the
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
property the renewable attributes are
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
the property
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
federal law I'll give you 30 seconds
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
please Federal also prohibits customer
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
generators from claiming to use
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
renewable energy they produce if it's
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
counted towards an RPS mandate wreck
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
sweeping also renders null and void the
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
customer generator's intention to move
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
off of fossil fuels it subverts their
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
intent to make additional renewable
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
energy beyond the legally mandated
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
minimum in order to accelerate the clean
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
energy transition and finally it's a
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
double whammy by producing energy that
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
meets their own needs customer
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
generators already reduce the total
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
amount of energy subject to compliance
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
requirements and because the RPS only
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
applies to electricity that this
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
utilities and the private companies sell
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
so the state's already applying swept
 
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
wrecks against an already reduced RPS
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
obligation the net result we would have
 
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
had more renewable energy in New
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if all of those residents
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
thousands and businesses had never
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
invested their hard-earned money at all
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
if if uh thank you chair and thank you
 
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:13.340 align:start position:0%
representative take my question
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
so right now the relax that the
 
00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.630 align:start position:0%
so right now the relax that the
customers

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
customers
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
do not apply for within one year if I
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
believe that's the agreement right as it
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
is now the utilities sweep them
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
and this bill proposes instead of the
 
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
utilities taking their property the
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
state will take the property
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
for what the state believes is a better
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
use if you would like to
 
00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:47.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker often used the term
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
claimed or unclaimed the issue here is
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
that this it it's not that the utilities
 
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
are claiming the wrecks what the
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
utilities do is they fill out a form and
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
they say how much electricity they sold
 
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
the state then applies a formula to that
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
and credits them with Rex that they have
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
not paid for
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
that the actual owners of the renewable
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
attributes the original owners who
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
invested their money who generated the
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
electricity who think they're using
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
renewable energy those people have lost
 
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
the value of their renewable attributes
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
because of the states taking of their
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
property without their knowledge consent
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
or compensation
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
did that answer the question or did I
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
you got me confused when you mentioned
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you
 
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
for Clear uh thank you sir for
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
when this when the utilities
 
00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:57.349 align:start position:0%
when this when the utilities
sweep

00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
sweep
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
and become
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
the person who is property presumed
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
cannot use them now how does when the
 
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
state takes them that person gets that
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
value from the state so it's because
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
otherwise they lose either way they
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
don't get that value and it's their
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
decision not to
 
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
it's only your decision if you know
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
about the process
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned there is a bill
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
about notifying people that this process
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
exists and has been going on for about a
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
decade so people who are being harmed
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
are unaware of it people who put who put
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
their house on the market and say the
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
house is solar
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh powered can be sued for false
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
advertising people who businesses who
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
put uh panels on their roofs and then
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
say our manufacturing process is
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
renewable or even if they use a picture
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
of their Factory with the with the
 
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
renewable energy shown it's false
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
advertising if you've sold your wrecks
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
you do not have renewable energy you are
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
not producing renewable energy that
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
value has been lost it's been taken by
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
the state and transferred not just to
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
the utilities but to private
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
corporations almost fully have it's
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
something like 47.9 percent
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
goes to private corporations for private
 
00:36:28.849 --> 00:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
uses does not reduce rate payers
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
bills by ascent
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
and where it does produce some savings
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
okay seeing other questions and I'll
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead last one
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so you declared that
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
this reps week sweeping is
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
yet the state created the wrecks and
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
created the program by which there is
 
00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:04.550 align:start position:0%
created the program by which there is
sweeping

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
sweeping
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
in the in the exact same program so I
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't understand how that can be an
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh one of the
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
new reps I understand was with
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
wheelabrader at one time is a very
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
famous federal law case with
 
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
wheelabrader about Rex wrecks are not
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
the property they are the certificate
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes are created at the
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
moment of Generation by the generator
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
those attributes are being taken by the
 
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
state under this program the state
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.530 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
so if you have a solar array on your on
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
your home or in your yard and you don't
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
apply for the wrecks you are still
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
getting the value of the solar
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
generation for your property whether or
 
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.690 align:start position:0%
generation for your property whether or
not you

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
not you
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
apply for the Rex or sell the Rex you
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
still get the power
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
okay first of all the important point is
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's the registering of the Rex the
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
registering can cost thousands of
 
00:38:18.609 --> 00:38:18.619 align:start position:0%
dollars the burdensome
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
series of things you have to do
 
00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
particularly the electric socket getting
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
the electrician in all those things are
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
costs which you're saying to protect my
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
property I have to go through this
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
burdensome process I have to spend
 
00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars so that the state
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
won't take my property and give it to
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
private corporations and the utilities
 
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
that is an unfounded statement and I'm
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
sorry there was a second part to that
 
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.950 align:start position:0%
sorry there was a second part to that
question

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
the no the print the principal part is
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you have the array you are getting
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
the solar power
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
run your home or run your business the
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
um when the state runs this formula to
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
apply the Rex to those who shouldn't be
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
getting them they take your entire
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
generation even the generation that you
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
used in your house you did not use
 
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
renewable energy because it was taken
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
from you you used null electricity
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
legally you did not have title you
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
cannot claim that your house or your
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
business is renewable energy powered
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
because it isn't someone else has taken
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
the legal claim
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
to that renewable attribute which is the
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
essential property right of renewable
 
00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:33.410 align:start position:0%
essential property right of renewable
energy

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
a company that that runs its facility
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
entirely on the basis of coal if they
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
buy enough wrecks they can say we use
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
renewable energy we're renewably powered
 
00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:47.099 align:start position:0%
because they are the legal owners of the
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we're going to move on
 
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
here thank you for Testimony uh The
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
Honorable Lee oxnaham and I'm sure that
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
the next testifier can perhaps shed some
 
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
light on the previous testimonies uh to
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
the the pros and cons so I have one more
 
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:11.780 align:start position:0%
I have one last speaker here if anyone
 
00:40:13.569 --> 00:40:13.579 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
comment on what was said so far
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
particularly involving the utilities
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
please have a pink card come up to me so
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
right now I'll call on uh Mr Griffin
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
Roberts from Department of energy for
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
his testimony
 
00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:57.910 align:start position:0%
his testimony
foreign

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
before we begin again uh for both
 
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
testimony and answers to questions
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
please directly answer the question and
 
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
try to refrain from going a little bit
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
further off Target if it doesn't apply
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
directly to the question thank you
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh representative Thomas
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge stanji program manager
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
energy what I passed around a few
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
moments ago was just a three-page
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
outline of how the RPS functions I
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
figured that might be relevant for all
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
of the RPS related bills that we're
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
going to be discussing today
 
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
um I do apologize for the second page it
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
is upside down
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
um uh it came out of the printer
 
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
incorrectly this morning uh so please
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
bear with me on that but um I figured
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
I'd share that just as a reference point
 
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the RPS bills that we'll be
 
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:53.900 align:start position:0%
discussing today
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
circling back
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
um to this bill House Bill 234 the New
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy is
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill as introduced as has
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
been mentioned uh the bill repeals a
 
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
statutory provision in the RPS statute
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
allowing for a credit uh against an
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers RPS obligation under
 
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
class one and two for customer cited
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
sources that are net metered and for
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
which renewable energy credits have not
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
been issued
 
00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:21.950 align:start position:0%
been issued
um

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
just for background
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
um I do want to point uh the committee
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
to a statutorily mandated review of the
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
RPS that last occurred in 2018.
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
um this credit mechanism was actively
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
discussed uh during that time through a
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
collaborative stakeholder engagement
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
process uh held at the puc when they
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
manage the program in that review there
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
was no consensus among stakeholders on
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
the future of this crediting mechanism
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
some argued in favor of retaining the
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
credit as it reduces overall cost of RPS
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
compliance to ratepayers and to electric
 
00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:02.099 align:start position:0%
suppliers others felt that the credit
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
should be eliminated to increase the
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
market for class II renewable energy
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
credits at that time in 2018 the puc
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
agreed that the credit is a reasonable
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
policy to retain because it recognizes
 
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
the renewable attributes of all eligible
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
solar PV cited facilities in New
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including those that are not
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
currently certified to produce wrecks
 
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
additionally because these net metered
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
facilities for which the credit is being
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
claimed likely received financial
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
support from the state's renewable
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
energy fund under the RPS the energy
 
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
generated from those facilities should
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
contribute to the state's overall RPS
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
goals so in that context the passage of
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
um would likely prevent net Merit
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
facilities who received ref financial
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
support from contributing to the state's
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
RPS goals the crediting mechanism and
 
00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
statute is meant to capture those
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
facilities that aren't Rec certified and
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
without the credit they do not unless
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
they become recertified on their own
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
um in the in the review the puc
 
00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:11.420 align:start position:0%
concluded that the capacity factor used
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the class II credit was too high at
 
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
the time it was 20 percent they felt
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
that that capacity factor for certain so
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
for solar facilities was too high and a
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
little bit off of uh realistic data so
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
they did recommend amending statute to
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
reduce that capacity factor from 20
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
percent to 14 which is more in line with
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh with historical data for these for
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
these uh for these systems that
 
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
amendment was made in 2021 through House
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 309 which reduced the capacity
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
factor from 20 percent to a capacity
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
Factor equal to isonial England's annual
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
PV energy forecast this changed just
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
occurred in 2001 and a little bit of a
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
little bit as shown in the past
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
compliance here so that change has
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
modestly increased the amount of wrecks
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
that electric suppliers must procure
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
underclass 2 but again I do want to
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
emphasize that it is modest
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
um that really concludes my testimony on
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm happy to take any
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.329 --> 00:45:17.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I will call
 
00:45:21.609 --> 00:45:21.619 align:start position:0%
on representative Summers for a question
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
this is a question I have and it's been
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
bewildering to me so I'm going to try to
 
00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
make make it very brief but uh
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
my constituents I know are right now are
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
paying in my area paying around 25 27
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt and we've heard
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
multiple bills about increasing rates
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
for their supposed benefit now speaking
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
directly to this bill how much would the
 
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
rates of our my constituents go up if
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
this was passed thank you for the
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
question so I'll try to unpack that a
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
little bit and feel free to stop me or
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
cut me off if I'm if I'm going off the
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
rails so
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
um to back up the credit mechanism is
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
used as a way to capture uh net metered
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state that are not
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
currently certified to produce wrecks so
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
if you guys
 
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:17.099 align:start position:0%
um were to look at page two of the
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
um of the hand that I provided you'll
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
see on the right hand side that in order
 
00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:23.579 align:start position:0%
to become certified to produce wrecks
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
you need to Mr
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
um excuse me please I'm I'm terribly
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I need to make an announcement
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
there is a policy in this room to have
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
no signs uh in this room so with the
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
visitor that's here please
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
put her sign outside in the hallway if
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
if you would please we have a policy of
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
those signs
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
please it is a policy
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
please put your sign outside
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
if you wish to testify you can fill out
 
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair so I'm
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
sorry for the interruption please
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
continue so um
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
in order to create renewable energy
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
credits uh Facility Owners need to be
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
registered in order to do so and to do
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
so you must uh work with a independent
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
monitor or a Rec aggregator who can
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
measure the output of your facility to
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
that would then generate Rex and then
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
you were actually producing Rex if you
 
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:32.339 align:start position:0%
are not certified to do that you're not
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
producing wrecks the way the credit
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
mechanism is meant to function is that
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's meant to capture those who are
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
currently net mirrored not rec certified
 
00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
but likely received support from the
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
state's renewable energy fund under the
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
RPS to capture the uh to capture the
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
output that those facilities made the
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
light the anticipated wrecks that they
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
would have likely created and and could
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
and make sure that those wrecks
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
contribute to the state's overall RPS
 
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:05.780 align:start position:0%
goals repealing the credit would
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
potentially allow some who receive
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
support from the renewable energy fund
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
to walk away and not have any means of
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
actually crediting their output to the
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
state's RPS goals that's one your
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
question regarding impact to ratepayers
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
repealing this credit would likely
 
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
increase the need for electric suppliers
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
such as eversource such as consolation
 
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:30.380 align:start position:0%
so those folks to procure Class 2 rex
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
that would likely uh lead to an
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase in RPS
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
compliance costs as folks need to as
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers need to procure
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
additional Wrecks for that category but
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
on the on the on the other side is that
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
is there an argument to be made about
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
solar facilities reducing a state's
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
transmission costs and that type of
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing there is an argument to be made
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you uh in the interest of time I
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
will take one more question from
 
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
representative munz please before we
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
move on to our next uh thank you Mr
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you again for coming in
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to follow up on that last
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
comment you made about the process of
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
um certifying Rex
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
um if someone has not taken the time
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
effort to get their their their
 
00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.930 align:start position:0%
effort to get their their their
um

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
but their certificate certified
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
how then is it how then can that can the
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
value of that energy
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
be used by a utility to to fulfill their
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
Rec requirement if it's not a certified
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
wreck uh thank you for the question
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
um I think the answer would be that this
 
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
credit mechanism does that is that it is
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
meant to capture those facilities that
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
maybe aren't Rec certified and as we
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
heard today there are certainly hurdles
 
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
for smaller systems to get Rec certified
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
and produce those wrecks I'm not
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
doubting that
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
um but the crediting mechanism is a way
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
to capture those facilities that are to
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
capture those facilities that maybe ha
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
don't want to incur the burden of
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
becoming Rec certified capture the
 
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
potential output from those facilities
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
credit them to the state's RPS
 
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
um RPS goals in a way make sure they're
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
contributing to the state's renewable
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
energy policies without the credit you
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
could potentially have folks out there
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
who you know are you know have solar PVC
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
facilities net metering facilities but
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
there isn't a way to capture any
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
anticipated wrecks that they may have
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
created if they were Rec certified
 
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
hopefully that makes sense but more than
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
willing to unpack that if need be thank
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
you uh if you will a quick follow-up if
 
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
it only if it's a quick answer
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
well um we'll see
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
I I guess I want to come back to the the
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
comments that we heard from the the last
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
presenter is that so how is that not a
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
taking of personal property I thank you
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
for the question I am certainly not a
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
lawyer I am not going to pretend to be
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
one so I know that there was some
 
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:06.140 align:start position:0%
earlier discussion about
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional taking and that type of
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
thing I don't want to necessarily get
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
into that because I know I'm not going
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
to be well versed in it
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
um but I think my answer would be that
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
the crediting mechanism in statute which
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
it was created back in 2010 I'm sorry
 
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.630 align:start position:0%
it was created back in 2010 I'm sorry
2012

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
2012
 
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
um has been in existence for some time
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any Constitution any
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
any type of unconstitutional claims
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
being made in the court or anything like
 
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.750 align:start position:0%
being made in the court or anything like
that

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
um it's just what's currently in statue
 
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
in the legislature has mandated thank
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
Mr robersh and your answer to the
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
questions I'd like to move on please to
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
our next testifier Mr locata from
 
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.870 align:start position:0%
our next testifier Mr locata from
eversource

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll have some more questions
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
here as well in the interest of time
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
good morning Michael Licata representing
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
eversource energy
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
um ever sources is neutral on the bill
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
this is truly a public policy decision
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
that the legislature uh makes but
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
um if folks have any questions I am
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
happy to either do my best to answer
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
them now or take them back and try to
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
provide an answer at a future date
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
well I think uh
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
as a chair I will ask a question in
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
previous years when this bill has come
 
00:52:28.569 --> 00:52:28.579 align:start position:0%
up uh we have learned from eversource
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
that it would increase the residence
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
still true if if this bill were to pass
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
would people's residents electric bills
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
increase and why
 
00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
so that is correct
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
um so unused wrecks that are
 
00:52:59.049 --> 00:52:59.059 align:start position:0%
used wrecks that are not used by the
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
system owner are used to reduce the
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
utilities RPS compliance obligations
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
which reduces the number of renewable
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
energy credits that the utility has to
 
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.450 align:start position:0%
energy credits that the utility has to
purchase

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
thereby reducing the cost of compliance
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
with the RPS
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
if those unused wrecks were not allowed
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
to be used by the utility it would
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
increase the number of wrecks the
 
00:53:30.849 --> 00:53:30.859 align:start position:0%
utility would have to purchase
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
increasing the compliance costs with the
 
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.329 align:start position:0%
increasing the compliance costs with the
RPS

00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
RPS
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
as my follow-up does that mean when you
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
say it will increase your costs does
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
that mean that that being a cost of
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
business would be folded into your next
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
rate hike request
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
yes the cost of the RPS compliance are
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
included in the Energy Service cost uh
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
so that is a direct pass-through to
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
uh Colin representative partial
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
yes sure thank you for my question and
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today
 
00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
um one thing which I've heard several
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
times here and I wonder if you can
 
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
enlighten me on this
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
by avoiding the cost of a compliance
 
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
and not having to meet that standard
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
you're saying these savings are passed
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
on consumers
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
are any savings passed on to
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
shareholders as well now and how can you
 
00:54:36.849 --> 00:54:36.859 align:start position:0%
be sure of that I'm sorry follow up
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
and can you tell me the process by
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's uh you can certainly yeah our RPS
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
compliance costs are strictly regulated
 
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
by the Public Utilities Commission the
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
reduction in the compliance the number
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
of wrecks that the utility has to
 
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.730 align:start position:0%
of wrecks that the utility has to
purchase

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
um is actually comes from the Public
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission I think now the
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy since the
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
separation so uh the calculation on the
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
reduction is actually done by a state
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
agency and then that number is provided
 
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
to the utility to say You must purchase
 
00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
X number of wrecks to be compliant so
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
as with default service it is a a
 
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.170 align:start position:0%
as with default service it is a a
pass-through

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
pass-through
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
I understand thank you so much
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
um

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative partial already uh zeroed
 
00:55:38.049 --> 00:55:38.059 align:start position:0%
in on my subject matter the the we were
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
told that some of these wrecks are
 
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
bought by outside utilities but any
 
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.910 align:start position:0%
bought by outside utilities but any
utility

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
utility
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
buying a wreck or sweeping a wreck
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
it it would would go into the electric
 
00:55:58.730 --> 00:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
generation cost of the utility that is
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
passed it's a direct pass-through to the
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
customer so if they swept the rep it's
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
going to be a reduction in the rate to
 
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
the customer is that not true so
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
I can only speak for
 
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
regulated distribution utilities and how
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
we comply with our RPS obligations
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
I cannot speak to third-party
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers that were
 
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.150 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers that were
referenced

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
how they use those wrecks and how it
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
impacts their costs so I can really only
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
speak to how eversource as a rate
 
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.490 align:start position:0%
speak to how eversource as a rate
regulated

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:36.500 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
00:56:40.089 --> 00:56:40.099 align:start position:0%
distribution utility whose
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
charges and rates are are scrutinized
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
and approved by the Public Utilities
 
00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:48.059 align:start position:0%
Commission so I I can't speak to third
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
so this would also apply just follow up
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
sorry this would apply to Unitil and uh
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
and Liberty and all the the utilities of
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire treated the same way with
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
respect to wreck sweeping Unitil Liberty
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
and the co-op yeah are all responsible
 
00:57:13.809 --> 00:57:13.819 align:start position:0%
to comply with the RPS thank you so
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
bottom line we're eliminating
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
rate payer costs by allowing utilities
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
to sweep these wrecks
 
00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:26.990 align:start position:0%
to sweep these wrecks
correct

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
um in the um testimony that the uh the
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor provided she gave us a
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
handout that references the eversource
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
rec meter socket requirement
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
um can you explain what that is and how
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
that works I I'm afraid I I I'm not
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with the handout but I would be
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take a copy and provide a
 
00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.010 align:start position:0%
happy to take a copy and provide a
response

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question uh
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you Mr Lakota
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.670 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'll let you finish taking you no no
 
00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:10.690 align:start position:0%
I'll let you finish taking you no no
please

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:10.700 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
concerning the meters an owner has to
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
get a special sounds like a costly meter
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
and you had mentioned uh
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
that this the sweeping or the utilities
 
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
measures a potential
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
um Rex because there's no meter how does
 
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
um the utilities
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
determine how much is produced in
 
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
attributes to add up to a wreck
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding the question I
 
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:44.839 align:start position:0%
apologize if I'm not
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
this program applies to net metering
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
customers who participate in net
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
metering and so we do track their their
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
usage and their production and that is
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh thank you profile uh thank you Mr La
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
Carta I had forgotten that one part of
 
00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.890 align:start position:0%
Carta I had forgotten that one part of
it

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh in in having to
 
00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:23.900 align:start position:0%
pay uh alternative compliance payments
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
uh you're you're obviously increasing
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
your costs does that increase costs have
 
00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
a one-to-one relationship to your rates
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
or is there a specific formula as to how
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
that gets distributed into the rates
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
um so the first point I'd like to make
 
00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.890 align:start position:0%
um so the first point I'd like to make
is

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
um the utilities and I think I I can I
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
think this is true of all the utilities
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
um very much try to purchase Rex as
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to Alternative compliance
 
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.990 align:start position:0%
opposed to Alternative compliance
payments

00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
um that is our our goal not to just pay
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
into a fund but rather to
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that the RPS is functioning the
 
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
way that it's intended to which is to
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
incent the development
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
um of renewable generation or preserve
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
existing I think the question though
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
whether it's rex or or alternative
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
compliance payments whether that's one
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
to one it is a direct pass-through our
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
compliance costs are directly paid by uh
 
01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.349 align:start position:0%
compliance costs are directly paid by uh
customers

01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas asked a
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
um just trying to get a number here um
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
in 2021 eversource made a profit of 1.2
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
billion do you have the numbers for 2022
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
any follow-up no I'm sorry okay
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question this
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
will be the last question for this
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
public hearing thanks Mr chair
 
01:00:58.559 --> 01:00:59.450 align:start position:0%
public hearing thanks Mr chair
um

01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
when we when we talk about uh rates
 
01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.370 align:start position:0%
when we when we talk about uh rates
um

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
while there may be a short-term impact
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
on rates isn't it true that money that
 
01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
on rates isn't it true that money that
um

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
you may have to pay into the alternate
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
you know for alternative compliance
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
payments that goes into the renewable
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
energy fund and that that has a longer
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
term positive benefit on rates
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
the way that the RPS is intended to
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
function is the utilities and I I keep
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
saying the utilities but it really is uh
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
suppliers of electricity which include
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
utilities and and third parties
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
um have specific percentage obligations
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
to purchase renewable energy credits and
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
when they are unable to do so
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
the program essentially has a financial
 
01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
cap called the alternative compliance
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
payment and that does go into the fund
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
the way the program is intended to
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
function is those alternative compliance
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
payments then incent the development
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
through rebates of renewable generation
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
which provides a source of Rex to avoid
 
01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
the supplier of energy from having to
 
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
purchase an alternate make an
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment in the
 
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
future so there's sort of a virtuous
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
cycle there to try to increase increased
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
demand so uh to It's a Long Way of of
 
01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:26.660 align:start position:0%
trying to answer the question to say
 
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:29.339 align:start position:0%
alternative compliment compliance
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
payments that go into the renewable
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
energy fund if they function the way
 
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
that they're intended to should create a
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
supply of wrecks for the utilities and
 
01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:39.559 align:start position:0%
suppliers to purchase in the future
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
avoiding the necessity of purchasing of
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
making alternative compliance payments
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
in future years
 
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr locata for your
 
01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
testimony and with that I'm going to
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:59.390 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
234

01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
and since we're already a little bit
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
late I'm gonna open a public hearing
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
after we hear about the blue sheet for
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
this bill House Bill 234
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
Mr representative closure could you give
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
us the the statistics uh thank you chair
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 234
 
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet was three in favor
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
none opposed online was 117 in favor for
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
a post
 
01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
thank you and I just remind members that
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
that online number is a snapshot of what
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
the situation was at about nine o'clock
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
this morning and it could change
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
substantially by midnight tonight
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll open the public
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 246 which is
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
relative to the uses of monies in the
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and I'll call
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
first to the stand the sponsor of this
 
01:04:01.809 --> 01:04:01.819 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Janine notter
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
chairman and good morning members of the
 
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.230 align:start position:0%
chairman and good morning members of the
committee

01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.430 align:start position:0%
committee
so

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
before I begin my testimony just one to
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
start by defining RPS RPS is
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard which
 
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
is a set of laws requiring Electric
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
utilities to buy Power from solar and
 
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
wind producers at higher prices than
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
charged by fossil fuel producers of
 
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.130 align:start position:0%
charged by fossil fuel producers of
electricity

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
so this bill is pretty straightforward
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
right now utilities by renewable energy
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
certificates called Rex to meet their
 
01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard RPS
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
obligations or they pay alternative
 
01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
compliance payments acps for example
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
many of the state's competitive
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
suppliers of electricity purchase acps
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
instead of Rex to avoid the
 
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
administrative expense of purchasing
 
01:04:51.059 --> 01:04:52.370 align:start position:0%
administrative expense of purchasing
wrecks

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
acps go into the renewable energy fund
 
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.569 align:start position:0%
acps go into the renewable energy fund
ref

01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
ref
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
those payments then go out as subsidies
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
for solar arrays wood stove
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
installations and other non-residential
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects located in New
 
01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.589 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects located in New
Hampshire

01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
for example one such project replaced
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
two turbines and three valves boosting
 
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
capacity to 0.44 megawatts at one
 
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facility
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
this bill would rebate those ref dollars
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
back to the rate payers employing the
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
same mechanism that the Public Utilities
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
Commission uses to rebate Reggie
 
01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
proceeds back to rate payers Regional
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative it would be
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
uniform across the board on a per
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
kilowatt basis these rebates would lower
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity for the state's
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
rate payers
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
as written this change would be
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
permanent I plan to offer an amendment
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
to make this change temporary for a
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
two-year period
 
01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
I will it will have wording along the
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
lines of within 60 days of Passage it
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
will require the puc to start the
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
proceedings to deter determine how to
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
distribute ref Monies to ratepayers
 
01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
if you look at the website for the
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy you can read the
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
RPS energy fund annual report dated
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
October 1st 2022.
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
scrolling down to table 2 you will find
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
the acp's revenues by compliance year
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
for 2021 the total was just over 7
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
with this bill that amount would be
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
given back to the rate payers even this
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
modest change will help struggling
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
families who can afford who can't afford
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
to buy eggs or gas up the car their car
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
these days and it will help to chip away
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
at all the different taxes and fees that
 
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
are taken from them and redistributed
 
01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.329 align:start position:0%
are taken from them and redistributed
elsewhere

01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
and I have a constituent down the hall
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
that I I need to go support on another
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm not going to be taking
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
questions so I will leave them for the
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
people testifying behind me thank you
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for Testimony
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.049 --> 01:06:57.059 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
01:06:57.059 --> 01:07:16.809 align:start position:0%
oh representative
bye

01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:16.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you members
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
of the committee it's nice to see you
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
from this angle
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is
 
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
representative Chris muns I serve as one
 
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:29.339 align:start position:0%
of the four representatives from
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County District 29 which
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
includes Hampton
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking in opposition to HB 246 FN
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
I prepared a handout for you that is
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
going around the table right now but I'd
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
like to just give you a quick overview
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
of what it includes
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
according to the Department of energy
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
there is currently about 9.6 million
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
dollars in the renewable energy fund
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
about 1.8 million of that is already
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
earmarked for future expenses so that
 
01:07:59.089 --> 01:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
would leave about 7.8 million to be
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
available to offset rates if this bill
 
01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
available to offset rates if this bill
passed

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
the department of energy reports that we
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
currently consume about 10.7 billion
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours of electricity at that
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
level of consumption the 7.8 million in
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund would
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
translate into a one-time available rate
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
adjustment of
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
0.072 cents
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour or about 10.54 cents
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
per customer per year
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
for one year
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
furthermore assuming the fiscal notes
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
estimate that 4.6 million is added to
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund every year is
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
correct going forward if these are also
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
available to offset rates that would
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
result in an additional cost reduction
 
01:08:43.799 --> 01:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
result in an additional cost reduction
of

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
0.043 cents per kilowatt hour or six
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
dollars and 25 cents per customer per
 
01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:51.530 align:start position:0%
dollars and 25 cents per customer per
year

01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
so at most the benefit to customers
 
01:08:55.570 --> 01:08:55.580 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
16.70 79 cents in the first year and six
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
dollars and 25 cents per year thereafter
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
compare compare that to what we have
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
already been able to do with the
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund the department of
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
energy reports that between fiscal year
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
18 and fiscal year 22 a total of 20.1
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars of renewable energy
 
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
funds has been invested in over 4 000
 
01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:22.580 align:start position:0%
different projects which have created
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
177 million dollars of total economic
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
activity creating jobs General and
 
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
generating important and needed revenue
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
for our towns counties and the state
 
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
for our towns counties and the state
itself

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
most importantly those Investments have
 
01:09:38.209 --> 01:09:38.219 align:start position:0%
helped to diversify our energy sector
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
help to offset additional rate increases
 
01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:43.460 align:start position:0%
and better preparers for the future
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
additional opportunities for
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
diversification and economic growth will
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
be lost if HB 246 passes
 
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
all of that for a small investment of
 
01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:56.900 align:start position:0%
about six dollars and 25 cents per year
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
in our future by every electric consumer
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
finally since the FY since FY 18 the
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund has covered 2.6
 
01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:09.980 align:start position:0%
million in in Department of energy
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
administrative costs costs that would
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
have been would have to be funded from
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
the general fund if all proceeds from
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund are rebated
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
for all those reasons I urge you to vote
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
this bill is in expedient to legislate
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to try to answer any
 
01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I hope we
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
looked okay from your Vantage Point much
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
better from this angle
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
good to hear good to hear thank you
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
for you thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you know over
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days we've heard
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
people talking in the various hearings
 
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
here as well as we see it all over the
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
news uh basically all the time from the
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
the so-called inflation reduction act uh
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
why there's tens of billions of dollars
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
out there for renewable energy projects
 
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
literally we're throwing huge amounts of
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
money at these on the federal level uh I
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
question as to whether we even have the
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
resources to spend it all but wouldn't
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
it be prudent to turn around and say
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
since we're getting all these massive
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
subsidies from the federal government
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
through our tax dollars there that it
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
would be time to cut back on some of the
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
subsidies for renewable energy here
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
because we probably just can't spend it
 
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.729 align:start position:0%
because we probably just can't spend it
all

01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:11:28.739 --> 01:11:31.490 align:start position:0%
all
foreign

01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have any choice but
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out a way to spend it
 
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
all and
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
believe and trust in the people of New
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that they understand and
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
realize that we do need to diversify
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
everybody that I talked to when I was
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
campaigning for this position
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
um they they talked about you know the
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
high cost of energy
 
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
and you know that is something that we
 
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
need to address but the people of New
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
um very intelligent and they understand
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
that if you put all your eggs in one
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
basket such as we we have done with
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
um you are going to be at the mercy of
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
the market and we need to diversify
 
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up uh yeah in your
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
handout you talk about how uh all this
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh subsidies for renewable energy
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
created 177 million dollars of total
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
economic activity did you do a
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
calculation of how much economic
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
activity would be
 
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
um created if all the individual rate
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
payers got to save got to have their 16
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
dollars and 79 cents and there's six
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
dollars and 25 cents obviously we're
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
tracking thousands and thousands of
 
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
people with that money spending it as
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
they see fit rather than the government
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
does wouldn't that create at least as
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
much economic activity or do you believe
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I can really answer
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
that because that wasn't the question I
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
asked the department of energy I asked
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
the department of energy to tell me what
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
you know money has been invested and
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
what did what the benefit was I mean but
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
you would excuse me follow up
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
all right a quick one we're not here to
 
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
debate okay uh okay people who are
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
sitting at the testimony table
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative muns any
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
further questions I guess representative
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.130 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a question thank you Mr
chair

01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.189 align:start position:0%
chair
um

01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
the the rebate program is used wildly by
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities if it were removed and
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
they no longer got rebates would that
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
affect taxes
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
town taxes city taxes thank you
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
um again I I haven't done a detailed
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
deep dive and Analysis on that but that
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
would make sense that if you take money
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
away from a municipality that they have
 
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
to make that up somewhere and the way
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
they make it up is through increased
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative parcel has a question
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you chair of Olson thank you for
 
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
our former person that testified stated
 
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.189 align:start position:0%
our former person that testified stated
that

01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
Renewables are more expensive than
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and as she's not available
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
to ask this question I would like to ask
 
01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
you are you aware of any numbers that
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
saving rules are actually more expensive
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
than fossil fuels
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of any numbers and um
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
so yeah that I would I'd have to answer
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
it that way I mean my my understanding
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
is that as we invest more in renewable
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
energy production costs are coming down
 
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:41.420 align:start position:0%
um and everything that I have read
 
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
anecdotally suggests that for example
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
the cost of solar power is much cheaper
 
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
now than it's ever been and I also know
 
01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
from what I read that you know the price
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
of natural gas which we are almost
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
wholly dependent on has been going up
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
pretty dramatically and as a result of
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're so dependent on it
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
we are very much susceptible to the the
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
whims of the market
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi has a
 
01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.370 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi has a
question

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
yes directly to what representative
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
partial has
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
asked about do you recall the iso New
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
England presentation where they made the
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
statement that when you you uh build out
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
Renewables they are not reliable enough
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
therefore you need backup power
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
that is reliable whether it be nuclear
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
or or gas or whatever in order to ensure
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
that you can meet the demand
 
01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
that the customers have
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
hence cost of Renewables are more
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
well I I guess I guess I would argue
 
01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
that as as a as a demand for power
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
increases over the coming years
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
we should be able to rely on the
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
existing fossil fuel in uh generating
 
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we have to provide
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
that Baseline capacity if we invest you
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
know in if the new money we invest is in
 
01:16:11.219 --> 01:16:12.410 align:start position:0%
know in if the new money we invest is in
Renewables

01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
Renewables
 
01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
so I know okay let's let's not engage in
 
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
debate remember executive session is the
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
time to engage in debate just trying to
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
answer the question uh I think you did
 
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
answer the question so thank you
 
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
and remember we're not here to debate
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
we'll save that for executive session
 
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for a reminder
 
01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.050 align:start position:0%
thank you for a reminder
chair

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:35.060 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Muntz taking my
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
question sure we hear about
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
the money's being returned money should
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
be used for portfolio renewable
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
portfolio because
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's property
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
value of the customer do you see a way
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
to have an opt-in that the customer
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
receives their rebate and they can opt
 
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.850 align:start position:0%
receives their rebate and they can opt
in

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
to transfer that to the fund
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you no I I I don't and I and I
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
think someone
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned this
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
um last week or so
 
01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.370 align:start position:0%
um last week or so
um

01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
um you don't you don't opt in to Fire
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
Protection Services
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
um it's something that we as a community
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
decide is important to all of us and
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
um we all agree that we're going to fund
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
it and I would say that investing in our
 
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.370 align:start position:0%
it and I would say that investing in our
future

01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
um and and being able to provide you
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
know reliable energy to Future
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
Generations is something that we as a
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
community have decided that we're going
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
to do and we should need and we should
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question for you thank you
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
for providing this information from the
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
Department of energy a lot of
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
statistical information here
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I haven't a chance to had a chance
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
to review it thoroughly yet because I
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
just received it a few minutes ago but
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
since you probably have reviewed it
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
thoroughly can you tell me
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
if these numbers show that the projects
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
that are funded by the renewable energy
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
fund have reduced the cost of
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
electricity in New Hampshire
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
that was the one question I didn't want
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
reluctantly no it I I don't have that
 
01:18:30.659 --> 01:18:32.770 align:start position:0%
reluctantly no it I I don't have that
information

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:32.780 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
and I would like to get that information
 
01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
I I think your question is very valid
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
and it would be nice if we could if we
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
could have that information
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Reynolds
 
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:18:47.699 --> 01:18:49.010 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman um
but

01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
however along the lines of
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
Representative Bernardi's question and
 
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
you direct follow-up to Chairman voz's
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
question do you remember
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
the testimony the presentation we had
 
01:19:03.169 --> 01:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
from ISO New England which showed that
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
efficiency and distributed generation
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
distributed solar
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
throughout New England had resulted in a
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
very significant measurable
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
reduction in demand
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the regional
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
electric power pool and wouldn't
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
maintaining New Hampshire's
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and contributing
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
continuing to support distributed
 
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
generation in New Hampshire
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
reduce electric costs for all consumers
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer that question
 
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative munzett falls into the
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
category of debate we don't allow would
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
you believe or do you agree kind of
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
questions do you remember as that falls
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
into that category so one if I if I can
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
move on if I may just one file that was
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi's question so I
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
thought I could uh do the same
 
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
what one one I don't recall his question
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
being of that nature but one one just
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up to to your question
 
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:09.719 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos I mean I I do think it
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
would be one of the things if it doesn't
 
01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
already exist it would be very
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for all of us and everyone in
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
the state if there was a mechanism to
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
track you know what the impact is on of
 
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
of any any action that we're taking in
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
the energy field on on rates and and
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
there may that may exist and I just
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
haven't stumbled upon it yet but that
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
would be something very valuable I think
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
if you do stumble upon it please let us
 
01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.030 align:start position:0%
if you do stumble upon it please let us
know

01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:44.149 align:start position:0%
know
foreign

01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
and I will now call on our next
 
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.930 align:start position:0%
and I will now call on our next
presenter

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
presenter
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
and call to the table The Honorable Lee
 
01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:54.290 align:start position:0%
and call to the table The Honorable Lee
oxenham

01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
who will be testifying for herself
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
former member of this committee and a
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
good friend welcome
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't forget to turn on the mic
 
01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman Bose Lee
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
rather than provide the prepared
 
01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:23.060 align:start position:0%
testimony I would like to take the
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use my two minutes
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
possibly to better Advantage by
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
answering a couple of the questions that
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
have come up
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
the iso chart demonstrates that
 
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and Energy Efficiency
 
01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
have made great strides measurable
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
strides in reducing the total demand the
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
total load on the grid system and that
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
is in the millions of dollars of the
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund report it shows
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
these numbers the data is there
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
sixteen dollars per year or six dollars
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
per year as a rebate
 
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
is less than a dollar a month no one is
 
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
investing those funds no one is
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
assisting in the energy transformation
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
by having six dollars or sixteen dollars
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
or sixty or six hundred dollars these
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
are these are projects that take large
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
amounts of money
 
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.130 align:start position:0%
amounts of money
um

01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
assisting the clean energy transition
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
and assessing the value
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
positive value of renewable energy is
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
if I may quote
 
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.550 align:start position:0%
if I may quote
um

01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
from from my testimony RSA 362 F1 States
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
quoted is therefore in the public
 
01:22:45.649 --> 01:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
interest to stimulate investment in low
 
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
emission renewable energy generation
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
Technologies in New England and in
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
particular in New Hampshire
 
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
if I could just switch out of New
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a moment when they had the
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
terrible winter cold in Texas last year
 
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
the natural gas pipelines froze it was
 
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
demand response it was Energy Efficiency
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
and it was Renewables that kept as much
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
of the Electric System going as possible
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
the Christmas of this past year was a
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
terrible time in the South where they
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
had blackouts in pjm they had they were
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
on the verge of rolling blackouts but
 
01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
on the verge of rolling blackouts but
again

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
using the resources of Energy Efficiency
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and demand response
 
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
they were able to avoid that these are
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous values and finally I'll
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
simply say if we are taking the critical
 
01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
crisis of our time climate the climate
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
crisis if we take that into account we
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
must be putting the maximum amount of
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
investment into into managing what we
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
can mitigate today so that we do not
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
face a disaster in the future from being
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about six cents or 16 cents on
 
01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you you actually uh stayed below
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
two minutes I I was surprised well done
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
so do we have questions for
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative former representative
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
oxenham I have one
 
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
do you think that
 
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
in these inflationary times that we're
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
living in that
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
people who live paycheck to paycheck
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
deserve some relief
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
from their
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
from the high cost of electricity and
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
the high cost of heating their house do
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
you think people deserve any relief
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
I think people deserve relief on their
 
01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
housing I think they deserve relief on
 
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
their groceries I think we I think
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
people the low-income uh of end of the
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
latter deserve help from people who have
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
higher incomes and that's why I believe
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
in an income tax which I I don't believe
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
many um present here would would accept
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
and if I could I'm sorry that's not this
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
did you have to this bill but go ahead
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
um no the subject to this bill is the
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and if I could
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
just hearken back to a question that
 
01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
came up previously the issue of the
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
rebates this fig leaf that the rebates
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
are the way that people who profited by
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund rebate can pay
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
back into it the RPS requires
 
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
the Pavements from the electricity
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
suppliers not from people who got
 
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
rebates and in fact thousands of those
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
who received a rebate never
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I do better if I read it
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
thousands of those subject to the taking
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
never received any rebate and thousands
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
of those who did receive a rebate are
 
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
not subject to the taking so that are
 
01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
that argument comes up again and again
 
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
it came up three years ago when this
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
legislation passed the legislature and
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
was unfortunately vetoed by the governor
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
that uh this this this is this bill
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
wants to eliminate the renewable energy
 
01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:09.620 align:start position:0%
fund wants to eliminate
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
a very important source of investment
 
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
that is of Great Value to all New
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents no matter what their
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
income level is
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
making sure Volson it's good to see you
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
today nice to see you
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
we earlier the saw uh session we uh
 
01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:35.659 align:start position:0%
voted in a bipartisan way for house HCB
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
2023 I believe which uh which provided
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
rate payer relief directly through a
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
mechanism that was very well spelled out
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
do you believe that's in a more
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to provide rate payer
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
relief than something like this
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
I certainly do and thank you for the
 
01:26:51.719 --> 01:26:56.870 align:start position:0%
I certainly do and thank you for the
question

01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
former representative Lee oxenham all
 
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
right next up
 
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and Griffin
 
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
Roberge to testify on this bill Mr
 
01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:27.649 align:start position:0%
Roberge to testify on this bill Mr
robarsh

01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos members of the
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record new uh oh
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
Griffin Rober CNG program manager at the
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
um here to testify
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
um in a neutral position on House Bill
 
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:43.139 align:start position:0%
for uh 246.
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
um Department did want to note the
 
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
Bill's impacts uh should it become law
 
01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:48.709 align:start position:0%
Bill's impacts uh should it become law
um

01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll be discussing the RPS
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
quite a bit today and various pieces of
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
legislation so to back up RSA 362f which
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
was enacted in 2007
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
established the state's renewable
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard the RPS established
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
four different classes of renewable
 
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
energy resources like hydroelectric
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
biomass methane geothermal solar wind
 
01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.530 align:start position:0%
biomass methane geothermal solar wind
Etc

01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:14.540 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
under the RPS electric suppliers such as
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
eversource your default utility
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
suppliers or constellation a third-party
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
electric supplier must obtain renewable
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
energy credits for each of the four
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
classes under the erps as a set
 
01:28:34.129 --> 01:28:34.139 align:start position:0%
percentage of their retail electric load
 
01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is specified in the
 
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
handout that I provided earlier one Rec
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
represents the renewable energy
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
attributes of one megawatt hour of
 
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
electricity from that source
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
if electric suppliers cannot purchase
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
the necessary amount of wrecks needed to
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
satisfy their obligations under the the
 
01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
four classes electric suppliers must
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
make alternative compliance payments
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
these payments are made directly to the
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
department and are deposited into a
 
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund under State Statute
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
called the renewable energy fund the
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is used to offer
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
rebates and competitive grants to
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
advance the deployment of renewable
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
energy projects that can create wrecks
 
01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
to help electric suppliers satisfy their
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
RPS obligations the ideas be the idea
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
behind the RPS is that acps are
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
collected into the ref they're then used
 
01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
to encourage the development of Rec
 
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
eligible renewable energy projects that
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
can produce as I said needed Rex to be
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
bought and used by electric suppliers to
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
meet their RPS obligations much of this
 
01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
is in that diagram on page six of that
 
01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:44.060 align:start position:0%
handout that flow chart
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
which kind of maps out how the RPS works
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh turning to the actual uh bill the
 
01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
bill really impacts if you look at the
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
flow chart the green bubble labeled the
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and largely the
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
bubble next to it that's labeled uh new
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
certified facility so that bottom tier
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the flow chart so under section one
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
the ref is not repealed but repurposed
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't alter State expenditures from
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
the fund but how the fund uh expends
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
dollars in that fund So in theory under
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
under this new paradigm that the bill
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
presents is that acps will still be
 
01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
collected from electric suppliers they
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
will then be deposited into the
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund however as is
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
proposed as is outlined in the flow
 
01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:32.770 align:start position:0%
proposed as is outlined in the flow
chart

01:30:32.770 --> 01:30:32.780 align:start position:0%
chart
 
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
the ability to draw admin costs offer
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
rebate and Grant programs for residents
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
and commercial industrial uh users is no
 
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
longer in existence those programs are
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
repealed under this bill and all of the
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
dollars that flow into the RAF for now
 
01:30:52.010 --> 01:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
rebated back to Electric customers via
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
puc likely a puc adjudicated process to
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
bring forward a reduction in electric
 
01:30:57.719 --> 01:30:59.149 align:start position:0%
bring forward a reduction in electric
rates

01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:30:59.159 --> 01:30:59.689 align:start position:0%
rates
um

01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
I think what the department wants to
 
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
note is that in the bill as it is
 
01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
currently drafted and I haven't seen the
 
01:31:07.570 --> 01:31:07.580 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative naughter
 
01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:10.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned that she was proposing but
 
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
language in the bill removes the ability
 
01:31:14.209 --> 01:31:14.219 align:start position:0%
from the Department for the Department
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
to draw administrative expenses from the
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund these
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses run the gamut so
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
it includes managing the various rebate
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
and Grant programs working on our PS
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
related dockets administrative rule
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
changes monitoring and valid and
 
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
validating facility and supplier
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
compliance with the RPS potential
 
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
program revisions and without the ref
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
funding uh to be quite Frank doe would
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
be unable to implement or continue to
 
01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
maintain the state's RPS policy as it's
 
01:31:44.689 --> 01:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
been imposed by the New Hampshire
 
01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:45.980 align:start position:0%
General Court
 
01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
absent a dedicated funding source doe
 
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
would not have the financial means to
 
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
maintain its current administrative
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
resources for the RPS for the
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future and would likely need
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
an alternative dedicated funding source
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
to do do that that's section one section
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
two of the bill repeals the stat the
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
various statutory Provisions
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
establishing the Grant and rebate
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
programs that the ref uses dollars to
 
01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.010 align:start position:0%
programs that the ref uses dollars to
fund

01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
um beyond the repeat just the simple
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
repeal of those programs section two
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
would likely impact pending rebate and
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
Grant applications before uh the
 
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
department it would likely affect
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
ongoing our our requests for proposals
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
or rfps for refunded programs and
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
current Grant award contracts that have
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
been approved uh by governor and Council
 
01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:36.980 align:start position:0%
for current awardees to these programs
 
01:32:40.129 --> 01:32:40.139 align:start position:0%
by way of context the department manages
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
four different rebate programs there is
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
one for residential solar one for
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
residential wood pellet systems and then
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
two for commercial industrial users for
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
Solar Technologies rebate and a wood
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
pellet furnace or boiler rebate
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
and then the the other two Grant
 
01:32:59.689 --> 01:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
programs include the non-residential
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
competitive grant program and the LMI
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
Community solar grant program
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
um the non-residential competitive grant
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
program has been utilized largely by
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial customers such
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
as municipalities or large businesses
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
for larger Renewable Energy Products
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
that can projects that can produce
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
wrecks that can then be used by electric
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
suppliers and then obviously as I'm sure
 
01:33:26.689 --> 01:33:26.699 align:start position:0%
this committee is is aware of the LMI
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
Community solar grant program is used to
 
01:33:30.129 --> 01:33:30.139 align:start position:0%
provide grants for
 
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects that would
 
01:33:36.169 --> 01:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
directly provide a benefit to low to
 
01:33:39.129 --> 01:33:39.139 align:start position:0%
moderate income households on their bill
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
and then further information I guess on
 
01:33:43.610 --> 01:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
the bill can be found in our in the
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
Department's fiscal note but beyond that
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
um if you happen to take any questions
 
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
that the committee might have
 
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
that valuable information so if I
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
you are saying that
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill the repeal of
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
362 F colon 10 5 through 11 is the
 
01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
problematic section of the bill and if
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
that was removed from the bill
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
you would see that there would be fewer
 
01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill is that my
 
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you for the question
 
01:34:23.689 --> 01:34:23.699 align:start position:0%
I think uh obviously it's a politics
 
01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
policy decision for legislators to make
 
01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:29.420 align:start position:0%
as to how the fund is uh functions
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
obviously we just follow what's
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
prescribed in State Statute I think
 
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
I think the more concerning aspect of
 
01:34:38.689 --> 01:34:38.699 align:start position:0%
the bill is the removal of the ability
 
01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:41.219 align:start position:0%
of the department to drag admit to draw
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses from the fund
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
without that
 
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
um the RPS currently in statute
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
um kind of caps out at 2025 so there's
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
still two years here of potential
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
increased obligations across the classes
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's processes that need to take
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
place to make sure that systems are
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
certified certified to create wrecks
 
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
without the ability to pay for staff to
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
do that the RPS is more or less just in
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
statute without any
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
State staff or agencies kind of managing
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
it or overseeing it it's just acting on
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
its own
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you for that
 
01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:18.500 align:start position:0%
clarification representative
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question thank you Mr
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Roberts for
 
01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
taking my question you've just listed
 
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
several problems that would arise if
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass yet you state
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
that Doe is neutral on it so what are
 
01:35:37.450 --> 01:35:37.460 align:start position:0%
the advantages that could possibly
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
counterbalance all these disadvantages
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
well I thank you for the question
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative um as has been mentioned
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
there this is a time of historic um
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
electric rates and that type of thing
 
01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:52.139 align:start position:0%
um you know whether or not let uh
 
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
policymakers such as yourself determine
 
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
that this is the best way to provide
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
um a policy mechanism to provide a rate
 
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:01.139 align:start position:0%
relief to Electric customers that
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
something for folks to consider as a
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
department of energy as a legislative
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
legislature created us it's to provide a
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
unified Direction on state energy
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
policies and obviously provide the
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislators feedback on you know the
 
01:36:15.490 --> 01:36:15.500 align:start position:0%
implications or benefits of any type of
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
policy decision they make that's at
 
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
least the indicate that's at least the
 
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay seeing no further
 
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
questions we'd like to thank you for
 
01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:30.590 align:start position:0%
questions we'd like to thank you for
your

01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
testimony and participation and now I'd
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
like to call forward uh Mr Greg Moore
 
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
representing Americans for Prosperity to
 
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
give us his take on this bill
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Moore
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
always great to be before this committee
 
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
I'm here today uh in support of House
 
01:36:59.530 --> 01:36:59.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 246 representative NATA reached out
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh I think part of it because in 2012
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
when I was working as a chief of staff
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the house I did a lot of work on the
 
01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:10.460 align:start position:0%
bill that rebated the Reggie
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
back then and she of course was still on
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
this committee at the time so uh this is
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
a very similar mechanism presumably if
 
01:37:20.649 --> 01:37:20.659 align:start position:0%
the legislature wishes to move forward
 
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:22.860 align:start position:0%
obviously we're dealing the time that
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
has historic rate increases for
 
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
electricity just to quantify that for
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
for the committee I got an email from
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
one of my former electricity suppliers
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
it said new low rate and I opened it up
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it said 1677 a kilowatt which kind
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
of struck me because a little over a
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago I had re-upped knock
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
on wood with a three-year plan at eight
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
and a half cents a kilowatt but that
 
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
should indicate just the type of
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
escalation we've seen in electricity
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
prices just over the Arc of the last
 
01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:51.830 align:start position:0%
prices just over the Arc of the last
year

01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh how do we get relief to the
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
ratepayers I know that there are a
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
number of ways a number of mechanisms uh
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
one of them that the governor proposed
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
last year which was to use Surplus
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
revenues to do 100 it was 150 dollar
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
credits uh via the utilities I know the
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
legislature decided to go in a different
 
01:38:10.199 --> 01:38:11.270 align:start position:0%
legislature decided to go in a different
direction

01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
decided to uh to go with expanding
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility for LIHEAP so they so it was
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
a different direction as far as
 
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
providing energy rate relief but steps
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
like these are important at a time when
 
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
we're seeing just doubling of
 
01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
electricity costs and take taking the
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to move forward with this is
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
is critical now finding the long-term
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
solutions to
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
resolve a number of the issues that are
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
facing facing us as far as finding
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
affordable long-term Energy Solutions
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
everybody has their own opinions whether
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's increasing natural gas pipeline
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
capacity whether it's expanding nuclear
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
which would be my choice but uh or the
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
government is back to large-scale hydro
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
or even waiting for technological
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
advances for existing Renewables to
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
improve to improve overall overall
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
affordability we need to take steps at
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
least in the short term and I and I I'm
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
encouraged that representative said you
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
know let's let's do this for a two-year
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
cycle I think that's appropriate
 
01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
considering the rate relief I mean we
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
don't know how long the situation in
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
Europe is going to continue
 
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
so we think it's uh practical to take
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
steps like this following procedures
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
like we did back in 2012 and continuing
 
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
on efforts to try to try to advance some
 
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
rate payer relief at this this I think
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
a difficult time for a lot of low low
 
01:39:36.110 --> 01:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
income people and there are other
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
mechanisms certainly but I think this is
 
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
one and it's worth exploring and that's
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
why we support this legislation so I'd
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate you being here
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'll ask you a quick question to start
 
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.070 align:start position:0%
I'll ask you a quick question to start
off

01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
the mechanism proposed here would
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
probably take six eight months to get in
 
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
place do you think that provides relief
 
01:39:59.689 --> 01:39:59.699 align:start position:0%
quickly enough to help
 
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
folks out there who are
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
trying to make it in a tough economy
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
well I don't expect that we see
 
01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
electricity rates go down over the next
 
01:40:10.729 --> 01:40:10.739 align:start position:0%
six to eight months I suspect that
 
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
that's yeah there's probably going to
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
see a leveling of those costs so whether
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
they get that relief now or in six
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
months I think they'll it'll still be
 
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
just as needed I think we saw it a
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
little bit faster than that in 2012 when
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
we when we did the uh and I understand
 
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
how the dockets move into puc it doesn't
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
happen overnight nothing happens
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
overnight particularly with energy
 
01:40:32.689 --> 01:40:32.699 align:start position:0%
nothing happens overnight but uh but to
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
your point I don't see it uh any
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
near-term reductions in electricity
 
01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
costs I don't think any of the any of
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
the changes we've seen uh will have made
 
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
much much of an impact in six or eight
 
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
months so I think that
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
rate relief in six to eight months would
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
be just as valuable as rate relief in
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
two months
 
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
questions for uh representative Corman
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
has a question for you thank you Mr
 
01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
question a representative Munns
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
testified that the reduction per year
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
would be about six dollars and 25 cents
 
01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:11.699 align:start position:0%
per customer do you really see make that
 
01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
making a big difference I think for some
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
people yes representative I I think that
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
for some people who are maybe living on
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
the edge six dollars a year might make a
 
01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:22.820 align:start position:0%
difference but I I think it's probably
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh up to them to make that decision
 
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.050 align:start position:0%
uh up to them to make that decision
foreign

01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question thank you Mr
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
question getting back to that figure the
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
question I had asked earlier about the
 
01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
um that was in this handouts is that was
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
created 177 million dollars worth of
 
01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
total economic activity now under this
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill rather than going to that it would
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
be returned to the rate payers could you
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
comment on what you think the rate pays
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
would do with this extra money
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
I think every rate payer would make
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
their own decision of what to do with it
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh as far as economic activity I I've
 
01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
been around a long time in 20 years in
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
and around State politics and I got to
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
tell you there have been so many studies
 
01:42:10.490 --> 01:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
that have promised some so much economic
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
activity and and what you find is you
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
really drill into it is that there are a
 
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
lot of assumptions that are making made
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
in each and every one of those studies
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh and none of them consider the
 
01:42:21.179 --> 01:42:22.189 align:start position:0%
uh and none of them consider the
alternatives

01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
and uh to your point it's a valuable
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
point from an economic perspective if
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
the money is not spent here would would
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
probably be spent somewhere else and
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
that would create other economic
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
activity so it's hard to quantify what
 
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
um in order to qualify for a rebate you
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
must demonstrate that the measure you're
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
putting forward saves
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
um it it it is energy efficient
 
01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:54.350 align:start position:0%
um it it it is energy efficient
um

01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
so some some commercial
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
um clients
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
choose to put in an energy efficient
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
system even though it's a little more
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
expensive now they want to save money
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
um and that's then they get a rebate for
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
doing that if we removed these rebates
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
would these commercial clients still be
 
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
inclined to install energy efficient
 
01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.070 align:start position:0%
inclined to install energy efficient
equipment

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:43:24.169 --> 01:43:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no question that that
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh Capital Improvements were happening
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
before the renewable energy fund existed
 
01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
so when people thought that there was a
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
long-term benefit by by making a capital
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
investment up front they would do it
 
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:39.659 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon
 
01:43:39.659 --> 01:43:40.370 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon
um

01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
is the incremental incentive enough to
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
make people make a major capital
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
investment I think that's an impossible
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
question to answer I I it's on a
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have three more people who want to
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
testify so let's move on quickly thank
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh just a very quick
 
01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.169 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh just a very quick
question

01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
um we've been talking this morning about
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers and how much they would
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
only you know 16 or six dollars per year
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
depending on which year
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
um and that it wouldn't go in effect for
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
six months but according to bill here it
 
01:44:14.689 --> 01:44:14.699 align:start position:0%
does say that counties and
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
municipalities would recognize the
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
savings on this too is that correct
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I didn't I'm sorry I
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
didn't do the fiscal note so I really
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
couldn't speak to it okay thank you
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
there was a time when I did fiscal notes
 
01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:34.139 align:start position:0%
okay see no further questions we want to
 
01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
and call forward
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%

01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
the committee um for the record my name
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
is Heidi Kroll I work at Gallagher

01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
distributed generation and with me today
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
is Madeleine minnow who works for Essex
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
Hydro is a member of the Granite State
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
hydropower Association and her role at
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
essex's Chief Operating Officer we are
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill and I'll turn it
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
over to Madeline to explain our position
 
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
and then happy to answer any questions
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
um as Heidi stated gsha opposes this
 
01:45:50.699 --> 01:45:51.590 align:start position:0%
um as Heidi stated gsha opposes this
bill

01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:45:52.850 --> 01:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
um though we certainly support rate
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
relief for New Hampshire Electric rate
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
payers we do not think that this would
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
provide meaningful relief for those rate
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
payers and it may actually end up
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
increasing certain costs
 
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
as you've heard already
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
um the way that the renewable portfolio
 
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
standard and the ref works is that all
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers have a compliance
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
obligation and they can either meet that
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
compliance obligation by purchasing
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates or making
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments the
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments is what
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
funds the renewable energy fund
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
purchasing renewable energy certificates
 
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
is a significantly lower cost and more
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
efficient way of meeting compliance
 
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
obligations because the ACP is a ceiling
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
price therefore Rex can always be
 
01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:38.629 align:start position:0%
price therefore Rex can always be
purchased

01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
typically for significantly less than
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
the equivalent ACP in a given compliance
 
01:46:44.699 --> 01:46:47.330 align:start position:0%
the equivalent ACP in a given compliance

01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
um every dollar that goes into the are
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
the ref then is spent on rebate and
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
Grant programs every dollar that is
 
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
spent from The Ref the intent is to
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
increase the supply of racks
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
with increasing supply of wrecks the
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
cost the value of Rex goes down and
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
therefore the cost of compliance for
 
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers goes down as you
 
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
heard the compliance cost is passed on
 
01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:16.139 align:start position:0%
to ratepayers and so as we
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
have granted rebate programs that are
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
spent with the intent of increasing
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
supply of racks the compliance cost of
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
the RPS for rate payers should go down
 
01:47:29.689 --> 01:47:29.699 align:start position:0%
we also Grant State hydropower
 
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
Association members have competed for
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
those competitive Grant programs and
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
have sometimes been successful this has
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
resulted in refurbished turbines that
 
01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
were not no longer operational being put
 
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
back online and generating renewable
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
energy as well as new incremental
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
generation at existing projects that
 
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
also generate new bricks and renewable
 
01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:50.510 align:start position:0%
also generate new bricks and renewable
energy

01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
we also ran some numbers our numbers are
 
01:47:54.169 --> 01:47:54.179 align:start position:0%
slightly different than representative
 
01:47:57.530 --> 01:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
muns but I will share them with you so
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
ACB payments are variable year to year
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
in the last five years that's about
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
varied from a low of two and a half
 
01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
million in 2019 to a high of 7.19
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
Million last year in 2021.
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
if that is rebated to rate pairs that
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
would be equivalent last year the high
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
amount in the last five years would be
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
0.068 cents per kilowatt hour
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
and so an average residential rate pair
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
that uses 600 kilowatt hours
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
would see a reduction of 41 cents on
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
their monthly bill so to put that into
 
01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
context I live in Unitil territory if I
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
had used 600 kilowatt hours last month
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
in January my bill would be 218 dollars
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
and 20 cents if this bill were enacted
 
01:48:46.810 --> 01:48:46.820 align:start position:0%
my bill would have instead bid
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
217.79 I can guarantee you that that
 
01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
rate reduction would not be very
 
01:48:56.810 --> 01:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um as was already mentioned
 
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
um for the competitive grant program the
 
01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:03.659 align:start position:0%
scoring is very much weighted to
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
encourage private investment
 
01:49:09.169 --> 01:49:09.179 align:start position:0%
the dollars spent are typically matched
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh with 4.6 dollars on average of
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
private investment
 
01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
as someone who runs a renewable energy
 
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
business I can tell you that grants that
 
01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
will lower our return on investment when
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking at making a big investment
 
01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
can make the difference between us
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
deciding to do a project or not do a
 
01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:30.770 align:start position:0%
deciding to do a project or not do a
project

01:49:30.770 --> 01:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take any questions okay
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
you guys asked for five minutes and you
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
have hit the four minute and 15 second
 
01:49:41.209 --> 01:49:41.219 align:start position:0%
Mark so well done okay any questions for
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
Granite State hydropower representative
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question thank you Mr
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
question so as I understand it you said
 
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:51.109 align:start position:0%
question so as I understand it you said
that

01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:51.119 --> 01:49:52.370 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
with the renewable energy fund that
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
actually helps create more renewable
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
energy which creates more wrecks and
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
therefore the supply of wrecks increases
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
therefore the price of Rex decreases
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
now you are representing people who
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
actually produce renewable energy so I'm
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
just curious why is it in your interest
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
for the price of wrecks to decrease so I
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you that when we model out
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
Investments we know that
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is going to continue to
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
develop so I can tell you that in our
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
financial models we assume a decreasing
 
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
value of Rex we know that this is going
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
to happen and so we factor that in we're
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
not trying to fight against that we
 
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:38.900 align:start position:0%
don't want to you know
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
poured wreck so that they are worth more
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
we we know that this is how the
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard in every
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
New England state was designed is to
 
01:50:52.990 --> 01:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
increase goals but at the same time have
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to increase the development
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy and to increase the
 
01:50:59.930 --> 01:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
supply of racks with the goal that over
 
01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.609 align:start position:0%
supply of racks with the goal that over
time

01:51:01.609 --> 01:51:01.619 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
the supply will increase and so it's not
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
something we're trying to fight but I
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
can tell you that the grant programs
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
funded by The Ref are very beneficial to
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
to gsha members as I'm saying when we're
 
01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:16.139 align:start position:0%
looking at making significant
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
Investments which may increase the
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
generation at some of our projects
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
having a grant like that is important to
 
01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:27.169 align:start position:0%
having a grant like that is important to
us

01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here and now we'll
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
call forward Meredith Hatfield
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
good uh morning
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
um chairman votes members of the
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
committee Meredith Hatfield for The
 
01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:50.780 align:start position:0%
Nature Conservancy
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill because we think
 
01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:56.219 align:start position:0%
that both the RPS and the renewable
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
energy fund are important pieces of a
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
diversified portfolio approach to
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
meeting New Hampshire's energy needs and
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
I'm reminded of the discussions that you
 
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
had during your orientation about the
 
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
challenges with default service
 
01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:16.139 align:start position:0%
um both the volatility and the price but
 
01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
also the challenges with procuring it
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
and we think that investing in renewable
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
energy is an important part of
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
insulating our state from volatility
 
01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
while also growing our clean energy
 
01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:29.629 align:start position:0%
while also growing our clean energy
economy

01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:52:32.209 --> 01:52:32.219 align:start position:0%
people definitely need and deserve rate
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
relief and I think the state has already
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
taken significant steps to build on our
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
already very effective programs that are
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
administered through our community
 
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
action agencies but this bill you know
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
seems um
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
to not really make a dent in people's
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
energy bills and I would really
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to think much
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
more about bills than rates and to think
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
about renewable programs as a way to
 
01:53:02.689 --> 01:53:02.699 align:start position:0%
help us all reduce our bills I I wanted
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
to point you to the renewable energy
 
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
fund report that was issued by the
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
department of energy it's dated October
 
01:53:11.590 --> 01:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
1st 2022
 
01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
on page 30
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
the department says as this report
 
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
illustrates demand for rebates and Grant
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
Awards continues to be strong and
 
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
they're I believe they're referring to
 
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund rebate and
 
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
Grant funds have leveraged over 381
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars in private investment
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
boosting providing a boost to the
 
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
state's economy and creating jobs for
 
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
electricians plumbers and Alternative
 
01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
Energy businesses
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
in addition there has been substantial
 
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
growth in distributed generation
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy systems that serve to
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
diversify our energy Supply reduce our
 
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
Reliance on fossil fuels reduce
 
01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:49.860 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions and increase
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
our energy Independence
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to make sure that you've
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
reviewed the fiscal note on the bill
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's been discussed by a few prior
 
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
speakers including the representative of
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
the department but the fiscal note does
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
indicate that County and local
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
governments would see their revenues
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
decline as grants from the renewable
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
energy fund would no longer be available
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
and I think anyone who pays property
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
taxes in the state understands that
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
state and local governments excuse me
 
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
local and County governments can can use
 
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
all the help that they can in reducing
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
things like their energy bills and
 
01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
lastly I
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
would like to just amplify the comments
 
01:54:34.129 --> 01:54:34.139 align:start position:0%
of the Department's representative about
 
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
the fact that they would no longer have
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
funds to administer the law which
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
includes oversight of compliance which
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
we believe is an important function of
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
well done
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
two minutes and 30 seconds you asked for
 
01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
three so
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're right on any questions for Ms
 
01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:56.330 align:start position:0%
you're right on any questions for Ms
Hatfield

01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
Hatfield
 
01:54:58.609 --> 01:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
see none I thank you thank you and I
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
called the final person to speak on this
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
bill Sam Evans Brown from clean energy
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:10.149 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
ERS yesterday welcome back thank you uh
 
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'll be I'll be brief many of the points
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
that I was going to make have been made
 
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
already particularly I think when it
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
comes to the cost of renewable portfolio
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
standard compliance uh I think that
 
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
would be an unintended consequence of
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh and but I I'd also just like to uh
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
say again that there are precious few
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
policies in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
that are encouraging fuel diversity at
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
this point and the renewable portfolio
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
standard and the renewable energy fund
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
is uh I would I would argue the the most
 
01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
powerful uh policy that we have in place
 
01:55:48.590 --> 01:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
that is in fact encouraging fuel
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
diversity and uh the the market
 
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
structures that we have in New England
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
at this point have done an excellent job
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
at ensuring
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh Merit order dispatch of existing
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
power plants which is to say it's done
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of ensuring that the
 
01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
power plants that we have already are uh
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
the cheapest ones are running first they
 
01:56:10.609 --> 01:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
have not necessarily done an excellent
 
01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
job of encouraging a diverse portfolio
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
of generation assets that can act as a
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
hedge against volatile fuel prices and
 
01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
so while uh the the prospect of rate
 
01:56:24.890 --> 01:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
relief I'm sure is in is an uh
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
attractive one it's one that comes with
 
01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
Peril down the road if there is not
 
01:56:31.609 --> 01:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
investment in different sources of fuel
 
01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
and if we over invest on a single source
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
of fuel so I would urge the the
 
01:56:38.330 --> 01:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
committee to find this bill in expedient
 
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
um as just a a small note if if we are
 
01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179 align:start position:0%
looking at thinking of ways for the
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund to perhaps be
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
better leveraged uh there there's there
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
are plenty of opportunities I would
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
argue to investigate the ways in which
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
the rebates and grants are being
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
dispersed and trying to Target those
 
01:56:59.689 --> 01:56:59.699 align:start position:0%
rebates and grants at projects that
 
01:57:01.850 --> 01:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
truly would not happen if it were not
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
for those grants such as investments in
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
in new turbines and in you know Hydro
 
01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
facilities that have a lot of a lot of
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
upfront Capital costs um that's a
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
perfect example of the program working
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
well and and perhaps a path forward
 
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
would be to suggest that this bill look
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
at the at the the structure of of how
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
the removable energy fund is spent and
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that most of those Investments
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
are in fact additional as opposed to
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to projects that may may be able
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
to advance on their own merits
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
great thank you questions for
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%

spoken here this morning who would like
 
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
to speak to the committee on this uh on
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none

02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
in the last session the group host
 
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
language was modified to include
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal group hosts under the statute
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 362 A9
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
section 14a however language remained
 
02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
that kept
 
02:04:50.099 --> 02:04:52.550 align:start position:0%
that kept
uh

02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
an exclusion for anyone who already
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
generates any of their own
 
02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
generates any of their own
energy

02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
that is uh exemption I am told by
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who will likely be
 
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
attending the hearing today was intended
 
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
from receiving a double benefit
 
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
the most likely members in a group
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
hosting Arrangement are individuals and
 
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
businesses who are interested in
 
02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
offsetting their utility costs by
 
02:05:29.209 --> 02:05:29.219 align:start position:0%
investing in
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
local sustainable energy resources in
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
some cases those looking to join a group
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
hosting Arrangement already have
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
for example solar rooftop panels but
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
they would like to further offset their
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
energy needs
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
and and I believe they should have the
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
right to take part in group posting
 
02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:50.270 align:start position:0%
right to take part in group posting
um

02:05:50.270 --> 02:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
for net uh
 
02:05:55.129 --> 02:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
net sorry I've got something going on
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
they should have the right to take part
 
02:06:00.169 --> 02:06:00.179 align:start position:0%
in uh group hosting
 
02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
as both a customer generator and a
 
02:06:04.129 --> 02:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
member of another group hosting
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
arrangement the concern for the issue of
 
02:06:09.250 --> 02:06:09.260 align:start position:0%
double dipping no longer exists because
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
utilities have
 
02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:13.370 align:start position:0%
utilities have
um

02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
implemented the ability to accurately
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
track net metering credits on customer
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
bills so the original concern is gone so
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:06:25.729 --> 02:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
exemption should also be gone
 
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
I've also been given examples of
 
02:06:29.450 --> 02:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
businesses who are currently offsetting
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
their utility bills by say 10 percent
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
with previous rooftop solar
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
installations but who are prohibited
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
under this exemption from joining a
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
local group host to purchase additional
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
clean energy to offset the other 90
 
02:06:45.169 --> 02:06:45.179 align:start position:0%
percent of their needs in many cases
 
02:06:47.089 --> 02:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
businesses advertise their
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly practices as
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
part of their branding to customers so
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
not allowing those people who are most
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
likely to participate in group hosting
 
02:07:00.169 --> 02:07:00.179 align:start position:0%
to pursue group hosting deals has the
 
02:07:01.970 --> 02:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
effect of holding back the free market
 
02:07:04.970 --> 02:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
it has placed an unnecessary roadblock
 
02:07:06.890 --> 02:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
02:07:09.050 --> 02:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
we want New Hampshire rate payers to
 
02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
participate in locally generated energy
 
02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
in order to help them lower their bills
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
competition brings prices down and
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
reinforces New Hampshire's economy I'll
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
close by stating that the point of group
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
hosting is to give people options
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
to promote competition and to encourage
 
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
local control
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's important that we learn from our
 
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
own research such as
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
or our own research that the
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
long-standing fear of potential cost
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
shifting was not supported by the
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
long-awaited value of distributed Energy
 
02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:43.089 align:start position:0%
long-awaited value of distributed Energy
report

02:07:43.089 --> 02:07:43.099 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
that incidental cost shifting of perhaps
 
02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
one percent which was confirmed in the
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
vder report pales in comparison to the
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
over 100 percent
 
02:07:57.050 --> 02:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
electric rate hike that consumers have
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
suffered in this market
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about where
 
02:08:03.290 --> 02:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
competition's been stifled by this
 
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
exemption we can start by removing the
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
group posting exemption that says you
 
02:08:10.129 --> 02:08:10.139 align:start position:0%
can only participate if you do not
 
02:08:12.530 --> 02:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
already have any self-cited generation
 
02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
helping to lower your bills that's an
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
artificial constraint and it doesn't
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
help customers lower their bills so if
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
we can agree that we want to do
 
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
everything we can to help Granite
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
Staters lower their electric bills
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for introducing this
 
02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:33.890 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for introducing this
legislation

02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
now let's find out if the members of the
 
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
committee have any questions about it
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative barashni has a question
 
02:08:43.070 --> 02:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
um looking at this RSA later down on
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
line eight it has um the host shell and
 
02:08:53.810 --> 02:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
then if you continue on to line nine uh
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
in the middle there shell certified that
 
02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
all members of the group
 
02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
and then continue to line 11 that the
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
total historic annual load of the group
 
02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
members together with the host exceeds
 
02:09:07.370 --> 02:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
the projected annual output of the host
 
02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:08.510 align:start position:0%
the projected annual output of the host
facility

02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is if you remove this
 
02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
part that says
 
02:09:14.810 --> 02:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
that other customers can't be customer
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
generators how can the host certify that
 
02:09:21.530 --> 02:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
the the total load is not going to be is
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a certain amount
 
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
so I don't have that language in front
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
of me but what I do know about the
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
entire group hosting a group net
 
02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
metering and group hosting Arrangements
 
02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
is that the idea
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:37.310 align:start position:0%
is that
um

02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:39.649 --> 02:09:39.659 align:start position:0%
the energy consumption
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
Off the Grid of the group
 
02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
must exceed that
 
02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
of the customer cited generation
 
02:09:52.669 --> 02:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
and so the annual projected production
 
02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
of a solar facility is a very
 
02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:56.030 align:start position:0%
of a solar facility is a very
predictable

02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing and the energy consumption of the
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
group members is obtained from you know
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
their historical consumption their bills
 
02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the way this group net
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
metering deal Works uh it was this bill
 
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
addresses the fact that it was
 
02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:19.129 align:start position:0%
addresses the fact that it was
previously

02:10:19.129 --> 02:10:19.139 align:start position:0%
previously
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh impossible for someone who was
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
already hosting some solar say of Their
 
02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:28.010 align:start position:0%
already hosting some solar say of Their
Own

02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
but that solar may have only met like 10
 
02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
of their building load
 
02:10:34.609 --> 02:10:34.619 align:start position:0%
they were prevented from participating
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
in a in a group net meeting or
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
Arrangement where they could be
 
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
sort of virtually getting renewable
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
energy from another place
 
02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
so now the utilities have the ability to
 
02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:49.070 align:start position:0%
so now the utilities have the ability to
um

02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
you know accurately meter and read it so
 
02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
we don't need to have that exclusion in
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
I guess follow follow up yep so
 
02:11:04.609 --> 02:11:04.619 align:start position:0%
this requires it look further down this
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
requires the host to certify that the
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
total load is going to be a certain
 
02:11:10.129 --> 02:11:10.139 align:start position:0%
amount if the host doesn't have control
 
02:11:12.169 --> 02:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
over what
 
02:11:12.179 --> 02:11:13.189 align:start position:0%
over what
um

02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
renewable energy some of the customers
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
may or may not have
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if they can generate their
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
electricity then that changes the total
 
02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
load and I don't know how the the the
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
um the host can certify that
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm another aspect of the group
 
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
net metering regime is that group hosts
 
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
must file a report annually with the puc
 
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
so all the participants are required to
 
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
keep track and certify annually that
 
02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
they're um
 
02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
that their consumption and the
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
production are are in compliance you
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
so if I'm a customer generator
 
02:12:09.649 --> 02:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
and I'm net metering myself
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
and then I get invited by you
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
to join your group
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
and you're the host of that group and
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
you're net metering
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
why is that not double dipping on that
 
02:12:20.639 --> 02:12:23.270 align:start position:0%
why is that not double dipping on that
metering

02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
or how is that not double dipping on
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
that metering
 
02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:31.820 align:start position:0%
well because net metering is is just a
 
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh mechanism
 
02:12:38.209 --> 02:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
you know well-established used
 
02:12:40.209 --> 02:12:40.219 align:start position:0%
all over the country
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
by which
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
any any excess generation at certain
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
times of day
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh that that customer cited generation
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
May produce goes to the grid
 
02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:56.030 align:start position:0%
May produce goes to the grid
and

02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
the customer who owns that generation is
 
02:13:03.649 --> 02:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.659 --> 02:13:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know excess generation
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
happens during only certain certain
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
times certain days it doesn't happen on
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
cloudy days doesn't happen at night
 
02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
happens during the you know bright
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
bright sunny so
 
02:13:22.609 --> 02:13:22.619 align:start position:0%
all of the group all of the net metering
 
02:13:24.649 --> 02:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
and the group net metering is just
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
designed to
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
give proper compensation to those who
 
02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
have invested their own money in in
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
generating electricity and putting it on
 
02:13:38.209 --> 02:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
the grid at Peak at their peak time of
 
02:13:41.089 --> 02:13:41.099 align:start position:0%
production where it goes over the over
 
02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
the grid to their neighbor and the
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
utility sells it
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
next door so
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
again the group net metering rules where
 
02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:52.619 align:start position:0%
which I described earlier
 
02:13:55.370 --> 02:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
are designed to
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
not allow
 
02:14:01.609 --> 02:14:01.619 align:start position:0%
the excess generation you know to sort
 
02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
of to get out of hand to be more than
 
02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:05.250 align:start position:0%
of to get out of hand to be more than
the

02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:05.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:05.870 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.189 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
the all the members in the group use
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
the best I can
 
02:14:23.569 --> 02:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.209 --> 02:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
adding language to this legislation that
 
02:14:34.129 --> 02:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
would specify that a customer generator
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
could be a member of the group as long
 
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
as that customer generator did not net
 
02:14:40.970 --> 02:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
meter him or herself would that be
 
02:14:44.330 --> 02:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
something that could be clarifying for
 
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
this legislation I think that would be
 
02:14:50.450 --> 02:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
counter to the intent of the legislation
 
02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.169 align:start position:0%
counter to the intent of the legislation
um

02:14:51.169 --> 02:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:52.970 --> 02:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
for the reason we don't it isn't fair uh
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
and it's unnecessary it's an it's an
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
infringement to exclude
 
02:15:05.089 --> 02:15:05.099 align:start position:0%
a customer who is simply who is net
 
02:15:05.099 --> 02:15:07.069 align:start position:0%
a customer who is simply who is net
metering

02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
metering
 
02:15:07.079 --> 02:15:08.569 align:start position:0%
metering
um

02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
from also being a member of a group is
 
02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:12.050 align:start position:0%
from also being a member of a group is
because

02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:14.330 align:start position:0%
because
um

02:15:14.330 --> 02:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:15:15.770 --> 02:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
customer-sighted generation you know
 
02:15:17.579 --> 02:15:20.149 align:start position:0%
customer-sighted generation you know
rarely

02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
rarely meets the the needs of that the
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
total energy needs of that customer all
 
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
the time it's the
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
uh rare is the building who's who's
 
02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
energy needs can be met by a solar array
 
02:15:34.129 --> 02:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
on the roof
 
02:15:36.410 --> 02:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
so you put solar all over the roof that
 
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
you can if you're an industrial customer
 
02:15:40.970 --> 02:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
say down in Hudson in the in the energy
 
02:15:45.649 --> 02:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.450 --> 02:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
most of the time there's no net metering
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
going on because the
 
02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:49.729 align:start position:0%
going on because the
um

02:15:49.729 --> 02:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
consumption in that building is so high
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
but sometimes uh
 
02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
you know again a couple of months of the
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
year a couple of days of the month there
 
02:16:03.290 --> 02:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
may be some exporting going on
 
02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
and that's the only time when you know
 
02:16:07.550 --> 02:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
net metering is in play that that that
 
02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
customer generator is getting paid by
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
for the energy they export
 
02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
the utility is immediately reselling
 
02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
that energy to the to their next door
 
02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:17.810 align:start position:0%
that energy to the to their next door
neighbor

02:16:17.810 --> 02:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
neighbor
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
um but you know other members
 
02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:21.530 align:start position:0%
um but you know other members
um

02:16:21.530 --> 02:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:23.209 --> 02:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
so they might want to join a group net
 
02:16:24.770 --> 02:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
metering arrangement
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
to have more of their energy come from
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
solar and they're you know they're still
 
02:16:30.890 --> 02:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
paying for that energy they're not it's
 
02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
02:16:42.650 --> 02:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for introducing
 
02:16:45.410 --> 02:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Bill 161
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
next I'll call upon
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
Griffin robarge from the Department of
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
energy to give us the Department's
 
02:16:54.650 --> 02:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation proposed
 
02:16:54.660 --> 02:17:05.810 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation proposed
legislation

02:17:05.810 --> 02:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

foreign
 
02:17:09.410 --> 02:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos members of the
 
02:17:10.849 --> 02:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
committee for the record again Griffin
 
02:17:12.889 --> 02:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
Roberge State energy program manager at
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
02:17:16.610 --> 02:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
is opposed to House Bill 161 as
 
02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
is opposed to House Bill 161 as
introduced

02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:17:23.929 --> 02:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
um for background uh this state statute
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
was modified and I should say State
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
Statute itself was modified in 2013 to
 
02:17:32.209 --> 02:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
establish uh group net metering the
 
02:17:34.429 --> 02:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
statute permits net metered renewable
 
02:17:36.889 --> 02:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
energy facilities known as group hosts
 
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
to share the proceeds of surplus
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
electricity generation with other
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
electric utility account holders known
 
02:17:47.570 --> 02:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
as group members group members must not
 
02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
be customer generators themselves under
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
the current statute and do not need uh
 
02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh do not need to be customer
 
02:17:56.570 --> 02:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
generated as was originally outlined
 
02:17:58.610 --> 02:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
when the statute was created and do not
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
need to make any changes to their
 
02:18:02.209 --> 02:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
existing electric service in these
 
02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:04.019 align:start position:0%
arrangements as has been discussed the
 
02:18:06.770 --> 02:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
total load of the group host plus all
 
02:18:08.690 --> 02:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
the group members must be greater or
 
02:18:11.330 --> 02:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
equal to the annual generation output
 
02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
from the group host generation
 
02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
the theory behind this statute when it
 
02:18:18.410 --> 02:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
was created was to direct the benefits
 
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
of net metering to customers or group
 
02:18:22.610 --> 02:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
members who could not take advantage of
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
net metering themselves because they did
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
not have the means to fund or construct
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
a net metering facility either a
 
02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
customer generator acting as a group
 
02:18:35.089 --> 02:18:35.099 align:start position:0%
host either you're on one side or the
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
other of a certain line either you are a
 
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
group host and you're a customer
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
generator and you're sharing those
 
02:18:43.610 --> 02:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
benefits with group members or you are a
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
group or you're a member of that group
 
02:18:46.849 --> 02:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
you're not a customer generator yourself
 
02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
you couldn't be on both sides of the
 
02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
line simultaneously last year Senate
 
02:18:54.610 --> 02:18:54.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 262 which was signed into law
 
02:18:56.690 --> 02:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
originally sought to remove the
 
02:18:58.849 --> 02:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
requirement as House Bill 161 is doing
 
02:18:58.859 --> 02:19:00.009 align:start position:0%
requirement as House Bill 161 is doing
here

02:19:00.009 --> 02:19:00.019 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
remove the requirement that group
 
02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
members shall not be customer generators
 
02:19:07.849 --> 02:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
themselves public testimony as Senate
 
02:19:09.770 --> 02:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 262 is working its way through the
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislative process indicated that the
 
02:19:15.290 --> 02:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
statute was limiting to to uh to
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal group host net metering
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
Arrangements group host Arrangements
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't be formed in a Municipality of
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
say a fire station or a town hall had a
 
02:19:26.450 --> 02:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
net meter facility on it and you had a
 
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
larger you know group host down the road
 
02:19:31.549 --> 02:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
um doe at that time proposed language
 
02:19:35.089 --> 02:19:35.099 align:start position:0%
which you see online five to six which
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
would narrowly allow an exception for
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions such as cities
 
02:19:42.610 --> 02:19:42.620 align:start position:0%
towns counties chartered public schools
 
02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
and certain types of customer generators
 
02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
in another area of statute
 
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
that language was amended before this
 
02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
committee and was ultimately what was
 
02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
signed into law giving municipalities a
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
great flexibility
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
um for these group host net meeting
 
02:19:58.849 --> 02:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
arrangements and as I mentioned that
 
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
language is found on lines five to six
 
02:20:02.570 --> 02:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
that's the exception
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned House Bill 161 seeks
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
to accomplish what Senate Bill 262 last
 
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
year originally intended the bill would
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
broadly expand the number and types of
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
customers who can take part in group net
 
02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
metering Arrangements including group
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
members who are already customer
 
02:20:20.210 --> 02:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
generators themselves in our opinion
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
this policy changed significantly Alters
 
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
the intent of the group net metering
 
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
statute from one that seeks to direct
 
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
net metering benefits to those who
 
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
cannot be customer generators themselves
 
02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
to those who may already have the means
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
of controlling their energy costs as
 
02:20:36.910 --> 02:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
customer generators
 
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
we do see we do view this as a
 
02:20:41.210 --> 02:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
department as a sizable change as I
 
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned to the group metering statute
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
and as a note the puc currently has an
 
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
ongoing docket looking into revisions to
 
02:20:52.809 --> 02:20:52.819 align:start position:0%
the net energy metering tariffs in
 
02:20:56.090 --> 02:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
de-22-060 I think the department would
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest laying the puc
 
02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
arrive at those decisions through that
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
adjudication uh with an active
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement process through
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
an active adjudication before making
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
substantial changes as is being proposed
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
in house bill 161.
 
02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
should the committee feel differently
 
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
and wish to move forward with the
 
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
proposed language unamended doe would
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
suggest removing the language on lines
 
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
five to six if the intent is to allow
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
customer generators to be group members
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
and group host Arrangements removing the
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
sentence on or sorry retaining the
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
sentence on lines five to six would make
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
a little sense it's just kind of hanging
 
02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:33.710 align:start position:0%
a little sense it's just kind of hanging
there

02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:34.309 align:start position:0%
there
um

02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
and with that happy to take uh any
 
02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
02:21:47.929 --> 02:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:21:50.809 --> 02:21:50.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to figure the flow of
 
02:21:54.170 --> 02:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
all this if this bill passed and maybe
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
you can help me out with it a little bit
 
02:21:58.730 --> 02:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
it would appear that if you're a
 
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
customer generator and you're also a net
 
02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
in your your net need ring and then you
 
02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
become part of a group that also has a
 
02:22:08.330 --> 02:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
generator because obviously that's why
 
02:22:10.429 --> 02:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
you would join so then your options
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
could be you could net meter onto the
 
02:22:15.170 --> 02:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
grid you could obviously consume your
 
02:22:17.809 --> 02:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
own electricity you could Supply
 
02:22:21.969 --> 02:22:21.979 align:start position:0%
electricity to the group host uh
 
02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
entity or you could collect electricity
 
02:22:27.650 --> 02:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
from the group host and how would we
 
02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
keep track of all these different
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
options if they indeed are all options
 
02:22:33.170 --> 02:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question um when it
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
comes to group host net medium
 
02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
Arrangements there are
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
um applications that need to take place
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
so people submit obviously to the New
 
02:22:41.570 --> 02:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy in order
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
to enter into these type of arrangements
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
and then detail how benefits are
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
allocated out
 
02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
um if the language were to go forward
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
you know utilities also you know
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
ascertain how much generation is being
 
02:22:57.170 --> 02:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
consumed within the group I imagine if
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
you have customer generators in that
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
that utilities would likely measure the
 
02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
net from that customer generator who's a
 
02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
group member so they might be
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
net metering themselves and consuming
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
some of that power
 
02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
the difference that they maybe aren't
 
02:23:15.950 --> 02:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
meeting with their own facility would
 
02:23:17.929 --> 02:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
likely be used to calculate on the group
 
02:23:19.969 --> 02:23:19.979 align:start position:0%
net metering Arrangement
 
02:23:19.979 --> 02:23:20.650 align:start position:0%
net metering Arrangement
um

02:23:20.650 --> 02:23:20.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:23.450 --> 02:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
back up I guess holistically is that you
 
02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
know I think the department feels is
 
02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:25.910 align:start position:0%
know I think the department feels is
that

02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
the intent of the statute as was
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
originally prescribed years ago was to
 
02:23:32.090 --> 02:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
drive the benefits of net metering to
 
02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
those who cannot take advantage of net
 
02:23:36.410 --> 02:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
metering themselves with this bill is to
 
02:23:38.270 --> 02:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
go forward you are allowing those who
 
02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
are already customer generators to then
 
02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
also get the benefit of group host net
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
metering as well we just feel like that
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's a sizable change from what's been
 
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.010 align:start position:0%
that's a sizable change from what's been
intended

02:23:49.010 --> 02:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
intended
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up and but you would
 
02:23:53.929 --> 02:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
agree that this creates a much larger
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
complication than just trying to keep
 
02:23:57.050 --> 02:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
track of all the flow of the power
 
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
because of all these various options
 
02:24:00.170 --> 02:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
that now would be I think folks in our
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
consumer division would would agree with
 
02:24:03.530 --> 02:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
that sentiment thank you
 
02:24:06.290 --> 02:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question and you may or may
 
02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
not know the answer to this but there
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
was a case in California in 2021
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
pertaining to a Ponzi scheme where the
 
02:24:19.969 --> 02:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
host was a solar provider and then group
 
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
members were solar members and each
 
02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
group member was to bring on more so or
 
02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
solar members and it was found to be I
 
02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
think the owner of found find 30 years
 
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
in prison would this pause could this
 
02:24:34.610 --> 02:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
possibly happen in this case if this
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
bill was to where hosts and the
 
02:24:40.010 --> 02:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
generators could both and uh generators
 
02:24:42.290 --> 02:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
could also become
 
02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
could also become
um

02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
combining the group at the same time
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
producing itself thank you for the
 
02:24:49.130 --> 02:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
question I would be reluctant to assume
 
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
that something like that could take
 
02:24:51.770 --> 02:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
place in New Hampshire I'm not overly
 
02:24:54.650 --> 02:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
familiar with the circumstances that you
 
02:24:56.570 --> 02:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
refer to in California obviously each
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
state has different
 
02:25:00.349 --> 02:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
um net metering laws and that type of
 
02:25:01.370 --> 02:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not sure if there was
 
02:25:03.889 --> 02:25:03.899 align:start position:0%
something that was applicable more to
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
California than maybe what would be done
 
02:25:07.969 --> 02:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so
 
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
um respectfully I couldn't comment too
 
02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
much on that but thank you
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for being
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
here again
 
02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:19.250 align:start position:0%
here again
um

02:25:19.250 --> 02:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
apologize if I missed something in your
 
02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:22.309 align:start position:0%
apologize if I missed something in your

02:25:22.319 --> 02:25:23.270 align:start position:0%

um

02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
there is an exception for political
 
02:25:28.730 --> 02:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so towns and can join can
 
02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:29.870 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so towns and can join can
can

02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
be a customer generator and join a group
 
02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:33.290 align:start position:0%
be a customer generator and join a group
host

02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
host
 
02:25:36.889 --> 02:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
um presumably that was because there was
 
02:25:39.710 --> 02:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
a benefit to them in terms of lower
 
02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
a benefit to them in terms of lower
rates

02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
and if that is in fact the case then why
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you know other consumers have
 
02:25:50.570 --> 02:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
the same benefit of a rate reduction
 
02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I think I
 
02:25:54.650 --> 02:25:54.660 align:start position:0%
just back up a little bit to when the
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
group I'm sorry the municipal host
 
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
um statute was created this will the
 
02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:01.610 align:start position:0%
um statute was created this will the
statute

02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
um allows Municipal hosts to operate
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
above one megawatt but less than five to
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
group net meter with political
 
02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
subdivision so that cities towns what
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
have you
 
02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I think the theory behind that was
 
02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:13.670 align:start position:0%
um I think the theory behind that was
that

02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
um obviously the legislature decided
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
that that's something worthwhile to
 
02:26:19.250 --> 02:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
direct benefit to municipalities but
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
that never existed before so you might
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
have had municipalities who might not
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the load to satisfy a
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
group host net metering Arrangements
 
02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
such as under the municipal host statute
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
going back to the example you might have
 
02:26:33.889 --> 02:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
a fire station or a town hall that
 
02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
already had
 
02:26:35.580 --> 02:26:36.170 align:start position:0%
already had
um

02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
a solar facility on it
 
02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
um they couldn't include that in a group
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
host net metering Arrangement so what
 
02:26:44.929 --> 02:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
was done last year was it created that
 
02:26:46.849 --> 02:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
narrow carve out to give a little bit of
 
02:26:49.730 --> 02:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
a narrower flexibility to municipalities
 
02:26:51.889 --> 02:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
given the expansion of of uh the net
 
02:26:53.809 --> 02:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
meter and crap for municipal host
 
02:26:53.819 --> 02:26:55.250 align:start position:0%
meter and crap for municipal host
statute

02:26:55.250 --> 02:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
um I think broadly I guess expanding
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
that and just saying you can be a
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
customer generator or whatever you can
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
now take part in these group hosts would
 
02:27:05.530 --> 02:27:05.540 align:start position:0%
be a sizable change from what was done
 
02:27:07.969 --> 02:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
under the municipal host statute and
 
02:27:11.450 --> 02:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:27:13.439 --> 02:27:14.030 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
granted it would be a significant change
 
02:27:18.770 --> 02:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
but would it have a positive impact on
 
02:27:18.780 --> 02:27:22.969 align:start position:0%
but would it have a positive impact on
rates

02:27:22.969 --> 02:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
if you're asking me for like a specific
 
02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
data or anything like that I couldn't
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
give that right now but I think I would
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
defer just because the pews as I
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned the puc is currently
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
adjudicating this issue and determining
 
02:27:35.929 --> 02:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
whether any changes to the net metering
 
02:27:38.929 --> 02:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
tariffs should take place I'm sure for
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
folks that it would you know I'm sure
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
for folks there would be a benefit if
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
you're a customer generator yourself and
 
02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
want to take part in a group host net
 
02:27:48.170 --> 02:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
medium Arrangement but again we've
 
02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
always viewed the intent of the statute
 
02:27:51.410 --> 02:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
with directing the benefits of group
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
host and net metering to those who
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
cannot take advantage of be a customer
 
02:27:58.090 --> 02:27:58.100 align:start position:0%
generator themselves
 
02:28:01.550 --> 02:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative partial no McWilliams has
 
02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
a question thank you chair Bose um and
 
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Roberts for your testimony
 
02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Roberts for your testimony
today

02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
a question about
 
02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
um the value of distributed Energy
 
02:28:13.969 --> 02:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
report yes where we determine there's
 
02:28:15.650 --> 02:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
less than one percent cost shifting in
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
large net metering or really any net
 
02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:19.130 align:start position:0%
large net metering or really any net
metering

02:28:19.130 --> 02:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
metering
 
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so I want to understand I I know we
 
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
were dipping our toes in the water when
 
02:28:25.849 --> 02:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
we first started in 2013 with the
 
02:28:28.130 --> 02:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
legislative intent either to be a group
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
host or a member you couldn't be on both
 
02:28:31.730 --> 02:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
sides of the line and now it looks like
 
02:28:33.290 --> 02:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
we're starting to open things up to
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities to your point so I guess
 
02:28:36.770 --> 02:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
my question is how many customer
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
generators does this proposed Bill
 
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
exempt so thank you for the question
 
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to at least maybe shop that
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
around with our consumer services
 
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
division just because they register
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
these group hosts and that type of thing
 
02:28:51.849 --> 02:28:51.859 align:start position:0%
I I not aware that the department
 
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
currently registers folks for being an
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
independent customer generator it's more
 
02:28:58.130 --> 02:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
for I believe cut group host net
 
02:28:59.870 --> 02:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
metering arrangements as is defined in
 
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
the statute regarding the vder study you
 
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
know obviously that study was not was
 
02:29:07.610 --> 02:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
brought about per puc order in an
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
earlier net metering docket the study
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
was crafted in an effort to kind of pave
 
02:29:15.050 --> 02:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
the way for the puc's future
 
02:29:16.969 --> 02:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
adjudication looking into net metering
 
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
statutes into whether cost shifting is
 
02:29:23.090 --> 02:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
occurring obviously the vder study found
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
very very very minimal effects of cost
 
02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
shifting but broadly the questions of to
 
02:29:30.290 --> 02:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
whether or not cost shifting is
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
occurring is an open question that's
 
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
currently pending before the puc the
 
02:29:36.290 --> 02:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
vder study we would submit is a part of
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
that is a part of maybe answering that
 
02:29:42.290 --> 02:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
question so sizable changes such as this
 
02:29:44.450 --> 02:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
I think we would suggest
 
02:29:46.849 --> 02:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
should maybe be reserved for when the
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
puc finally reaches its its uh reaches
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
a conclusion date of this puc follow-up
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
to the vder study I thought we were
 
02:30:04.490 --> 02:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
pretty much clear that it's new so what
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
is the date of this next study sure
 
02:30:07.610 --> 02:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question so
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
I know the P the puc issued an order
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
early last year opening up
 
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
um uh potential revisions to the net
 
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
metering statute I can certainly share
 
02:30:18.770 --> 02:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
that notice with folks here on the
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee in the first paragraph of that
 
02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing this for memory it's cited
 
02:30:25.130 --> 02:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 261 from last year and House
 
02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
Bill 1599 as reasons to potentially open
 
02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
up the docket again to look at net
 
02:30:33.889 --> 02:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
metering statute so again letting the
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
puc to fully adjudicate these issues
 
02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
before making sizable changes might be
 
02:30:40.610 --> 02:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
something for the legislature to
 
02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:45.170 align:start position:0%
something for the legislature to
consider

02:30:45.170 --> 02:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
the committee we want to thank you Mr
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
Roberts thank you
 
02:30:53.690 --> 02:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
presenting the Department's perspective
 
02:30:56.450 --> 02:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
on this legislation next I'll call
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
the final person who has signed up to
 
02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill and that's
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
Jim Monahan who is representing revision
 
02:31:05.399 --> 02:31:08.330 align:start position:0%
Jim Monahan who is representing revision
energy

02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:11.809 --> 02:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
good morning uh good morning
 
02:31:11.819 --> 02:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
good morning uh good morning
um

02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:14.570 --> 02:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I'm Jim Monahan with the
 
02:31:16.370 --> 02:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
DuPont group I'm here today on behalf of
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
revision energy I'm glad I got to speak
 
02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
class because I think there was some
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
clarity that came through the questions
 
02:31:23.210 --> 02:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
where I think we can resolve some of the
 
02:31:25.490 --> 02:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
open issues before the committee
 
02:31:28.910 --> 02:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
um let me just say the uh uh the uh
 
02:31:31.070 --> 02:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
practical issues that we're trying to
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
resolve with this bill are situations
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
where a group is forming or a group has
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
formed for net metering and a customer
 
02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
who already has
 
02:31:46.490 --> 02:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
self-generating typically a solar panel
 
02:31:48.130 --> 02:31:48.140 align:start position:0%
wants to join the group
 
02:31:50.090 --> 02:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:31:52.730 --> 02:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
um uh there's nothing a state law that
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
says that customer can't join the group
 
02:31:57.530 --> 02:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't necessarily expand it but
 
02:31:59.870 --> 02:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
what it does as a practical matter the
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
situation says but that existing solar
 
02:32:04.730 --> 02:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
rate you have on your roof you have to
 
02:32:07.730 --> 02:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
unplug it and take it take it away you
 
02:32:09.889 --> 02:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
can't make it part of the group so I
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
think Representatives I actually had a
 
02:32:14.570 --> 02:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
client yesterday who signed off an email
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
saying um Clarity is kindness and I
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
think you offered some kindness and your
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
observations the intention here is to
 
02:32:25.130 --> 02:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
avoid double dipping not to allow for it
 
02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
so I think your suggestion that language
 
02:32:29.210 --> 02:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
be put in the bill to be clear that
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
we're not allowing the existing
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
self-generator to double dip is is will
 
02:32:37.370 --> 02:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
add Clarity to the conversation here so
 
02:32:39.050 --> 02:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
um you know the Practical
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
um situation we're offering here is not
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
to expand group net metering beyond the
 
02:32:49.309 --> 02:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
limitations that they're now uh it
 
02:32:50.929 --> 02:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change the credits suit
 
02:32:52.610 --> 02:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect many of the issues or
 
02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
any of the issues perhaps that the of
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
the puc is considering in the in the
 
02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
Vita study is just trying to deal with a
 
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
very practical situation where somebody
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
decided to self-generate several years
 
02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
ago and now there's the opportunity for
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
them to join a group they should be able
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
to do so they shouldn't be allowed to
 
02:33:10.730 --> 02:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
double dip and we want to get rid of
 
02:33:13.070 --> 02:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
that that situation so we can come up
 
02:33:14.690 --> 02:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
with some hopefully work with you in the
 
02:33:16.010 --> 02:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
committee to come up with language of
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
that I can talk to the Department of
 
02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
energy to see if it resolves some of
 
02:33:21.170 --> 02:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
their concerns
 
02:33:24.410 --> 02:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:33:27.290 --> 02:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
uh there's one last thing that and I'll
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
talk to Griff about this but and I just
 
02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
caught it now but on line eight uh of
 
02:33:36.290 --> 02:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
the bill uh it makes reference to
 
02:33:38.570 --> 02:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
um the the host shall provide a list of
 
02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
members to the commission but the
 
02:33:42.770 --> 02:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
balance of the bill talks about
 
02:33:44.330 --> 02:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
providing information to the department
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
I think this is just one of the and I
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
can double check this with an apartment
 
02:33:48.889 --> 02:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
I just think it's one more of those
 
02:33:50.809 --> 02:33:50.819 align:start position:0%
situations when you created a department
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
of energy uh you transferred
 
02:33:54.290 --> 02:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility this is just we're
 
02:33:55.790 --> 02:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
catching them as we come along I think
 
02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's probably something that uh we
 
02:34:00.050 --> 02:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
want to correct here as well so as long
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
as we're if we if we are working on an
 
02:34:04.910 --> 02:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
amendment or do that uh with regard to
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
um Mr Griffin's observations that uh if
 
02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:11.819 align:start position:0%
this uh bill is enacted uh I you know I
 
02:34:14.210 --> 02:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
think there's right it may again be kind
 
02:34:18.290 --> 02:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
with Clarity and remove the uh uh or you
 
02:34:19.849 --> 02:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
may not need the political subdivision
 
02:34:21.650 --> 02:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
carve out because you'd be allowing this
 
02:34:24.290 --> 02:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
for for uh anyone that came to it
 
02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
finally from a another practical concern
 
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that is that if a existing generator
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
self-generator is going to join a group
 
02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
and they surrender their uh their the
 
02:34:38.650 --> 02:34:38.660 align:start position:0%
credit responsibility and join the hope
 
02:34:41.210 --> 02:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
it may mean that the group group then
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
can build a smaller
 
02:34:45.230 --> 02:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
self-generating facility because they'd
 
02:34:48.410 --> 02:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
be able to move the power uh from the
 
02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
existing facility uh uh into the into
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
the larger group so there's that cost
 
02:34:56.450 --> 02:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
savings for the group and and for the
 
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
the members that are there so I don't
 
02:35:01.250 --> 02:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
see this necessarily as a huge in a
 
02:35:02.809 --> 02:35:02.819 align:start position:0%
certainly Department of energy that can
 
02:35:04.910 --> 02:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
change my mind in this uh this is some
 
02:35:06.170 --> 02:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:35:08.530 --> 02:35:08.540 align:start position:0%
um substantial uh change in things
 
02:35:10.730 --> 02:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
particularly if we're not allowing the
 
02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:11.710 align:start position:0%
particularly if we're not allowing the
the

02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
double dipping um and honestly the uh as
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
I said before we're not asking to change
 
02:35:20.570 --> 02:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
the current restrictions on the size and
 
02:35:22.610 --> 02:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
composition of a group
 
02:35:24.170 --> 02:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that and answer any
 
02:35:28.969 --> 02:35:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:31.370 --> 02:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:35:35.570 --> 02:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question so do I understand
 
02:35:38.570 --> 02:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
correctly that as long as there would be
 
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
some language added to this bill as an
 
02:35:43.730 --> 02:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
amendment to prohibit double dipping
 
02:35:45.770 --> 02:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
that you would be in favor of it
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes thank you and I apologize
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
for not having you know throughout the
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
course of the summer the folks at
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
revision works with many of the
 
02:35:55.849 --> 02:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
utilities to work out the mechanics of
 
02:35:58.370 --> 02:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
this we just the presumption was we were
 
02:35:59.570 --> 02:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
attempting to eliminate the double
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
dipping we think we did but adding it in
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't create any harm to what
 
02:36:05.690 --> 02:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
we're trying to achieve here and in fact
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
creates the clarity we think would be
 
02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:09.170 align:start position:0%
creates the clarity we think would be
helpful

02:36:09.170 --> 02:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
clearing up some of this stuff just to
 
02:36:18.170 --> 02:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Corman so as
 
02:36:21.469 --> 02:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
I understood what you said what you want
 
02:36:23.450 --> 02:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
to do is
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
not is allow someone that has a solar
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
panel for example who wants to join the
 
02:36:32.330 --> 02:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
group allow them to not have to unplug
 
02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
the panel like they have to do now
 
02:36:37.969 --> 02:36:37.979 align:start position:0%
correct but then all but also not get
 
02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
any kind of financial benefit
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
by virtue of tapping into net metering
 
02:36:46.010 --> 02:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
twice right they'd have to surrender and
 
02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
no longer take the credit they get from
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
the utility instead they would get the
 
02:36:52.490 --> 02:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
the benefit as being a part of the the
 
02:36:55.010 --> 02:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
group and the host would manage that
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
um compensation for them okay thank you
 
02:36:59.809 --> 02:36:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:59.819 --> 02:37:01.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:37:01.010 --> 02:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:04.370 --> 02:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
my question would be about the language
 
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
that Mr robarge referred to in lines six
 
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
or pardon me five and six the exception
 
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
that was added last year
 
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
as an amendment the house bill 2 or
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.050 --> 02:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
essentially that ex exemption was
 
02:37:27.290 --> 02:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
designed to deal with political
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
subdivisions correct so
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
let's take my town of Epping as an
 
02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:36.170 align:start position:0%
let's take my town of Epping as an
example

02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:37:40.849 --> 02:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
let's say uh we put a we have a a solar
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
installation on our our Municipal safety
 
02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:46.370 align:start position:0%
installation on our our Municipal safety
complex

02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
complex
 
02:37:49.610 --> 02:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
and revision energy comes in and they
 
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
want to put up a solar array and add our
 
02:37:57.889 --> 02:37:57.899 align:start position:0%
library and our town hall and
 
02:38:00.530 --> 02:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
um our historical society and other
 
02:38:02.530 --> 02:38:02.540 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings
 
02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
to a group
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
for which they become the host
 
02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:08.330 align:start position:0%
for which they become the host
[Music]

02:38:08.330 --> 02:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
this exemption would allow our safety
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
complex which also has solar panels on
 
02:38:19.309 --> 02:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
is the motivation for revision energy
 
02:38:26.809 --> 02:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
to try to gobble up all of the potential
 
02:38:29.570 --> 02:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
load that a town has
 
02:38:34.429 --> 02:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh so as to build the biggest possible
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
facility that it can
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore net meter as much power as
 
02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
it possibly can
 
02:38:44.929 --> 02:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
under the under the current law is that
 
02:38:44.939 --> 02:38:46.429 align:start position:0%
under the under the current law is that
yes

02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
well um
 
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
I'd have to get I'd have to talk to them
 
02:38:55.010 --> 02:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
but I think the the general and I you
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
know we can have folks that come in and
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
size these things for customers I think
 
02:38:59.450 --> 02:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
the general sense is that you're trying
 
02:39:02.809 --> 02:39:02.819 align:start position:0%
to build the solar facility to match the
 
02:39:05.450 --> 02:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
load and so there's you know they're
 
02:39:08.210 --> 02:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
just trick to getting that right
 
02:39:09.650 --> 02:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure the
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
gobble up is the industry term that
 
02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
they're necessarily use but I think
 
02:39:17.690 --> 02:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
they're trying to match it but I think
 
02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
they you know if you're going to be in
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
the business of uh working for the town
 
02:39:25.370 --> 02:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
of Epping you want to maximize the value
 
02:39:27.889 --> 02:39:27.899 align:start position:0%
so I think that they would try to to do
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
that and the example of your safety
 
02:39:30.889 --> 02:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
complex they would want to be able to
 
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
use that facility to help you know feed
 
02:39:35.050 --> 02:39:35.060 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal facilities so that's
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
the the what was allowed for under the
 
02:39:43.010 --> 02:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
provisions of Senate Bill 262 last year
 
02:39:45.650 --> 02:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
so you didn't have that ironic situation
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
where your safety building in Epping
 
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
which already has solar wouldn't be part
 
02:39:51.530 --> 02:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
of the group you'd want it to be it
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
would make sense for that
 
02:39:56.690 --> 02:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
to occur and this simply makes the same
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh adjustment for uh residential
 
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
businesses Farms other people that want
 
02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
are willing to surrender their current
 
02:40:08.929 --> 02:40:08.939 align:start position:0%
credit to become part of a group
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
02:40:15.290 --> 02:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
representative munz I'm thank you Mr
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm sorry I just just thought
 
02:40:20.330 --> 02:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
of something yeah I mean and you know
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance but
 
02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:23.750 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance but
um

02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:27.050 --> 02:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
if if you know let's say that let's use
 
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
the town of Epping where they're they're
 
02:40:30.050 --> 02:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
getting their own net metering credit
 
02:40:32.330 --> 02:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
and then they join a group and you know
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
they could get another credit
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
is there anything that prevents somebody
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's a customer generator a customer a
 
02:40:41.210 --> 02:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
customer generator
 
02:40:43.790 --> 02:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's already getting a rate from then
 
02:40:46.429 --> 02:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
sharing that rate with everybody else in
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
addition to the rate the net metering
 
02:40:51.530 --> 02:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
rate they get as part of the group
 
02:40:53.090 --> 02:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm coming back to is is
 
02:40:55.309 --> 02:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
there a is is there a potential benefit
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
to all of the members of the group by
 
02:41:00.889 --> 02:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
having double dipping
 
02:41:04.370 --> 02:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
I my instinct says no you double
 
02:41:06.349 --> 02:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
dippings usually looked as a as
 
02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
something you wouldn't necessarily yeah
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
so you know I and
 
02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
you know I presume the example that
 
02:41:14.809 --> 02:41:14.819 align:start position:0%
representative votes talked about is
 
02:41:16.490 --> 02:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
that the safety building in Epping
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't double dip you know they've come
 
02:41:21.170 --> 02:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
to some sort of a mechanism to ensure
 
02:41:23.389 --> 02:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
that that wouldn't happen if that but I
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
think adding that Clarity in the in the
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
statute makes sense
 
02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:41:32.809 --> 02:41:32.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just trying to
 
02:41:34.429 --> 02:41:34.439 align:start position:0%
get my handle on this double dipping so
 
02:41:35.809 --> 02:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
let me just kind of walk through a
 
02:41:37.010 --> 02:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
little bit and see if I've got it and
 
02:41:38.990 --> 02:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong
 
02:41:41.929 --> 02:41:41.939 align:start position:0%
um right now you have someone who is a
 
02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
net metering generator and they're
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
generating out uh you know through the
 
02:41:48.290 --> 02:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
net metering statute and uh they put
 
02:41:49.849 --> 02:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're putting a power on the
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
grid sometimes they're consuming it and
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
then there's a group organization that
 
02:41:58.730 --> 02:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
is made up of a generator and then other
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
customers who consume electricity and
 
02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
they sometimes produce enough
 
02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
electricity for the whole group
 
02:42:05.870 --> 02:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're taking it Off the Grid
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes they may even be exporting it
 
02:42:09.889 --> 02:42:09.899 align:start position:0%
onto the grid now when you combine the
 
02:42:12.650 --> 02:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
two of them together what the double
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
dipping part that you want to eliminate
 
02:42:17.929 --> 02:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
is the ability for both generators to
 
02:42:19.910 --> 02:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
export independently onto the Grid or
 
02:42:22.849 --> 02:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
the net meter so they would only go the
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
electricity from the the new generator
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
joining the group could only go for
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
their own use or for use for the other
 
02:42:31.730 --> 02:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
people in the group but they couldn't
 
02:42:34.849 --> 02:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
net meter it as an individual while they
 
02:42:36.170 --> 02:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
were part of the group is that what
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.210 --> 02:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
um I think so but so the situation
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
talked about would be you know both the
 
02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
incumbent the Legacy facility and the
 
02:42:48.889 --> 02:42:48.899 align:start position:0%
new facility would both
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh export into the you know in into the
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
grid but the Legacy customer
 
02:42:58.969 --> 02:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
uh would would not get
 
02:43:02.330 --> 02:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
the existing credit Arrangement he or
 
02:43:03.889 --> 02:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
she has with the utility they would
 
02:43:07.130 --> 02:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
surrender surrender that and instead be
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
compensated by
 
02:43:11.389 --> 02:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
the host and the host is managing both
 
02:43:13.849 --> 02:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
the new generating facility and the
 
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
Legacy facility when it comes to export
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay and just a quick follow-up I just
 
02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:19.130 align:start position:0%
okay and just a quick follow-up I just
yes

02:43:19.130 --> 02:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:20.030 align:start position:0%
yes
um

02:43:20.030 --> 02:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:23.090 --> 02:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier the department of
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
energy person I just wonder how
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
complicated this is going to be to
 
02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
manage from a from a rate point of view
 
02:43:29.809 --> 02:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
to keep track of it I don't know if the
 
02:43:31.130 --> 02:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
utilities are putting any thought to
 
02:43:32.809 --> 02:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
that yet but it'd be interesting to
 
02:43:34.429 --> 02:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
figure out if it's if this is something
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
that it can it it first of all can it be
 
02:43:38.929 --> 02:43:38.939 align:start position:0%
done and how complicated is it going to
 
02:43:41.630 --> 02:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
be to do it so yeah uh usually when I
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
get questions like that I say well we
 
02:43:45.290 --> 02:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
gave these people an absolute Monopoly
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
they can figure it out but I won't say
 
02:43:48.170 --> 02:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
that today
 
02:43:50.270 --> 02:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
um so I you know but there is I think
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
there is a an emerging responsibility in
 
02:43:54.050 --> 02:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
the part of the utility is to come up
 
02:43:55.849 --> 02:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
with mechanisms to handle this type of
 
02:43:57.950 --> 02:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
thing particularly as the legislature
 
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
and policy makers you know will it be at
 
02:44:02.270 --> 02:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
the expansion of Municipal net meeting
 
02:44:04.849 --> 02:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
last year I think it's you know uh that
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
there may be some administrative
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
challenges but I think they're up to the
 
02:44:10.969 --> 02:44:10.979 align:start position:0%
task all right thank you and I have
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
heard you say not say that many times in
 
02:44:16.370 --> 02:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm being kind this morning
 
02:44:20.990 --> 02:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
02:44:23.330 --> 02:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
so again we're not trying to change the
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
world here we're trying to address a
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
practical situation we're a you know uh
 
02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
02:44:32.510 --> 02:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
a host situation should be welcoming of
 
02:44:33.889 --> 02:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
somebody who's already kind of made the
 
02:44:35.330 --> 02:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
investment we just want to handle the
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
mechanics to make sure that they they
 
02:44:40.010 --> 02:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
can join we're not and and we're not
 
02:44:42.770 --> 02:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
trying to create any extra
 
02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
um uh benefit to either the host or the
 
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
generator that's participating
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay so you know further
 
02:44:54.590 --> 02:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions I would like to ask Mr Roberts
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
if you could come back up uh because
 
02:44:59.090 --> 02:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
because I have a question about how this
 
02:45:01.070 --> 02:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
whole group net metering
 
02:45:04.730 --> 02:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
Arrangement Works in practice and I'm
 
02:45:06.530 --> 02:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
hopeful that you can maybe provide an
 
02:45:09.770 --> 02:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.809 --> 02:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos I will try if I
 
02:45:14.210 --> 02:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
can't I will follow that up with the
 
02:45:16.250 --> 02:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
committee okay thank you so here's my
 
02:45:19.610 --> 02:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
question it was my understanding
 
02:45:22.490 --> 02:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
that the way group net metering works
 
02:45:26.990 --> 02:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
is that the host the customer generator
 
02:45:28.849 --> 02:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
who's the host
 
02:45:33.050 --> 02:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
when he supplies his power to the group
 
02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
when he supplies his power to the group
members

02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's treated as net metered power and
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
he receives credit
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
against the power that he sends out to
 
02:45:49.370 --> 02:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
the group members at the at the net
 
02:45:51.469 --> 02:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
metering rate
 
02:45:54.170 --> 02:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
is that the way net group net metering
 
02:45:56.030 --> 02:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
works I believe that to be the case yes
 
02:45:59.090 --> 02:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
so you follow under uh depending on the
 
02:46:00.590 --> 02:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
size of the group host obviously you'd
 
02:46:02.270 --> 02:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
fall under the applicable net metering
 
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
tariff so 1.0 2.0 whether or not you're
 
02:46:09.050 --> 02:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
one to 100 kilowatt one 100 kilowatts to
 
02:46:10.969 --> 02:46:10.979 align:start position:0%
one megawatt
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
um obviously any type of application to
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
have a any type of desire to enter a
 
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
group PostNet mirror Arrangement as Mr
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
Monahan did point out
 
02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
um does not go to the puc anymore it
 
02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
goes to the department so I would agree
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
um that probably a good housekeeping
 
02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
change on line eight would make sense
 
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
from commission to department
 
02:46:33.050 --> 02:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
but all of those are reviewed by the
 
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
department they were they are uh all of
 
02:46:36.349 --> 02:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
the applications are reviewed by the
 
02:46:39.290 --> 02:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
department to ensure that they are in
 
02:46:41.330 --> 02:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
conformance with State Statute and
 
02:46:43.250 --> 02:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
administrative rule
 
02:46:46.670 --> 02:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
um yes I'll stop there I'm rambling
 
02:46:49.849 --> 02:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
so just to sum up the benefit to the
 
02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
members of the group is that the host is
 
02:46:56.450 --> 02:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
receiving compensation that allows him
 
02:46:59.210 --> 02:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
to charge group members less money for
 
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
it can but there's also and I can unpack
 
02:47:02.809 --> 02:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more with follow-up to
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
the committee there is also the option
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
for on bill crediting so that members
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
group members see a direct benefit on
 
02:47:10.969 --> 02:47:10.979 align:start position:0%
their electric bill from these group
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
hostnet meeting Arrangements
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
um what you're describing group host
 
02:47:17.630 --> 02:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
gets a benefit and then disperses it I
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
think that's an option but it's not the
 
02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
only option I guess I could say great
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification I
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
all right representative Harrington has
 
02:47:28.849 --> 02:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
a question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
02:47:30.290 --> 02:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
let me take my question I'm still trying
 
02:47:32.210 --> 02:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
to follow the logic on this so let's
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
let's get to the world where we have
 
02:47:36.770 --> 02:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
these we have an existing uh group that
 
02:47:39.230 --> 02:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
has net metering in it and they they
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
just like I said before they would
 
02:47:42.950 --> 02:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
either their options are they produce
 
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
electricity from their solar facility
 
02:47:47.450 --> 02:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
some days they consume it all some days
 
02:47:49.490 --> 02:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
they have uh Surplus and they put it
 
02:47:52.790 --> 02:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
back on the grid uh some days they have
 
02:47:55.250 --> 02:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
to import from the grid now we bring in
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
this new second generator comes in who
 
02:47:59.330 --> 02:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
was previously net metering let's say
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
they're all under a megawatt so they're
 
02:48:02.690 --> 02:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
on the default service rate is to make
 
02:48:05.210 --> 02:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
things simplify so that person was doing
 
02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
basically the same thing as an
 
02:48:08.929 --> 02:48:08.939 align:start position:0%
individual and they were selling it
 
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
exporting it to the grid and getting
 
02:48:12.830 --> 02:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
default service rate sometimes they
 
02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
import sometimes they cover their own
 
02:48:16.969 --> 02:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
use with their own generation now when
 
02:48:20.210 --> 02:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
they join that of that other group what
 
02:48:22.490 --> 02:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
how is the electricity they produce
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
treated is it when they
 
02:48:28.250 --> 02:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
produce it and it goes into other group
 
02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
members is that just internal to the
 
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
group or do they get they get default
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
service rate for that how does that work
 
02:48:38.510 --> 02:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not uh thank you for the question if
 
02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's all right I would like to follow up
 
02:48:41.809 --> 02:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
with you just because Amanda Noonan on
 
02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
our and our consumer services division
 
02:48:44.809 --> 02:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
can probably vet that a little bit more
 
02:48:46.429 --> 02:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
thoroughly than I can sitting here right
 
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
here and now her team goes through that
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
quite quite often and I think they're a
 
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
little bit more familiar with the
 
02:48:53.450 --> 02:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
changes with the narrow exception that
 
02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
was proposed in Senate Bill 262 I
 
02:48:57.230 --> 02:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
realized the urgency and getting more
 
02:48:58.849 --> 02:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
information on this so let me unpack
 
02:49:00.290 --> 02:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
that with staff and I'll follow up all
 
02:49:01.309 --> 02:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
right thank you because it is pretty
 
02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
confusing that's Bob thank you
 
02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
who would be the correct person within
 
02:49:08.929 --> 02:49:08.939 align:start position:0%
the doe to give us a tutorial on group
 
02:49:10.969 --> 02:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
net metering it would likely be uh
 
02:49:10.979 --> 02:49:12.290 align:start position:0%
net metering it would likely be uh
Deandra

02:49:12.290 --> 02:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
Deandra
 
02:49:13.790 --> 02:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not even going to try pronouncing
 
02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
her last name and I'm hoping she's not
 
02:49:17.690 --> 02:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
watching because I'm going to butcher it
 
02:49:19.969 --> 02:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
um but Amanda Noonan as well
 
02:49:21.650 --> 02:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
um there is a slightly we do have a page
 
02:49:23.929 --> 02:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
on our website to kind of give a a high
 
02:49:25.790 --> 02:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
level overview of as to how group net
 
02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
mirroring Arrangements work
 
02:49:30.530 --> 02:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
um but Deanna Deandra has been out sick
 
02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
and Amanda Noonan has been out of the
 
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
office as well so I want to talk to them
 
02:49:35.870 --> 02:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit more before presenting
 
02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
information make sure it's accurate
 
02:49:40.190 --> 02:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
okay I may ask the department to give us
 
02:49:42.770 --> 02:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
a tutorial on group net metering at some
 
02:49:44.570 --> 02:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
point in the future it'll probably be a
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
couple of months down the road but
 
02:49:49.849 --> 02:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
just alert them if you will to the fact
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
that we will be looking for that just to
 
02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
make sure we fully understand it yep
 
02:49:54.359 --> 02:49:55.550 align:start position:0%
make sure we fully understand it yep
okay

02:49:55.550 --> 02:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:49:57.410 --> 02:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming up and answering
 
02:50:00.290 --> 02:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
our questions is there anyone else in
 
02:50:03.050 --> 02:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
the audience who would like to speak on
 
02:50:07.490 --> 02:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close this
 
02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 161 and ask
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative closure to give us the
 
02:50:17.150 --> 02:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
blue sheet
 
02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:21.349 align:start position:0%
blue sheet
statistics

02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:25.070 --> 02:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Bulls House Bill 161
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet was seven in favor
 
02:50:32.530 --> 02:50:32.540 align:start position:0%
none opposed online it was 66 in favor
 
02:50:35.570 --> 02:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
none opposed
 
02:50:37.610 --> 02:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that concludes our morning activity
 
02:50:42.530 --> 02:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
lunch break starts right now
 
02:50:47.230 --> 02:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
and we will return here at 1 30 to hear
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
the next bill on our list which is house
 
02:50:54.650 --> 02:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
bill 165. so we'll see you then have a
 
02:51:13.610 --> 02:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:13.620 --> 04:30:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:30:16.010 --> 04:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:00.170 --> 04:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.090 --> 04:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay ladies and gentlemen Gentlemen
 
04:31:05.149 --> 04:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
let's resume our activity for today the
 
04:31:09.170 --> 04:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
final day of January for 2023. at the
 
04:31:10.849 --> 04:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
beginning of our session this morning I
 
04:31:13.370 --> 04:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned that representative Thomas and
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to do some experimentation
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
with our scheduling and wanted to get
 
04:31:21.769 --> 04:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
the input of the members of the
 
04:31:23.450 --> 04:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
04:31:23.460 --> 04:31:26.149 align:start position:0%
committee on
our

04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.969 --> 04:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
ideas our plans
 
04:31:31.610 --> 04:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
so the first plan was to schedule public
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
hearings for one half hour each instead
 
04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
of an hour
 
04:31:40.370 --> 04:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
and if any public hearing exceeded that
 
04:31:42.050 --> 04:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
30-minute span
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
we would open the next public hearing
 
04:31:48.290 --> 04:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
but then return to the previous public
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
hearing and leave the the subsequent
 
04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing open until we got to it
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
some other committees do business this
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
way and it seems to work for them
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate often does business this way
 
04:32:03.889 --> 04:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
in fact the Senate sometimes even
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
schedules bills at 15-minute intervals
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
so that's one idea that we're we're
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
toying with and
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to get a sense from members
 
04:32:18.910 --> 04:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee if they'd be willing to
 
04:32:21.469 --> 04:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
experiment with that idea for a couple
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
of sessions a couple of committee uh
 
04:32:26.450 --> 04:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
sessions and see how it works uh
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas yes thank
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
you I'd just like to to clarify that you
 
04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
spoke with representative Doug Thomas
 
04:32:37.130 --> 04:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
I feel that's very important okay
 
04:32:41.929 --> 04:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas and I came up
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
with this idea just reversed me as the
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
taller one
 
04:32:47.809 --> 04:32:47.819 align:start position:0%
the taller Thomas
 
04:32:50.090 --> 04:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
helped us come up with that idea the
 
04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
other idea that we want to bounce off
 
04:32:52.920 --> 04:32:53.929 align:start position:0%
other idea that we want to bounce off
people

04:32:53.929 --> 04:32:53.939 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:32:56.809 --> 04:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
I've been scheduling exec sessions at
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
four o'clock in the afternoon
 
04:32:59.159 --> 04:33:01.429 align:start position:0%
four o'clock in the afternoon
and

04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:03.769 --> 04:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
that runs the risk that we might be here
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
until five or six or
 
04:33:07.789 --> 04:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
potentially even seven o'clock in the
 
04:33:07.799 --> 04:33:08.689 align:start position:0%
potentially even seven o'clock in the
evening

04:33:08.689 --> 04:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
evening
 
04:33:10.490 --> 04:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
which makes for a long day
 
04:33:13.849 --> 04:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
so representative Doug Thomas and I have
 
04:33:16.429 --> 04:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
discussed the potential of moving exec
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
Shadow sessions to either the first
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
thing in the morning at nine o'clock or
 
04:33:22.970 --> 04:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
moving them to one o'clock in the
 
04:33:22.980 --> 04:33:23.929 align:start position:0%
moving them to one o'clock in the
afternoon

04:33:23.929 --> 04:33:23.939 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
04:33:25.970 --> 04:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
and then potentially having public
 
04:33:28.730 --> 04:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
hearings after the exec sessions does
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
anybody have any strong feelings about
 
04:33:33.170 --> 04:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
that representative Kaplan yeah I would
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
have a strong objection to doing it at
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
nine in the morning just because of my
 
04:33:37.970 --> 04:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
own personal situation I you know I I
 
04:33:40.010 --> 04:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
work in the mornings so that would make
 
04:33:41.810 --> 04:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
it very difficult for me
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
how about one o'clock that would be
 
04:33:44.039 --> 04:33:45.051 align:start position:0%
how about one o'clock that would be
acceptable

04:33:45.051 --> 04:33:45.061 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
04:33:47.929 --> 04:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
representative barajny I have the same
 
04:33:49.490 --> 04:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
situation one o'clock would work better
 
04:33:50.810 --> 04:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:53.570 --> 04:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington anything's
 
04:33:54.650 --> 04:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
better than four
 
04:33:56.109 --> 04:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thompson Thomas
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you but this just to make clear
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
this would not add another hearing day
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
right this would just adjust times yes
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%
the the idea is we'd still meet on
 
04:34:11.570 --> 04:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
Mondays and Tuesdays we wouldn't add a
 
04:34:13.730 --> 04:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
third day except in the case of this
 
04:34:16.131 --> 04:34:16.141 align:start position:0%
week where we got snowed out I would
 
04:34:17.810 --> 04:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
prefer one o'clock
 
04:34:21.730 --> 04:34:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
no other feelings from the committee
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay so when you see the schedule for
 
04:34:31.070 --> 04:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
next week oh representative partial
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
um I'd just like to weigh in on the idea
 
04:34:37.609 --> 04:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
of how things work in the Senate
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
um or in my particular case how things
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
don't work I think 15 minutes is really
 
04:34:44.631 --> 04:34:44.641 align:start position:0%
too brief I I would be happy to
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
experiment with a half hour but I would
 
04:34:49.369 --> 04:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
urge you to avoid the logger gems that
 
04:34:50.810 --> 04:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
we have in the Senate when people are
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
waiting to testify there in this thing
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
about people waiting in the hall
 
04:34:57.051 --> 04:34:57.061 align:start position:0%
yes I would never go to 15 minutes I
 
04:34:58.609 --> 04:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
just mentioned that they did it that way
 
04:35:01.730 --> 04:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
in the Senate just to be illustrative of
 
04:35:04.131 --> 04:35:04.141 align:start position:0%
other ways of doing things
 
04:35:07.609 --> 04:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
so when you see your schedule next week
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
we will probably experiment with doing
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.131 --> 04:35:16.141 align:start position:0%
and we'll just do it for one week and
 
04:35:18.170 --> 04:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
see how it goes and then we'll decide we
 
04:35:19.970 --> 04:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
want to keep doing it this way or do we
 
04:35:22.369 --> 04:35:22.379 align:start position:0%
want to go back to an hour what seems to
 
04:35:22.379 --> 04:35:23.090 align:start position:0%
want to go back to an hour what seems to
work

04:35:23.090 --> 04:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
and then we'll also schedule our public
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
hearings not at four o'clock
 
04:35:31.131 --> 04:35:31.141 align:start position:0%
probably not at nine o'clock so it's
 
04:35:33.590 --> 04:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
probably one o'clock but we'll make that
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
determination you'll you'll see it in
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
the calendar next week representative
 
04:35:37.320 --> 04:35:39.289 align:start position:0%
the calendar next week representative
McWilliams

04:35:39.289 --> 04:35:39.299 align:start position:0%
McWilliams
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chairman Bose I think
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
that half an hour makes a lot of sense
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
but we might want to just allow a little
 
04:35:47.090 --> 04:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
bit of catch-up time so I would propose
 
04:35:49.369 --> 04:35:49.379 align:start position:0%
normally we would do 9 to 12 three bills
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
if we did 9 to 11 30 five bills and it
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
allows that half hour for running to
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
noon for the lunch break that might give
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
us a buffer
 
04:36:01.250 --> 04:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay good suggestion representative Doug
 
04:36:04.730 --> 04:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr yeah that's exactly
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
what I proposed to the chair so thank
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
you for that
 
04:36:07.320 --> 04:36:07.990 align:start position:0%
you for that
um

04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:11.810 --> 04:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
this will perhaps uh perhaps shouldn't
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
be doesn't have to be said but maybe
 
04:36:13.320 --> 04:36:14.230 align:start position:0%
be doesn't have to be said but maybe
does

04:36:14.230 --> 04:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:36:17.170 --> 04:36:17.180 align:start position:0%
with this type of schedule it will
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
incentivize people to stick to the
 
04:36:22.609 --> 04:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
selling points of their comments and
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
their testimony uh perhaps we can get
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
better you know Point said during that
 
04:36:29.929 --> 04:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
brief time period so other people can
 
04:36:32.269 --> 04:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
grief as well within the uh same time
 
04:36:32.279 --> 04:36:34.070 align:start position:0%
grief as well within the uh same time
period

04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:36:35.689 --> 04:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
good point
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
any further comments on this proposal or
 
04:36:40.010 --> 04:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
these proposals
 
04:36:42.289 --> 04:36:42.299 align:start position:0%
representative notter
 
04:36:44.090 --> 04:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think it's one
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
of those things where if you wash the
 
04:36:47.150 --> 04:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
car it's going to rain so if you
 
04:36:48.769 --> 04:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
schedule 15 minutes we're going to have
 
04:36:50.750 --> 04:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
a room full of people if you schedule an
 
04:36:52.849 --> 04:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
hour we will have a 15-minute hearing
 
04:36:54.890 --> 04:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
this is the way it goes
 
04:36:56.631 --> 04:36:56.641 align:start position:0%
there is a certain amount of that that's
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
life right it's called life so okay well
 
04:37:03.369 --> 04:37:03.379 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving us your sense of of
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
how things might go we'll do some
 
04:37:07.970 --> 04:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
experimenting next week and then
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
will regroup and discuss how it went and
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
then chart a path forward from there
 
04:37:18.709 --> 04:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
so with that we can now move on to the
 
04:37:20.750 --> 04:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
business of the afternoon which is to
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
open a public hearing on House Bill
 
04:37:26.929 --> 04:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
165. relative to Department of energy
 
04:37:29.689 --> 04:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
procedures in lieu of meeting renewable
 
04:37:32.209 --> 04:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards for biomass and I'll
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
call on the prime sponsor of House Bill
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
165 representative Michael Harrington to
 
04:37:49.869 --> 04:37:49.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
this should be relatively easy
 
04:37:55.609 --> 04:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
um because of a confusion in my spot
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
when I was writing these actually I was
 
04:37:59.449 --> 04:37:59.459 align:start position:0%
on vacation trying to get lsrs caught up
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
anyways uh I'd like to itl the bill the
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
um class one class three
 
04:38:09.289 --> 04:38:09.299 align:start position:0%
um renewable portfolio requirement is
 
04:38:11.209 --> 04:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
now administratively been lowered to one
 
04:38:13.131 --> 04:38:13.141 align:start position:0%
percent because it just simply isn't
 
04:38:17.090 --> 04:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
enough uh pre-2006 wood burning plants
 
04:38:20.090 --> 04:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
to make up the higher number so uh this
 
04:38:22.250 --> 04:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
bill has become basically unnecessary so
 
04:38:24.769 --> 04:38:24.779 align:start position:0%
I just I can't withdraw it so I'm hoping
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
everyone will agree with me just vote
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
IDL and I'll take any questions
 
04:38:31.369 --> 04:38:31.379 align:start position:0%
anybody any questions for representative
 
04:38:31.379 --> 04:38:35.449 align:start position:0%
anybody any questions for representative
Harrington

04:38:35.449 --> 04:38:35.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.689 --> 04:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess you're off the hook
 
04:38:40.250 --> 04:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
I have a pink card here from Jason stock
 
04:38:49.730 --> 04:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
of the Timberland Owners Association now
 
04:38:52.131 --> 04:38:52.141 align:start position:0%
Mr stock
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify on both
 
04:38:56.990 --> 04:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and the next bill which is
 
04:38:59.689 --> 04:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
house bill 166.
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:39:04.490 --> 04:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly willing to allow that so
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
Mr stock if you want to come and give us
 
04:39:08.810 --> 04:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
your your take on these two bills I
 
04:39:10.910 --> 04:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
guess your take on 165 will be pretty
 
04:39:10.920 --> 04:39:12.170 align:start position:0%
guess your take on 165 will be pretty
brief

04:39:12.170 --> 04:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
brief
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:39:15.769 --> 04:39:15.779 align:start position:0%
you can let us know your feelings about
 
04:39:19.849 --> 04:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
166 and be economical with your time or
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
if you would prefer you could just wait
 
04:39:23.929 --> 04:39:23.939 align:start position:0%
until 166.
 
04:39:23.939 --> 04:39:25.189 align:start position:0%
until 166.
um

04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:25.199 --> 04:39:36.590 align:start position:0%
um
okay

04:39:36.590 --> 04:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.410 --> 04:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
so representative Thomas Doug Thomas
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
just asked me the question can this
 
04:39:45.050 --> 04:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
testimony be accepted if if the bill
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
hasn't been introduced
 
04:39:50.930 --> 04:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
so that's a relevant question so maybe
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
we should ask you to wait until we
 
04:39:59.330 --> 04:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
another reason for a half hour public
 
04:40:02.040 --> 04:40:03.050 align:start position:0%
another reason for a half hour public
hearing

04:40:03.050 --> 04:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams my
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.350 --> 04:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
rank exact immediately would it make
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
sense to use this time to exec the bill
 
04:40:22.030 --> 04:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to um we're
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
going to ask you Mr stock to hang on for
 
04:40:30.288 --> 04:40:30.298 align:start position:0%
a little while uh we'll ask you to come
 
04:40:30.298 --> 04:40:31.250 align:start position:0%
a little while uh we'll ask you to come
back

04:40:31.250 --> 04:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
um for 166. I don't want to risk your
 
04:40:39.170 --> 04:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
testimony not being valid for 166 so
 
04:40:41.570 --> 04:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
what we will do then is uh let's see
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
nope that was for 166.
 
04:40:53.330 --> 04:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
so nobody else has signed up to speak on
 
04:40:55.670 --> 04:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 165
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
is there anybody in the audience who
 
04:41:01.368 --> 04:41:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.530 --> 04:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I'm going to close the
 
04:41:07.010 --> 04:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 165.
 
04:41:10.010 --> 04:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
and now I will open an executive session
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 165
 
04:41:15.288 --> 04:41:15.298 align:start position:0%
and recognize representative Harrington
 
04:41:17.810 --> 04:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
for a motion uh I moved to uh make the
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
bill itl inappropriate to legislate
 
04:41:25.250 --> 04:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
a recognize representative McWilliams
 
04:41:27.890 --> 04:41:27.900 align:start position:0%

seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
04:41:42.050 --> 04:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
the roll on the question of itl for
 
04:41:47.930 --> 04:41:47.940 align:start position:0%

chairman Vose yes
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%

nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
 
04:43:17.050 --> 04:43:17.060 align:start position:0%
fifteen fifteen years
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:23.448 --> 04:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
so the motion to itl house built 165
 
04:43:23.458 --> 04:43:24.890 align:start position:0%
so the motion to itl house built 165
passes

04:43:24.890 --> 04:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
passes
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
without objection I'll make sure that it
 
04:43:29.208 --> 04:43:29.218 align:start position:0%
goes on the consent calendar and
 
04:43:30.650 --> 04:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington if you could
 
04:43:33.890 --> 04:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
write a brief committee report
 
04:43:36.890 --> 04:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
and have that to me by the end of the
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the executive
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 165.
 
04:43:51.890 --> 04:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately we now have
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
45 minutes
 
04:43:55.490 --> 04:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
that we have to wait until we can start
 
04:43:58.670 --> 04:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:58.680 --> 04:44:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
this committee will be in recess until 2
 
04:44:02.760 --> 04:44:04.310 align:start position:0%
this committee will be in recess until 2
30.

04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
30.
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:17.878 --> 05:30:41.570 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:30:41.570 --> 05:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
foreign okay good afternoon everybody
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
time to open a public hearing on House
 
05:30:51.050 --> 05:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
Bill 166 relative to the elimination of
 
05:30:53.628 --> 05:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
useful thermal energy from renewable
 
05:30:56.448 --> 05:30:56.458 align:start position:0%
energy classes
 
05:30:59.390 --> 05:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
any of you in the audience who were here
 
05:31:02.628 --> 05:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
back at 1 30 when we resumed our
 
05:31:04.788 --> 05:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon activity here we'll recall a
 
05:31:07.368 --> 05:31:07.378 align:start position:0%
discussion we had about scheduling our
 
05:31:09.288 --> 05:31:09.298 align:start position:0%
public hearings for one half hour
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
instead of an hour
 
05:31:14.810 --> 05:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
so I'd like you all to pretend that this
 
05:31:17.390 --> 05:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
is a half hour public hearing
 
05:31:20.448 --> 05:31:20.458 align:start position:0%
and base your
 
05:31:23.990 --> 05:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
comments on that time frame let's see
 
05:31:26.750 --> 05:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
how it goes Let's do an experiment
 
05:31:29.628 --> 05:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to uh introduce
 
05:31:31.128 --> 05:31:31.138 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this bill
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Harrington to
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
introduce the legislation the proposed
 
05:31:35.400 --> 05:31:47.090 align:start position:0%
introduce the legislation the proposed
legislation

05:31:47.090 --> 05:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good afternoon
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a few parts to this bill but
 
05:31:54.590 --> 05:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
I want to kind of explain what the
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
purpose of it and why I've brought it
 
05:31:58.670 --> 05:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
forward and one of the things we always
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
hear about is transparency in government
 
05:32:04.010 --> 05:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
everybody gives uh platitudes to a
 
05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
transparency we want to know people know
 
05:32:07.970 --> 05:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
what's going on we shouldn't be hiding
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
things in the layers of bureaucratic
 
05:32:12.708 --> 05:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
Bowl uh people should be straight out
 
05:32:15.530 --> 05:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
know what's going on but in this case
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
if you ask the average person in New
 
05:32:19.730 --> 05:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if their electric bill was
 
05:32:21.410 --> 05:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
higher because they were subsidizing
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
someone burning wood chips in a furnace
 
05:32:25.970 --> 05:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
someplace they'd either laugh at you or
 
05:32:27.470 --> 05:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
say I have no idea what you're talking
 
05:32:29.448 --> 05:32:29.458 align:start position:0%
about but that is indeed what happens
 
05:32:32.090 --> 05:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
we've been using the electric bills to
 
05:32:35.390 --> 05:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
hide subsidies to selected companies who
 
05:32:38.090 --> 05:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
are very good at lobbying uh down here
 
05:32:40.730 --> 05:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
in Concord and get bills passed to get
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
them subsidies at the expense of the
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
electric rate payers
 
05:32:45.770 --> 05:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
the rate payers are under a lot of
 
05:32:48.350 --> 05:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
pressure we've been hearing now all the
 
05:32:50.270 --> 05:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
last couple of weeks how rates are high
 
05:32:52.610 --> 05:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
we need to do something there's only so
 
05:32:54.350 --> 05:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
much we can do here on the state level
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
because so much is controlled on the
 
05:32:57.770 --> 05:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
regional and federal level
 
05:32:59.690 --> 05:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
but there are a few things and every
 
05:33:01.610 --> 05:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
time someone brings one up someone says
 
05:33:03.650 --> 05:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
well it's only going to be ten dollars
 
05:33:05.750 --> 05:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
or it's only going to be 15 but you know
 
05:33:08.208 --> 05:33:08.218 align:start position:0%
eventually those add up and they do show
 
05:33:10.010 --> 05:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
the rate pays that at least we're trying
 
05:33:10.020 --> 05:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
the rate pays that at least we're trying
so

05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:13.610 --> 05:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
first reason for this bill is
 
05:33:16.430 --> 05:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
transparency let's get the hidden tax on
 
05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
electricity out get rid of it if people
 
05:33:21.410 --> 05:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
feel that burning wood chips is such a
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
great idea then let them put a tax on
 
05:33:27.410 --> 05:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
oil or gas or something where it comes
 
05:33:29.690 --> 05:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
out and says tax to subsidize burning
 
05:33:31.788 --> 05:33:31.798 align:start position:0%
wood chips and everyone will know what
 
05:33:33.050 --> 05:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
they're paying for anyways that's
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
transparency in government
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
second with the amount of we've been
 
05:33:39.170 --> 05:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
told about and I think I mentioned this
 
05:33:40.670 --> 05:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
earlier if we've heard about it on the
 
05:33:42.590 --> 05:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
radio we've heard people testifying here
 
05:33:44.868 --> 05:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
about it there are billions that would
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
be billions of dollars of federal tax
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
dollars your tax dollars they're going
 
05:33:52.250 --> 05:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
to be spent on virtually anything that
 
05:33:54.770 --> 05:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
resembles Energy Efficiency or renewable
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
any energy projects anything you can
 
05:33:58.850 --> 05:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
possibly think of that would fit into
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
that category is going to be eligible
 
05:34:02.810 --> 05:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
for billions of dollars we don't need to
 
05:34:04.610 --> 05:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
be spending New Hampshire rate pays
 
05:34:06.230 --> 05:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
dollars on the same thing there's
 
05:34:07.550 --> 05:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
probably more money going to be out
 
05:34:09.410 --> 05:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
there in companies could actually handle
 
05:34:12.530 --> 05:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
but again there's so many billions of
 
05:34:14.270 --> 05:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
dollars on the federal level this is our
 
05:34:16.250 --> 05:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to save our state rate
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
payers something
 
05:34:18.240 --> 05:34:19.490 align:start position:0%
payers something
it's

05:34:19.490 --> 05:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:34:21.770 --> 05:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
also the fact is you're going to hear
 
05:34:23.208 --> 05:34:23.218 align:start position:0%
always they'll come out and say this and
 
05:34:24.410 --> 05:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
this happens on every one of these
 
05:34:25.850 --> 05:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
programs it's not unique to this
 
05:34:27.288 --> 05:34:27.298 align:start position:0%
particular bill or even this particular
 
05:34:30.050 --> 05:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
industry well if we collect all this
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
money and we put it in a big bucket and
 
05:34:34.010 --> 05:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
give it to some bureaucrats then they're
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to spend it and they're going to
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
say it's going to create millions of
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
jobs or thousands of jobs and create to
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
stimulate the economy but they never
 
05:34:43.368 --> 05:34:43.378 align:start position:0%
talk about how many jobs would have been
 
05:34:44.990 --> 05:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
created and how much the economy would
 
05:34:46.970 --> 05:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
have been stimulated if we allowed the
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
people to keep their own money and spend
 
05:34:50.868 --> 05:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
it as they thought was the best way to
 
05:34:53.208 --> 05:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
do it my contention is that they're
 
05:34:54.590 --> 05:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
going to be much more efficient than
 
05:34:57.410 --> 05:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
spending the money than the government's
 
05:34:59.868 --> 05:34:59.878 align:start position:0%
going to be and it'll create more jobs
 
05:35:02.330 --> 05:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
and stimulate the economy more and the
 
05:35:03.590 --> 05:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
government won't be in the position to
 
05:35:05.448 --> 05:35:05.458 align:start position:0%
pick winners and losers and I say this
 
05:35:07.730 --> 05:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
with some experience because as a former
 
05:35:10.128 --> 05:35:10.138 align:start position:0%
puc commissioner I used to sign grants
 
05:35:11.930 --> 05:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
for thousands and thousands of dollars
 
05:35:14.270 --> 05:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
to selected companies that would get
 
05:35:15.708 --> 05:35:15.718 align:start position:0%
money from the rate pays because that
 
05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
was part of my job I had no I couldn't
 
05:35:19.850 --> 05:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
all I could do is the best of my ability
 
05:35:22.010 --> 05:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
I certainly could not do it
 
05:35:24.590 --> 05:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I gotta tell you I had no skin in
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
the game on that there was no it was not
 
05:35:28.368 --> 05:35:28.378 align:start position:0%
like I was spending my own money and
 
05:35:29.570 --> 05:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
that's the same for everybody else
 
05:35:31.010 --> 05:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to spend their own
 
05:35:32.570 --> 05:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
money with more care and consideration
 
05:35:34.070 --> 05:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
what's best for them and their family
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
than the some government bureaucrat's
 
05:35:38.570 --> 05:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
going to spend it for somebody else most
 
05:35:40.610 --> 05:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
people can't afford the time to come
 
05:35:42.530 --> 05:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
down here and hire lobbyists and pay
 
05:35:44.810 --> 05:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
them thousands of dollars to lobby for
 
05:35:47.208 --> 05:35:47.218 align:start position:0%
more subsidies from the rate payers some
 
05:35:49.010 --> 05:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
businesses can and I'm sure after I
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
stopped speaking you'll hear from them
 
05:35:54.170 --> 05:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
so people are more efficient at spending
 
05:35:55.250 --> 05:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
their own money
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
and there's also just a simple fact of
 
05:35:59.330 --> 05:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
force versus Freedom there's nothing
 
05:36:02.090 --> 05:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
that stops people from subsidizing or
 
05:36:04.368 --> 05:36:04.378 align:start position:0%
buying these uh Energy Efficiency or
 
05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
wood products you can buy as much as
 
05:36:07.970 --> 05:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
they want but what we're saying
 
05:36:10.250 --> 05:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
basically is no no no the government
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
knows better we are smarter than the
 
05:36:15.288 --> 05:36:15.298 align:start position:0%
average person the average person won't
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
do the right thing if they're allowed
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
the freedom to make that decision for
 
05:36:20.810 --> 05:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
themselves so we're going to force them
 
05:36:23.810 --> 05:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
to subsidize in this case useful thermal
 
05:36:26.208 --> 05:36:26.218 align:start position:0%
energy which has really nothing to do
 
05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
with electric rates other than like I
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
said there was very good lobbyists were
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
able to come down and get that put in
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
there as a bill because we have a lot of
 
05:36:36.770 --> 05:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
wood chip manufacturers uh in in the
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
state so
 
05:36:40.430 --> 05:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
as far as a technical part of the bill
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
because of what we did last earlier
 
05:36:45.230 --> 05:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
today on 165 Section 3 would be removed
 
05:36:47.448 --> 05:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
completely it's no longer necessary so
 
05:36:50.570 --> 05:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
that part that won't change the section
 
05:36:52.910 --> 05:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
on page the other part that's a major
 
05:36:55.970 --> 05:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
change is on page one uh where it talks
 
05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
about the various classes and again it
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
puts a cap on these classes otherwise
 
05:37:01.850 --> 05:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
they're going to grow and grow and grow
 
05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it's again it comes down to the
 
05:37:07.970 --> 05:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
simple fact if anybody in the state I
 
05:37:09.530 --> 05:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
don't know most people may or may not be
 
05:37:11.090 --> 05:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
aware there's a law in the state of New
 
05:37:13.368 --> 05:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that says every utility must
 
05:37:17.150 --> 05:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
offer up to 100 Renewable Power to any
 
05:37:18.650 --> 05:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
one of the people that takes default
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
service well you don't hear too much
 
05:37:23.090 --> 05:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
about that because back a few years ago
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
the utilities came to the puc and they
 
05:37:27.708 --> 05:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
petitioned it and said you know we're
 
05:37:30.590 --> 05:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
getting somewhere around point zero
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
percent of the people voluntarily
 
05:37:34.910 --> 05:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
signing up to pay more for Renewable
 
05:37:37.010 --> 05:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
Power so the commission had the
 
05:37:39.110 --> 05:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
authority under the law to suspend that
 
05:37:40.970 --> 05:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
law but that law could be brought back
 
05:37:43.190 --> 05:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
and the utilities could do it so the way
 
05:37:45.288 --> 05:37:45.298 align:start position:0%
with it's the way with all is there if
 
05:37:48.530 --> 05:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
people want to pay extra for solar or
 
05:37:50.990 --> 05:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
wind or wood chips or useful thermal
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
energy or not useful thermology but the
 
05:37:54.470 --> 05:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
other ones they can certainly do that
 
05:37:56.510 --> 05:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
would apply to any of these classes in
 
05:37:58.970 --> 05:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
the RPS standard they simply have to say
 
05:38:01.128 --> 05:38:01.138 align:start position:0%
they want it and they can get it but you
 
05:38:03.170 --> 05:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
know what they're not saying that so
 
05:38:04.850 --> 05:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
again the government has stepped in and
 
05:38:07.490 --> 05:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
said we know better than you do the
 
05:38:09.410 --> 05:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
average person is too stupid to be left
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
with a decision on how to buy
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
electricity so the government must
 
05:38:16.070 --> 05:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
substitute their judgment for them and
 
05:38:17.330 --> 05:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I don't think that's
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
necessary I think the people of New
 
05:38:20.330 --> 05:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are smart enough to make these
 
05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves it wouldn't
 
05:38:24.350 --> 05:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate the RPS but it would put the
 
05:38:27.650 --> 05:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
brakes on it again all this idea of
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
building new renewable energy is more
 
05:38:32.270 --> 05:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
than going to be covered by billions of
 
05:38:34.490 --> 05:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
dollars in federal grants and federal
 
05:38:36.350 --> 05:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
programs that are going to be coming out
 
05:38:38.270 --> 05:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to punish the people of
 
05:38:40.730 --> 05:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
no New Hampshire any further for not
 
05:38:42.770 --> 05:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
quote buying the right type of energy
 
05:38:45.590 --> 05:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
voluntarily I think given to their own
 
05:38:47.868 --> 05:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
choice they'll do quite well and I'm
 
05:38:49.970 --> 05:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Harrington
 
05:38:54.650 --> 05:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
for introducing this legis proposed
 
05:38:56.810 --> 05:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Summers asked
 
05:38:59.090 --> 05:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman just a
 
05:39:01.250 --> 05:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
very quick question from what we the
 
05:39:03.890 --> 05:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard last week I believe
 
05:39:06.350 --> 05:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
and would you believe not excuse me and
 
05:39:09.230 --> 05:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
rephrase that is it true that
 
05:39:11.590 --> 05:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts no longer considers
 
05:39:14.570 --> 05:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
burning wood as a renewable energy
 
05:39:18.110 --> 05:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
resource it's I I it's very restrictive
 
05:39:20.270 --> 05:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
on there I I think it's I don't know the
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
exact numbers but it has to do with the
 
05:39:24.650 --> 05:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
thermal efficiency of the plant and to
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
get a full wreck in Massachusetts would
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
be impossible because I think you need a
 
05:39:29.690 --> 05:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
thermal efficiency of somewhere around
 
05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
40 or 50 percent which burning green
 
05:39:34.190 --> 05:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
would you can never even get close to
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
they run around 18 so they have some but
 
05:39:39.050 --> 05:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's very limited on that thermal
 
05:39:43.070 --> 05:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:45.530 --> 05:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
05:39:45.540 --> 05:39:47.150 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
Kaplan

05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
Kaplan
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
05:39:51.470 --> 05:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this bill
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I would agree with uh most of your
 
05:39:54.770 --> 05:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
assessment and what you know the
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
philosophical approach that you're
 
05:39:58.670 --> 05:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
taking to uh the RPS I just you know I
 
05:40:00.830 --> 05:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you
 
05:40:03.230 --> 05:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
would you ever consider that Society has
 
05:40:06.650 --> 05:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
a greater responsibility to make changes
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the way we do anything uh that would
 
05:40:12.770 --> 05:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
outweigh an individual's right to make
 
05:40:14.930 --> 05:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
an immediate choice in the marketplace I
 
05:40:16.730 --> 05:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
mean is there any circumstance that you
 
05:40:18.770 --> 05:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
would ever think that an individual's
 
05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
right to make a choice a consumer choice
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
is outweighed by you know the greater
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
public good well and certainly I'm I'm
 
05:40:27.770 --> 05:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
not going to sit here and try to list
 
05:40:28.970 --> 05:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
them but I'm certainly think someone
 
05:40:30.410 --> 05:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
could come up with one where I would say
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
I would agree with it but in this case
 
05:40:33.890 --> 05:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
it simply isn't necessary because the
 
05:40:36.170 --> 05:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
mechanism is there the law is already
 
05:40:38.270 --> 05:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
passed if we all we have to do is
 
05:40:40.190 --> 05:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
reinstate that which could be done by a
 
05:40:42.530 --> 05:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
puc decision or a request of the
 
05:40:44.510 --> 05:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
utilities for that matter and anybody
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
that wants to get 80 percent uh 90 100
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
could get it out of the utilities and
 
05:40:51.948 --> 05:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
even beyond that if you go to
 
05:40:53.930 --> 05:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers I know I was
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
talking to uh uh Peters I always screw
 
05:40:59.930 --> 05:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
up his last name Psalms some help me out
 
05:40:59.940 --> 05:41:02.530 align:start position:0%
up his last name Psalms some help me out
Michael

05:41:02.530 --> 05:41:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:04.970 --> 05:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
a couple of months ago and he was
 
05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
telling me how with the higher electric
 
05:41:08.330 --> 05:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
rates he was like because he had gone in
 
05:41:10.970 --> 05:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
for 100 wind power at eight cents a
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour for a three-year contract
 
05:41:16.128 --> 05:41:16.138 align:start position:0%
so it's very possible to do that and you
 
05:41:18.890 --> 05:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
people can choose that for themselves we
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't need the government making them
 
05:41:22.368 --> 05:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
choose for because basically what
 
05:41:23.990 --> 05:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're saying is if you don't choose
 
05:41:25.368 --> 05:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
right you're going to pay for it anyways
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
because these companies are going to
 
05:41:29.208 --> 05:41:29.218 align:start position:0%
have to go get alternate compliance
 
05:41:31.310 --> 05:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
payments but in this case there simply
 
05:41:33.170 --> 05:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
isn't a need to do that we have a
 
05:41:34.368 --> 05:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
mechanism where people can choose
 
05:41:36.410 --> 05:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
themselves and if enough people want to
 
05:41:38.930 --> 05:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
have uh solar or wind or whatever type
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy then that energy
 
05:41:42.288 --> 05:41:42.298 align:start position:0%
will flourish without additional
 
05:41:42.298 --> 05:41:44.570 align:start position:0%
will flourish without additional
subsidies

05:41:44.570 --> 05:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
subsidies
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh follow up but I'll remind members
 
05:41:48.170 --> 05:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
that we're not here to discuss
 
05:41:50.150 --> 05:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
philosophy we're here to ask questions
 
05:41:52.128 --> 05:41:52.138 align:start position:0%
about the specifics of the bill this
 
05:41:53.448 --> 05:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
would be a specific question about the
 
05:41:54.948 --> 05:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
mechanism that you're mentioning you say
 
05:41:56.390 --> 05:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
the mechanism is already in place but
 
05:41:57.770 --> 05:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
your bill would actually you know
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
basically gut it uh by by capping those
 
05:42:02.930 --> 05:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh those you know the percentage
 
05:42:06.050 --> 05:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
requirements uh under the RPS the
 
05:42:07.970 --> 05:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
mechanism is there for a reason and your
 
05:42:10.368 --> 05:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
bill would gut it so how can you then
 
05:42:12.830 --> 05:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
say that the bill you I think it
 
05:42:14.628 --> 05:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
confused the bill wouldn't got it at all
 
05:42:16.670 --> 05:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
but the requirement with the president
 
05:42:19.368 --> 05:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
with the law was is it said that you
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
could simply go to your default energy
 
05:42:22.670 --> 05:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
supplier which would be let's just say
 
05:42:24.230 --> 05:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
eversource for the sake of example and
 
05:42:26.990 --> 05:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
say I request that my electricity be 100
 
05:42:29.810 --> 05:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
renewable and then they would come back
 
05:42:32.208 --> 05:42:32.218 align:start position:0%
to you and say okay we can do that we're
 
05:42:33.770 --> 05:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
going to make sure we buy enough
 
05:42:35.810 --> 05:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
renewable energy to cover all the people
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
that request that and oh there's going
 
05:42:40.190 --> 05:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
to be an extra charge involved in it and
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with renewable
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard these numbers as
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
amended in my Bill wouldn't change
 
05:42:48.170 --> 05:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
whatsoever the eversource would still be
 
05:42:50.150 --> 05:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
required to get six percent of their
 
05:42:52.368 --> 05:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
electricity from class one Rex now some
 
05:42:54.288 --> 05:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
of that would go to cover those requests
 
05:42:56.330 --> 05:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
but if they had more requests than six
 
05:42:57.890 --> 05:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
percent they would simply have to buy
 
05:42:59.810 --> 05:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
more than six percent they couldn't buy
 
05:42:59.820 --> 05:43:02.990 align:start position:0%
more than six percent they couldn't buy
less

05:43:02.990 --> 05:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.910 --> 05:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions from the
 
05:43:07.610 --> 05:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
committee representative muns
 
05:43:10.190 --> 05:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um I'm sorry I
 
05:43:13.250 --> 05:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
missed the uh the conversation on HB 165
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
so you may have answered that at my
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
question at that time
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
um oh okay sorry
 
05:43:21.948 --> 05:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
um it was very short the um I guess I
 
05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
guess given everything that you that you
 
05:43:26.570 --> 05:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
were talking about why specifically
 
05:43:28.730 --> 05:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
eliminating class three
 
05:43:30.650 --> 05:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
well I didn't eliminate the class three
 
05:43:32.810 --> 05:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
I put it at one percent because maybe
 
05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's from part of the other uh the uh
 
05:43:37.850 --> 05:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
thing there's a it's already in statute
 
05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the department of energy has the
 
05:43:42.288 --> 05:43:42.298 align:start position:0%
authority to adjust the class III Rex
 
05:43:44.690 --> 05:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
requirement because we simply don't have
 
05:43:46.850 --> 05:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
enough power plants to produce the
 
05:43:48.650 --> 05:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
amount of power that was originally in
 
05:43:50.750 --> 05:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
there which is at the six percent level
 
05:43:52.670 --> 05:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
these are these are you have to remember
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
it's a very unusual rule because the
 
05:43:56.690 --> 05:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
power plant had to go online prior to
 
05:44:00.110 --> 05:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
nine 2006 I believe so if someone were
 
05:44:02.750 --> 05:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
to come up with some new super duper uh
 
05:44:05.470 --> 05:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
method of burning wood you could get 35
 
05:44:07.850 --> 05:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
thermal efficiency it still wouldn't
 
05:44:09.770 --> 05:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
replace the old clunker plants because
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
we're stuck having to buy Power for them
 
05:44:14.690 --> 05:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
from ever be like saying 10 of the
 
05:44:16.368 --> 05:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
computers bought by the state have to be
 
05:44:18.830 --> 05:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured before 2010. it really
 
05:44:21.170 --> 05:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't make much sense but the one
 
05:44:23.448 --> 05:44:23.458 align:start position:0%
percent there reflects what can be
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
produced and that was actually just
 
05:44:27.890 --> 05:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
reflects what was set by the doe because
 
05:44:30.048 --> 05:44:30.058 align:start position:0%
they have the flex ability to lower that
 
05:44:32.628 --> 05:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
when the amount of Supply goes down so
 
05:44:34.670 --> 05:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise you'd just be buying alternate
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
compliance payments
 
05:44:38.990 --> 05:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:44:41.690 --> 05:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
further questions representative closure
 
05:44:44.330 --> 05:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
and thank you chairman Bulls uh thank
 
05:44:46.910 --> 05:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington taking my
 
05:44:50.208 --> 05:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
question have you factored in
 
05:44:55.090 --> 05:44:55.100 align:start position:0%
the capital that businesses most most
 
05:44:58.490 --> 05:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
Municipal and hospitals have purchased
 
05:45:02.690 --> 05:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
wood boilers uh based on
 
05:45:05.930 --> 05:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
the wrecks they would get
 
05:45:08.330 --> 05:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
have I specifically done that no but I
 
05:45:10.610 --> 05:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
also would say the reason for this why
 
05:45:12.770 --> 05:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
this bill does doesn't take that into
 
05:45:14.750 --> 05:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
consideration is because that's a
 
05:45:16.910 --> 05:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
handout that's that's large yes from the
 
05:45:18.470 --> 05:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
government in the rate payers that they
 
05:45:20.330 --> 05:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
got they have no reason to believe that
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
that goes on forever any more than if I
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
started collecting unemployment and two
 
05:45:25.970 --> 05:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
years later the government said well
 
05:45:27.230 --> 05:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
sorry you can't collect it anymore
 
05:45:29.090 --> 05:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
because I'm counting on that money now
 
05:45:30.410 --> 05:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
you got to keep giving it me forever
 
05:45:32.570 --> 05:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing no one should count
 
05:45:34.610 --> 05:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
on getting a government grant that never
 
05:45:34.620 --> 05:45:38.208 align:start position:0%
on getting a government grant that never
ends

05:45:38.208 --> 05:45:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
additional questions for representative
 
05:45:41.040 --> 05:45:42.830 align:start position:0%
additional questions for representative
Harrington

05:45:42.830 --> 05:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
05:45:44.990 --> 05:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:45:46.970 --> 05:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
05:45:49.490 --> 05:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah I know that thing is always
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
right there
 
05:45:54.010 --> 05:45:54.020 align:start position:0%
um excuse me um online page one online
 
05:45:57.048 --> 05:45:57.058 align:start position:0%
15 16 17.
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
you reduce the the goal for class one
 
05:46:03.890 --> 05:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:03.900 --> 05:46:06.430 align:start position:0%
 
um significantly

05:46:06.430 --> 05:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
um significantly
 
05:46:09.470 --> 05:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
and you reduce class three to one
 
05:46:11.570 --> 05:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
percent and you leave class four at the
 
05:46:14.270 --> 05:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
same can you um can you explain why
 
05:46:16.190 --> 05:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
sure the easy one would be the class
 
05:46:17.930 --> 05:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
three because like I said that's already
 
05:46:20.208 --> 05:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
been set to one percent by the
 
05:46:21.530 --> 05:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
department of energy who has that
 
05:46:24.110 --> 05:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to match it with the
 
05:46:26.810 --> 05:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
demand upward Supply uh the other ones
 
05:46:30.708 --> 05:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
simply I it's it minimizes it when we
 
05:46:32.448 --> 05:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
say it limits the subsidy but it doesn't
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate it rather than going to 15 and
 
05:46:38.930 --> 05:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
and point seven percent it keeps its it
 
05:46:40.368 --> 05:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
puts it at six and point three which
 
05:46:42.890 --> 05:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
means existing facilities and new
 
05:46:44.510 --> 05:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
facilities will still get subsidies from
 
05:46:46.670 --> 05:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
the rate payers through Rex but they
 
05:46:48.770 --> 05:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
just won't get as bigger ones but at the
 
05:46:50.570 --> 05:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
same time if you're looking at new ones
 
05:46:52.910 --> 05:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
especially they will be eligible for
 
05:46:54.650 --> 05:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
part of these billions and billions of
 
05:46:55.788 --> 05:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
dollars coming from the federal
 
05:46:57.890 --> 05:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
government that should induce people to
 
05:46:59.628 --> 05:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
build all the Renewable Power we could
 
05:47:01.368 --> 05:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
possibly cite in New Hampshire
 
05:47:05.628 --> 05:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up excuse me thank you
 
05:47:07.490 --> 05:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
um so you you came to these numbers
 
05:47:11.150 --> 05:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
based on your opinion or was there any
 
05:47:13.610 --> 05:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
research well it was based on my opinion
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
obviously it's just I think that's
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
enough that certainly giving them this
 
05:47:20.570 --> 05:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
this continues the subsidy that we were
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
told if you remember I don't know how
 
05:47:23.570 --> 05:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
long you've been dealing with Renewable
 
05:47:25.910 --> 05:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
Power but we were told back when these
 
05:47:27.530 --> 05:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
things were proposed that this was just
 
05:47:30.048 --> 05:47:30.058 align:start position:0%
a bridge to get them over that initial
 
05:47:32.570 --> 05:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
thing so when when wind production get
 
05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
up into the thousands of megawatts they
 
05:47:36.830 --> 05:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need any subsidies anymore on
 
05:47:38.810 --> 05:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
the same with solar but of course once
 
05:47:40.190 --> 05:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
somebody gets a subsidy they never want
 
05:47:42.110 --> 05:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
to give it up this is just an attempt to
 
05:47:44.270 --> 05:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
limit that it doesn't eliminate it it
 
05:47:48.410 --> 05:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
just says this is enough thank you
 
05:47:50.448 --> 05:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
05:47:53.208 --> 05:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you Mr
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh representative Harrington
 
05:47:58.250 --> 05:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
oh I've been called worse don't worry
 
05:48:00.650 --> 05:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
I think we all have
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure I understand
 
05:48:06.110 --> 05:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
about uh the class three reduction to
 
05:48:08.810 --> 05:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
one percent you're saying that Doe
 
05:48:12.048 --> 05:48:12.058 align:start position:0%
already has set it to one percent yes in
 
05:48:12.058 --> 05:48:13.128 align:start position:0%
already has set it to one percent yes in
20

05:48:13.128 --> 05:48:13.138 align:start position:0%
20
 
05:48:16.670 --> 05:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
20 and we're jumping if I'm wrong 2020
 
05:48:19.070 --> 05:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
in 2021 they were given the statutory
 
05:48:21.770 --> 05:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
Authority because it was there's a group
 
05:48:23.448 --> 05:48:23.458 align:start position:0%
of I can't remember the original number
 
05:48:25.910 --> 05:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
it was like six or seven small plants
 
05:48:28.010 --> 05:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
they're all under 25 megawatts they all
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
went online prior to uh 2006. those were
 
05:48:32.930 --> 05:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
the ones that were covered under class
 
05:48:35.330 --> 05:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
three and I think all but one of them is
 
05:48:38.330 --> 05:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
closed so we basically there was a law
 
05:48:42.010 --> 05:48:42.020 align:start position:0%
was passed that allowed the puc doe now
 
05:48:45.948 --> 05:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
to move that uh requirement down simply
 
05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
because there wasn't enough Supply
 
05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
because the plants didn't exist anymore
 
05:48:50.750 --> 05:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:48:53.810 --> 05:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
follow up so
 
05:48:56.330 --> 05:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
I mean you say that's in statute but
 
05:48:58.250 --> 05:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that statute be in Conflict
 
05:49:04.190 --> 05:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
then with uh 362 F 3 which says eight
 
05:49:04.200 --> 05:49:05.750 align:start position:0%
then with uh 362 F 3 which says eight
percent

05:49:05.750 --> 05:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:49:08.930 --> 05:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
well I'm changing okay it's it's in two
 
05:49:11.090 --> 05:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
places the statute allows them the
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
authority to make the change which
 
05:49:15.110 --> 05:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
they've already done and I'm simply
 
05:49:17.868 --> 05:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
matching in this to go along with the
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
with what they've already said at one
 
05:49:19.440 --> 05:49:21.410 align:start position:0%
with what they've already said at one
percent

05:49:21.410 --> 05:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:49:23.030 --> 05:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
they still would have the authority to
 
05:49:25.448 --> 05:49:25.458 align:start position:0%
adjust that
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
no not this one the other Statue I don't
 
05:49:31.490 --> 05:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
have the number off the top of my head
 
05:49:32.990 --> 05:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's how they made it one
 
05:49:33.000 --> 05:49:37.610 align:start position:0%
that's that's how they made it one
percent

05:49:37.610 --> 05:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions thank
 
05:49:39.718 --> 05:49:40.610 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions thank
you

05:49:40.610 --> 05:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:49:42.530 --> 05:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington I'd
 
05:49:44.930 --> 05:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
like like excuse me I think there was a
 
05:49:46.788 --> 05:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
question over here oh
 
05:49:48.650 --> 05:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative brezhny has a question
 
05:49:50.510 --> 05:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
um this was a follow-up from a previous
 
05:49:54.850 --> 05:49:54.860 align:start position:0%
question about where the number six
 
05:49:57.288 --> 05:49:57.298 align:start position:0%
percent and point three percent for
 
05:49:59.330 --> 05:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
class 1 and Class 2 came from and I
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
believe representative Harrington said
 
05:50:03.350 --> 05:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
that it was from his opinion uh I just
 
05:50:05.448 --> 05:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify are you it is you
 
05:50:07.368 --> 05:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
these numbers came
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
um because their continuation of 2015
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
right yeah that's not correct number as
 
05:50:17.690 --> 05:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:20.270 --> 05:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further hands raised no
 
05:50:22.970 --> 05:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
further questions I'd like next to call
 
05:50:25.070 --> 05:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
to the front of the room
 
05:50:25.080 --> 05:50:26.448 align:start position:0%
to the front of the room
our

05:50:26.448 --> 05:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:50:26.458 --> 05:50:31.788 align:start position:0%
our
yes

05:50:31.788 --> 05:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:34.010 --> 05:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
so everyone's clear that section three
 
05:50:35.750 --> 05:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill will be removed via
 
05:50:35.760 --> 05:50:37.010 align:start position:0%
of the bill will be removed via
Amendment

05:50:37.010 --> 05:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:50:38.750 --> 05:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay because that's not necessary
 
05:50:38.760 --> 05:50:40.730 align:start position:0%
okay because that's not necessary
anymore

05:50:40.730 --> 05:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:50:44.530 --> 05:50:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:46.970 --> 05:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh Griffin Robards from the Department
 
05:51:01.810 --> 05:51:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:04.548 --> 05:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh chairman Vos members of
 
05:51:06.470 --> 05:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
the committee again Griffin Roberge from
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
um the department is neutral on House
 
05:51:14.208 --> 05:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
Bill 166.
 
05:51:17.690 --> 05:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
um as introduced the bill makes three
 
05:51:19.548 --> 05:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
primary changes to the state's RPS
 
05:51:19.558 --> 05:51:21.070 align:start position:0%
primary changes to the state's RPS
policy

05:51:21.070 --> 05:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:51:25.368 --> 05:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
sections one two three and five remove
 
05:51:28.448 --> 05:51:28.458 align:start position:0%
references to useful thermal energy
 
05:51:32.090 --> 05:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
under the RPS that is a defined term in
 
05:51:34.030 --> 05:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
the RPS statute
 
05:51:37.788 --> 05:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
within class one of the RPS there is a
 
05:51:40.368 --> 05:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
subset called class 1 thermal for
 
05:51:44.030 --> 05:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
thermal Technologies so the removal of
 
05:51:46.368 --> 05:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
that language indicates that uh class
 
05:51:49.010 --> 05:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
one thermal will no longer be a subset
 
05:51:53.990 --> 05:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
of class 1 under the RPS sec section 2
 
05:51:56.208 --> 05:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
reduces the various obligations for
 
05:51:59.330 --> 05:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
class 1 classes one and two uh based on
 
05:52:02.090 --> 05:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
the look at the bill it appears to cap
 
05:52:07.010 --> 05:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
them at 2015 obligation levels and then
 
05:52:09.470 --> 05:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
class three's obligation is capped at
 
05:52:12.350 --> 05:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
the 2021 level that was arrived at by
 
05:52:13.548 --> 05:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
the department of energy when it's
 
05:52:16.010 --> 05:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
statutorily adjusted the classes
 
05:52:18.470 --> 05:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
obligation per the authority that we
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
have the repeal on lines 19 to 26 on
 
05:52:27.048 --> 05:52:27.058 align:start position:0%
page one eliminate language that allows
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
for obligation increases to those
 
05:52:33.650 --> 05:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
classes up to 20 up to the year 2025
 
05:52:36.350 --> 05:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
and then section three eliminates
 
05:52:38.330 --> 05:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
existing biomass facilities from
 
05:52:40.610 --> 05:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
eligibility in class three and makes it
 
05:52:43.368 --> 05:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
primarily an existing methane uh class
 
05:52:46.128 --> 05:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
uh under the RPS
 
05:52:48.890 --> 05:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
um just by a high level overview of
 
05:52:51.048 --> 05:52:51.058 align:start position:0%
these changes uh the removal of useful
 
05:52:53.690 --> 05:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
thermology from the RPS will will remove
 
05:52:56.030 --> 05:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
the need for electric suppliers to
 
05:53:00.048 --> 05:53:00.058 align:start position:0%
procure class 1 thermal Rex and also to
 
05:53:02.350 --> 05:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
make acps for that class
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
based on our analysis you know a change
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
like this will certainly make an impact
 
05:53:09.110 --> 05:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
to the low-grade wood Market here in New
 
05:53:12.110 --> 05:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as to the residential
 
05:53:13.990 --> 05:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
and Commercial
 
05:53:16.310 --> 05:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
residential and commercial industrial
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
rebate programs for wood pellet systems
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
operated by the department we do
 
05:53:23.690 --> 05:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that this will likely reduce
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
overall RPS compliance costs by an
 
05:53:29.930 --> 05:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
indeterminable amount the reduction of
 
05:53:32.990 --> 05:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
class obligations in class 2 will likely
 
05:53:34.548 --> 05:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
lower the amount of wrecks that electric
 
05:53:37.010 --> 05:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
suppliers need to get in classes one and
 
05:53:39.890 --> 05:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
two with the rate of the proposed
 
05:53:43.310 --> 05:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
reductions and the class one two credit
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism that we previously discussed
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning it is likely that
 
05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers will be able to meet
 
05:53:52.190 --> 05:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
this new RPS obligation under this bill
 
05:53:55.610 --> 05:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
at lower levels by purchasing Rex
 
05:53:57.890 --> 05:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
reducing the need for suppliers to make
 
05:54:00.530 --> 05:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
acps to the renewable energy fund
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
therefore again likely to result in
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
lower RPS compliance costs but also a
 
05:54:08.448 --> 05:54:08.458 align:start position:0%
subsequent reduction in renewable energy
 
05:54:11.170 --> 05:54:11.180 align:start position:0%
funding for rebates and grants as well
 
05:54:13.670 --> 05:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
and then the elimination of the existing
 
05:54:15.708 --> 05:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
biomass facilities from eligibility in
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
class three
 
05:54:19.310 --> 05:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
um will likely follow a similar policy
 
05:54:21.530 --> 05:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
path that's been uh kind of articulated
 
05:54:22.730 --> 05:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
in other states in the region like
 
05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut that are
 
05:54:27.048 --> 05:54:27.058 align:start position:0%
either trying to remove or phase out
 
05:54:27.058 --> 05:54:28.970 align:start position:0%
either trying to remove or phase out
biomass

05:54:28.970 --> 05:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
biomass
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
um resources from the renewable
 
05:54:32.510 --> 05:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards
 
05:54:34.610 --> 05:54:34.620 align:start position:0%
um as with the removal of this subset
 
05:54:37.310 --> 05:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
this class one thermal the removal of
 
05:54:39.230 --> 05:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
biomass from class three you know will
 
05:54:41.270 --> 05:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
likely impact low-grade wood markets
 
05:54:44.208 --> 05:54:44.218 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire as well again that
 
05:54:46.788 --> 05:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
class will only largely constitute
 
05:54:50.448 --> 05:54:50.458 align:start position:0%
existing my uh methane resources
 
05:54:52.368 --> 05:54:52.378 align:start position:0%
um and with that that really concludes
 
05:54:53.810 --> 05:54:53.820 align:start position:0%
my testimony I'm happy to take any
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions that folks might have thank
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
05:54:59.390 --> 05:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Roberts so do we have
 
05:55:03.410 --> 05:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
questions for the DOE
 
05:55:05.270 --> 05:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
05:55:07.730 --> 05:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you mentioned um
 
05:55:12.770 --> 05:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts and was it
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut are have um what what is it
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
they've done about
 
05:55:20.868 --> 05:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
um about biomass sure so thank you for
 
05:55:22.610 --> 05:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
the question so Massachusetts has
 
05:55:25.490 --> 05:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
undertaken the uh policy decision to
 
05:55:28.250 --> 05:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
remove uh it's my understanding remove
 
05:55:30.948 --> 05:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
or in some way make it more difficult
 
05:55:33.410 --> 05:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
for biomass facilities to qualify for
 
05:55:35.330 --> 05:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
their renewable portfolio standards so
 
05:55:37.850 --> 05:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for those resources
 
05:55:39.590 --> 05:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
to sell any wrecks that they generate
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
into the Massachusetts RPS market in
 
05:55:44.510 --> 05:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
terms of Connecticut it's my
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
understanding and talking with our
 
05:55:47.570 --> 05:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy division that
 
05:55:49.548 --> 05:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
Connecticut is looking at phasing out
 
05:55:52.670 --> 05:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
biomass uh resources from their State's
 
05:55:55.970 --> 05:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
RPS one of the leading things that we've
 
05:55:58.368 --> 05:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
seen in recent years is the rate by
 
05:55:58.378 --> 05:55:59.270 align:start position:0%
seen in recent years is the rate by
which

05:55:59.270 --> 05:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:56:02.030 --> 05:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
RPS States set their alternative
 
05:56:04.010 --> 05:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
compliance payments for biomass
 
05:56:05.570 --> 05:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
facilities and I'm going to try to
 
05:56:07.090 --> 05:56:07.100 align:start position:0%
unpack that a little bit so
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
Connecticut's is Connecticut's
 
05:56:11.150 --> 05:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment for class
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
3 is slightly higher than New
 
05:56:15.770 --> 05:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's is and because of that you
 
05:56:18.048 --> 05:56:18.058 align:start position:0%
see a lot of electric suppliers settling
 
05:56:21.230 --> 05:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
their class 3 or biomass wrecks in the
 
05:56:23.868 --> 05:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Market to satisfy that
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
obligation to prevent paying these
 
05:56:27.350 --> 05:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
higher cost acps
 
05:56:29.208 --> 05:56:29.218 align:start position:0%
and they are instead paying the lower
 
05:56:32.330 --> 05:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
cost acps here in New Hampshire so
 
05:56:32.340 --> 05:56:32.868 align:start position:0%
cost acps here in New Hampshire so
um

05:56:32.868 --> 05:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:34.610 --> 05:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's at least the leading cause that
 
05:56:34.620 --> 05:56:35.510 align:start position:0%
that's at least the leading cause that
you

05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:56:37.970 --> 05:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
as to why we're seeing a a recent
 
05:56:40.010 --> 05:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
increase in acps being made in class
 
05:56:42.048 --> 05:56:42.058 align:start position:0%
three here in New Hampshire
 
05:56:42.058 --> 05:56:42.770 align:start position:0%
three here in New Hampshire
um

05:56:42.770 --> 05:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:45.708 --> 05:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
I hope that made sense I'm sorry it's a
 
05:56:46.970 --> 05:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
lot to throw right yeah right yeah
 
05:56:49.070 --> 05:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
05:56:51.650 --> 05:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
so these changes in Massachusetts I
 
05:56:53.270 --> 05:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
guess those have happened the ones in
 
05:56:56.090 --> 05:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
Connecticut are pending it sounds like I
 
05:56:58.850 --> 05:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
believe so and I I again had a word out
 
05:57:00.650 --> 05:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
to our sustainable energy division but
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh some staffers have been out sick and
 
05:57:04.250 --> 05:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
so the response there so my question is
 
05:57:06.590 --> 05:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
are these in statute or are these more
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh regulatory thank you for the question
 
05:57:11.208 --> 05:57:11.218 align:start position:0%
so this is I guess the nature of the
 
05:57:13.788 --> 05:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
regional RPS Market is that every state
 
05:57:16.010 --> 05:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
determines their own respective RPS
 
05:57:18.590 --> 05:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
policies and any changes to those
 
05:57:20.448 --> 05:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
policies have an impact on the entire
 
05:57:23.208 --> 05:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
Regional RPS market so if Massachusetts
 
05:57:25.970 --> 05:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
decides biomass will not qualify for our
 
05:57:29.570 --> 05:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
RPS anymore then biomass facilities are
 
05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
comparable wrecks and that might be
 
05:57:33.650 --> 05:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
eligible in other states can no longer
 
05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
sell into Massachusetts anymore if
 
05:57:38.150 --> 05:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
Connecticut makes changes to its ACP
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
rate and it incentivizes biomass
 
05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
facilities to sell their wrecks there
 
05:57:44.208 --> 05:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
that has an impact to say New Hampshire
 
05:57:46.670 --> 05:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
where we're not getting the comparable
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
wrecks wrecks being settled here and
 
05:57:50.750 --> 05:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
acps are being made by electric
 
05:57:52.670 --> 05:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
suppliers so
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell different states and their
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
policy decisions have implications for
 
05:58:03.230 --> 05:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds asked a question
 
05:58:08.208 --> 05:58:08.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:58:11.150 --> 05:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
isn't there a large difference in the
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
combustion efficiency of biomass
 
05:58:18.470 --> 05:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
combustion for electricity generation in
 
05:58:20.868 --> 05:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
small plants like you were just talking
 
05:58:24.890 --> 05:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
about and the combustion efficiency that
 
05:58:24.900 --> 05:58:26.150 align:start position:0%
about and the combustion efficiency that
um

05:58:26.150 --> 05:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:29.390 --> 05:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:33.708 --> 05:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
for a um for a facility to qualify for
 
05:58:36.530 --> 05:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
thermal wrecks so if I could thank you
 
05:58:37.610 --> 05:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
for the question so if I could break it
 
05:58:38.750 --> 05:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
down a little further you're talking
 
05:58:41.628 --> 05:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
about I guess a larger biomass facility
 
05:58:43.610 --> 05:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
versus say a residential like wood
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
pellet boiler system you're talking
 
05:58:47.510 --> 05:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
about correct yes I'm talking about wood
 
05:58:50.150 --> 05:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
pellet boiler yep and New Hampshire is
 
05:58:52.190 --> 05:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
the only state that has thermal racks
 
05:58:52.200 --> 05:58:54.070 align:start position:0%
the only state that has thermal racks
correct

05:58:54.070 --> 05:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:58:58.368 --> 05:58:58.378 align:start position:0%
and the other kind of uh wrecks and RPS
 
05:59:00.048 --> 05:59:00.058 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is
 
05:59:03.288 --> 05:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
the combustion of wood in large electric
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
generating correct stations yep that's
 
05:59:07.548 --> 05:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
correct isn't there a large difference
 
05:59:09.470 --> 05:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
in combustion efficiency in those two
 
05:59:11.090 --> 05:59:11.100 align:start position:0%
facilities I would agree with that yes
 
05:59:14.030 --> 05:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
can you give us a sense I I would I
 
05:59:16.490 --> 05:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
would just agree with that in in I
 
05:59:19.010 --> 05:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't provide specific data to back
 
05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
that up I just know yeah I I I'd be
 
05:59:23.750 --> 05:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
reluctant to do that I I can certainly
 
05:59:25.010 --> 05:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
follow up with a sustainable energy
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
division here in our department but I
 
05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into the okay the
 
05:59:29.868 --> 05:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
numbers but I know that that in Broad
 
05:59:33.310 --> 05:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
Strokes is true okay thank you
 
05:59:35.448 --> 05:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
05:59:37.548 --> 05:59:37.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:59:39.110 --> 05:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
um I know your department is you know
 
05:59:41.090 --> 05:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
has an overarching concern with costs as
 
05:59:43.310 --> 05:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
you define costs and I don't want to
 
05:59:44.750 --> 05:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
debate that because that would Veer into
 
05:59:46.310 --> 05:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
philosophy and I'm not going to do that
 
05:59:46.320 --> 05:59:47.510 align:start position:0%
philosophy and I'm not going to do that
but

05:59:47.510 --> 05:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:59:50.810 --> 05:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
um I didn't I don't hear you uh give any
 
05:59:52.910 --> 05:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
analysis of the impact of this bill on
 
05:59:55.788 --> 05:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
the diversifying the diversity and the
 
05:59:58.570 --> 05:59:58.580 align:start position:0%
future diversity of Our Generation mix
 
06:00:01.010 --> 06:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering if you have any
 
06:00:03.410 --> 06:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
insight into whether this bill might
 
06:00:06.170 --> 06:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
impact on that diversity of generation
 
06:00:08.810 --> 06:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
mix going forward and how that might
 
06:00:12.048 --> 06:00:12.058 align:start position:0%
impact on costs sure and uh thank you
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the question so you know if you
 
06:00:15.770 --> 06:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
review the purpose statement that's in
 
06:00:17.750 --> 06:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
the RPS statute is that one of the
 
06:00:17.760 --> 06:00:19.190 align:start position:0%
the RPS statute is that one of the
leading

06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
leading
 
06:00:21.890 --> 06:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
legislative policy goals of the RPS is
 
06:00:24.470 --> 06:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
to encourage the diversification of
 
06:00:26.330 --> 06:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
energy sources here in the state the RPS
 
06:00:29.208 --> 06:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
is a policy to to do that
 
06:00:32.750 --> 06:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
um by lessening I guess uh the impact by
 
06:00:35.330 --> 06:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
lessening the obligations
 
06:00:37.970 --> 06:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
um for these uh various Technologies
 
06:00:40.150 --> 06:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
under the RPS
 
06:00:44.330 --> 06:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
does have the potential of
 
06:00:47.030 --> 06:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
I would say in two fronts is that
 
06:00:50.090 --> 06:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
it it could be taken as a way of maybe I
 
06:00:52.570 --> 06:00:52.580 align:start position:0%
I want disincentivizing or not
 
06:00:55.430 --> 06:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
incentivizing renewable energy resources
 
06:00:58.730 --> 06:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
for one but two could also uh
 
06:01:01.548 --> 06:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
introduce maybe a level of Market
 
06:01:03.230 --> 06:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
uncertainty as I was addressing
 
06:01:04.910 --> 06:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative corman's question you
 
06:01:07.010 --> 06:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
know as states make substantial changes
 
06:01:09.890 --> 06:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
to their RPS uh policies that can have a
 
06:01:11.510 --> 06:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
ha that can shape the regional RPS
 
06:01:14.750 --> 06:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:16.548 --> 06:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
so at the beginning of this hearing I
 
06:01:18.530 --> 06:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
asked you all to imagine that it lasted
 
06:01:20.090 --> 06:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
for a half an hour
 
06:01:22.368 --> 06:01:22.378 align:start position:0%
well half hour is gone and we still have
 
06:01:26.590 --> 06:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:28.910 --> 06:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
and yet we wash the car and now it's
 
06:01:30.530 --> 06:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
going to rain okay
 
06:01:34.070 --> 06:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
any more questions for Mr Roberts yes
 
06:01:36.170 --> 06:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
06:01:38.208 --> 06:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:01:41.090 --> 06:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
um do we have any idea what the actual
 
06:01:43.490 --> 06:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
percentages are of
 
06:01:45.708 --> 06:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
um total megawatts supplied
 
06:01:48.070 --> 06:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
by class
 
06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so the
 
06:01:54.110 --> 06:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
obligations or the percentages required
 
06:01:56.990 --> 06:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
to be Pro the required under States is
 
06:01:59.690 --> 06:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
spelled out in State Statute so
 
06:02:01.910 --> 06:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
um what was it I know the reference
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
references made earlier about the
 
06:02:05.330 --> 06:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
department exercising its authority to
 
06:02:07.850 --> 06:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
adjust the obligation for class three we
 
06:02:10.548 --> 06:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
also have that same object uh we also
 
06:02:12.048 --> 06:02:12.058 align:start position:0%
have that same Authority for class four
 
06:02:15.730 --> 06:02:15.740 align:start position:0%
which is existing Hydro as well based on
 
06:02:19.610 --> 06:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
2022 compliance year the total RPS
 
06:02:23.330 --> 06:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
compliance for all classes is 22.50
 
06:02:23.340 --> 06:02:25.490 align:start position:0%
compliance for all classes is 22.50
percent

06:02:25.490 --> 06:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:02:28.128 --> 06:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
um and I can certainly provide uh uh
 
06:02:29.930 --> 06:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
something on that from our website that
 
06:02:31.430 --> 06:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
kind of spells that out if you'd like I
 
06:02:33.110 --> 06:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
can go through each class but I realize
 
06:02:34.910 --> 06:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're running over time here and
 
06:02:34.920 --> 06:02:36.470 align:start position:0%
we're running over time here and
follow-up

06:02:36.470 --> 06:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:02:37.850 --> 06:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:02:39.708 --> 06:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
um it it would be great if you could
 
06:02:42.470 --> 06:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
break it out by class because it it it
 
06:02:45.230 --> 06:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
kind of begs the question that if the
 
06:02:47.090 --> 06:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
actual for example of class one is
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
already at 10 why would we go back to
 
06:02:52.128 --> 06:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
six I'll I'll run through it quite
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
quickly then thank you for the question
 
06:02:55.150 --> 06:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh class one
 
06:02:58.190 --> 06:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
just class one as a whole and this is
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
again based on calendar year 2022 is
 
06:03:03.948 --> 06:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
10.30 percent
 
06:03:09.170 --> 06:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:11.930 --> 06:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
and then the total class one obligation
 
06:03:16.010 --> 06:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
is at 12.30 so that's a combination of
 
06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
the 10.30 and the two percent
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
class two is at point seven zero percent
 
06:03:25.310 --> 06:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
class three is at eight percent
 
06:03:25.320 --> 06:03:27.230 align:start position:0%
class three is at eight percent
currently

06:03:27.230 --> 06:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:03:29.390 --> 06:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
class four is at one point five zero
 
06:03:29.400 --> 06:03:30.650 align:start position:0%
class four is at one point five zero
percent

06:03:30.650 --> 06:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:03:32.628 --> 06:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
and I can follow up with an email to the
 
06:03:33.830 --> 06:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee that spells that out further
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
that would be great thanks
 
06:03:39.410 --> 06:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for Mr
 
06:03:43.070 --> 06:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
Roberge we will now move on and call to
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
the all right front of the room Mr
 
06:03:47.690 --> 06:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
Michael O'Leary who represents
 
06:03:50.890 --> 06:03:50.900 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater power
 
06:03:56.390 --> 06:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:58.430 --> 06:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael O'Leary I'm
 
06:04:03.230 --> 06:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
the asset manager of Bridgewater Power
 
06:04:03.240 --> 06:04:04.548 align:start position:0%
the asset manager of Bridgewater Power
Company

06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
Company
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater is one of the uh five
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
remaining smaller biomass plants in the
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
state where 15 megawatt biomass plant
 
06:04:18.948 --> 06:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:18.958 --> 06:04:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:04:19.670 --> 06:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:21.830 --> 06:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
I've testified before the committee many
 
06:04:24.048 --> 06:04:24.058 align:start position:0%
times in the past and outlined the
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefits of biomass power
 
06:04:29.090 --> 06:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
such as jobs in the rural economy
 
06:04:32.570 --> 06:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
forestry benefits fuel diversity
 
06:04:35.750 --> 06:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
capacity and diversity benefits in ISO
 
06:04:36.830 --> 06:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
New England
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
Etc so I won't
 
06:04:40.368 --> 06:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
go into great detail on those but would
 
06:04:43.010 --> 06:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
be happy to try to answer questions if
 
06:04:45.770 --> 06:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
necessary Bridgewater employees
 
06:04:48.410 --> 06:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
20 people and we have a direct payroll
 
06:04:50.930 --> 06:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
and benefits of over 2.3 million dollars
 
06:04:53.090 --> 06:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
so it's pretty important in our little
 
06:04:55.250 --> 06:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
area of the state
 
06:04:57.830 --> 06:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
we purchase over five million dollars a
 
06:05:01.310 --> 06:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
year of wood fuel chips
 
06:05:03.530 --> 06:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
also quite important in our area of the
 
06:05:03.540 --> 06:05:04.788 align:start position:0%
also quite important in our area of the
state

06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:05:07.730 --> 06:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
to qualify for class III wrecks our
 
06:05:09.350 --> 06:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
facility has to meet air emissions
 
06:05:12.948 --> 06:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
requirements that a 66 percent below our
 
06:05:14.810 --> 06:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
permitted requirements
 
06:05:18.890 --> 06:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
so the RPS clearly has societal benefits
 
06:05:21.530 --> 06:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
of Clean Air
 
06:05:24.650 --> 06:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
we could be online producing at 66
 
06:05:28.070 --> 06:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
percent higher emissions
 
06:05:30.890 --> 06:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh to produce Rex as a cost to a power
 
06:05:33.708 --> 06:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
plant like Bridgewater first off we had
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
to put in Capital Equipment
 
06:05:38.750 --> 06:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
we have operating costs of over a half a
 
06:05:38.760 --> 06:05:40.070 align:start position:0%
we have operating costs of over a half a
megawatt

06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
06:05:42.410 --> 06:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
in parasitic load to run the fan
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
horsepower that's required to run the
 
06:05:48.948 --> 06:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
Catalyst we have ammonia expense
 
06:05:51.470 --> 06:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
to take our nox emission and turn it
 
06:05:54.650 --> 06:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
into the benign compounds of
 
06:05:57.730 --> 06:05:57.740 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and water
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
we've sold more than 90 percent of our
 
06:06:01.200 --> 06:06:02.810 align:start position:0%
we've sold more than 90 percent of our
wrecks

06:06:02.810 --> 06:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
06:06:04.430 --> 06:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
06:06:07.128 --> 06:06:07.138 align:start position:0%
so have borne no
 
06:06:10.250 --> 06:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
cost to New Hampshire rate payers and
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
all if you look at the bill and you look
 
06:06:14.690 --> 06:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
at uh some of the things that
 
06:06:15.890 --> 06:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has
 
06:06:17.750 --> 06:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
characterized they're simply not
 
06:06:17.760 --> 06:06:19.910 align:start position:0%
characterized they're simply not
accurate

06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
06:06:25.070 --> 06:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
the puc has the ability each year
 
06:06:26.750 --> 06:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
to lower
 
06:06:29.570 --> 06:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
the the RPS standard
 
06:06:31.910 --> 06:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have been quite transparent with the
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
puc last year as a matter of fact for
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
2022 I testified yes go ahead and lower
 
06:06:42.288 --> 06:06:42.298 align:start position:0%
the standard the requirement because we
 
06:06:44.868 --> 06:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
don't need the program we've sold them
 
06:06:47.750 --> 06:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
out of state you can reduce the ACP
 
06:06:51.110 --> 06:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
payments and we've done that repeatedly
 
06:06:54.288 --> 06:06:54.298 align:start position:0%
since 2007. that's why you've seen the
 
06:06:56.448 --> 06:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
requirement go down but we've always
 
06:06:59.990 --> 06:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
said we need the placeholder of the
 
06:07:02.208 --> 06:07:02.218 align:start position:0%
eight percent because there will become
 
06:07:05.628 --> 06:07:05.638 align:start position:0%
a day when we're going to be dependent
 
06:07:08.270 --> 06:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire class 3 wrecks
 
06:07:13.610 --> 06:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:15.590 --> 06:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
state of Connecticut
 
06:07:18.110 --> 06:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with pollution
 
06:07:20.510 --> 06:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
it has to do with being provincial
 
06:07:23.628 --> 06:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
and not wanting to send Connecticut rate
 
06:07:26.090 --> 06:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
payer dollars to New Hampshire
 
06:07:29.930 --> 06:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
so you can still qualify for renewable
 
06:07:32.570 --> 06:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
energy credits if you built a new
 
06:07:35.510 --> 06:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
biomass power plant in Connecticut
 
06:07:37.610 --> 06:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
but they're phasing out
 
06:07:40.190 --> 06:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
the older Legacy biomass plants because
 
06:07:42.590 --> 06:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't like the fact that all their
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
ratepayer dollars were going to New
 
06:07:46.010 --> 06:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and have and have come here
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
for many many years
 
06:07:50.990 --> 06:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
so in 20 this is the absolute wrong time
 
06:07:53.330 --> 06:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
to lower the standard from the eight
 
06:07:55.788 --> 06:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
percent to one percent
 
06:07:58.490 --> 06:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
in statute because the puc has the
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
authority they review it every year as
 
06:08:04.730 --> 06:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
as the gentleman from doe just said 2023
 
06:08:06.530 --> 06:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's at eight percent
 
06:08:09.170 --> 06:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
they haven't opened the docket yet to
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
determine what it will be they'll review
 
06:08:12.470 --> 06:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
the market
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
they'll evaluate how many megawatts are
 
06:08:17.810 --> 06:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
available in the market
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll ask for Testimony
 
06:08:21.590 --> 06:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
they'll ask for testimony from the
 
06:08:23.628 --> 06:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
utilities whether the utilities have
 
06:08:25.310 --> 06:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
been able to procure wrecks or not be
 
06:08:27.530 --> 06:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
able been able to procure Rex and then
 
06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
they'll make a determination and they've
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
and they've done that every year since
 
06:08:31.680 --> 06:08:34.910 align:start position:0%
and they've done that every year since
2007.

06:08:34.910 --> 06:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:34.920 --> 06:08:35.868 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:08:35.868 --> 06:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:38.628 --> 06:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the same way they're not
 
06:08:41.690 --> 06:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
it's not because of a pollution issue
 
06:08:43.670 --> 06:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's because of
 
06:08:46.910 --> 06:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
not wanting Massachusetts dollars to
 
06:08:49.250 --> 06:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
flow to New Hampshire
 
06:08:54.110 --> 06:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
EPA U.S EPA and the ipcc International
 
06:08:56.750 --> 06:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
Panel for climate change
 
06:08:59.448 --> 06:08:59.458 align:start position:0%
have both completely kind of
 
06:09:02.030 --> 06:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
unequivocally agreed that biogenic
 
06:09:04.548 --> 06:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
carbon is a completely different animal
 
06:09:06.470 --> 06:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
than fossil carbon
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
that they're looking they look at the
 
06:09:11.930 --> 06:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
two of the difference between 10 000
 
06:09:15.890 --> 06:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
plus years of tied up carbon versus a
 
06:09:18.230 --> 06:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
50-year type tied up carbon so it's that
 
06:09:21.048 --> 06:09:21.058 align:start position:0%
that's that's been clear science that
 
06:09:23.330 --> 06:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not a climate scientist and and
 
06:09:25.070 --> 06:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to debate that issue but it's
 
06:09:28.730 --> 06:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
I I think that we have the facts on on
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
that and it's been studied uh quite a
 
06:09:31.320 --> 06:09:33.770 align:start position:0%
that and it's been studied uh quite a
bit

06:09:33.770 --> 06:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:33.780 --> 06:09:36.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:39.410 --> 06:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
happy to really try to answer any other
 
06:09:39.420 --> 06:09:40.670 align:start position:0%
happy to really try to answer any other
questions

06:09:40.670 --> 06:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:09:43.190 --> 06:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
on the rec programs in the other state
 
06:09:46.368 --> 06:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
or on class three but but a plant like
 
06:09:49.250 --> 06:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater we we really have three
 
06:09:52.070 --> 06:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
revenue streams we sell energy the
 
06:09:54.470 --> 06:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
physical kilowatt hours we sell capacity
 
06:09:56.570 --> 06:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
and then we sell the renewable energy
 
06:09:59.330 --> 06:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
credits and without all three
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're out of business so we're dependent
 
06:10:04.850 --> 06:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
upon the New Hampshire class 3 Program
 
06:10:07.128 --> 06:10:07.138 align:start position:0%
um and it's I think it's been a very
 
06:10:08.750 --> 06:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
successful program
 
06:10:10.730 --> 06:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
and I think the plans have been a
 
06:10:13.610 --> 06:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:15.770 --> 06:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very enlightening testimony we
 
06:10:17.810 --> 06:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here to deliver it
 
06:10:21.170 --> 06:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
we have questions for Mr O'Leary from
 
06:10:25.850 --> 06:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
06:10:30.650 --> 06:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
and next call to the front of the
 
06:10:30.660 --> 06:10:31.970 align:start position:0%
and next call to the front of the

06:10:31.970 --> 06:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
building
 
06:10:34.548 --> 06:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
or to the table rather Mr Charlie
 
06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
nibbling who is representing himself
 
06:10:40.610 --> 06:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
he's from boscoin and someone who's
 
06:10:42.170 --> 06:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
testified before this Committee in the
 
06:10:43.868 --> 06:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
past welcome
 
06:10:46.670 --> 06:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr nibbling
 
06:10:46.680 --> 06:10:55.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr nibbling
foreign

06:10:55.810 --> 06:10:55.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:58.850 --> 06:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
members of the health science technology
 
06:11:00.708 --> 06:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
and energy committee
 
06:11:04.490 --> 06:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's uh a pleasure to come before you
 
06:11:06.530 --> 06:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
today to defend
 
06:11:09.530 --> 06:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
the importance of recognizing renewable
 
06:11:11.390 --> 06:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
thermal energy in the New Hampshire
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard
 
06:11:15.890 --> 06:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased once again to have this
 
06:11:15.900 --> 06:11:17.530 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased once again to have this
opportunity

06:11:17.530 --> 06:11:17.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
I've prepared some written testimony
 
06:11:23.150 --> 06:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
which I have have printed in in this
 
06:11:25.010 --> 06:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
distrib Distributing I'm not going to
 
06:11:27.470 --> 06:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
read it I will paraphrase
 
06:11:30.470 --> 06:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
a few items briefly and then I wanted to
 
06:11:33.350 --> 06:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
speak to representative Harrington's uh
 
06:11:35.030 --> 06:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
assertion that
 
06:11:35.040 --> 06:11:36.350 align:start position:0%
assertion that
uh

06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:11:39.048 --> 06:11:39.058 align:start position:0%
an electric RPS is no place to
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
incentivize renewable thermal energy and
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
06:11:44.868 --> 06:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
that representative Harrington is not
 
06:11:49.970 --> 06:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
here to to listen to my comments
 
06:11:49.980 --> 06:11:50.868 align:start position:0%
here to to listen to my comments
um

06:11:50.868 --> 06:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:53.810 --> 06:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
my history with thermal and the RPS goes
 
06:11:56.330 --> 06:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
back to 2006.
 
06:11:58.788 --> 06:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
when Governor Benson formed a study
 
06:12:01.730 --> 06:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
committee to evaluate the adoption of an
 
06:12:06.410 --> 06:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
RPS that led to House Bill 873 in 2007
 
06:12:10.010 --> 06:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
it was sent to interim study it was
 
06:12:12.470 --> 06:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
passed in 2008 and it became effective
 
06:12:14.990 --> 06:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
in 2009 with the adoption of Rules by
 
06:12:16.788 --> 06:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
06:12:19.490 --> 06:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
there was quite a bit of discussion at
 
06:12:21.770 --> 06:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
that time about a more fuel and
 
06:12:24.590 --> 06:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
Technology neutral renewable energy
 
06:12:26.930 --> 06:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
standard one that embraced both both
 
06:12:28.910 --> 06:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
electricity and thermal
 
06:12:31.250 --> 06:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
but the legislature stopped short of
 
06:12:34.010 --> 06:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
doing that with a couple notable
 
06:12:36.288 --> 06:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
exceptions one they made the renewable
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
energy fund Fuel and Technology neutral
 
06:12:42.350 --> 06:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
they made it possible for that fund to
 
06:12:44.948 --> 06:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
support renewable thermal Technologies
 
06:12:47.990 --> 06:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
two it's set in motion a study by the
 
06:12:49.730 --> 06:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission which was
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
completed in 2010 evaluating the
 
06:12:56.270 --> 06:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
efficacy of adding thermal to the RPS
 
06:12:59.750 --> 06:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that study was published and the
 
06:12:59.760 --> 06:13:00.788 align:start position:0%
that that study was published and the
puc

06:13:00.788 --> 06:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
puc
 
06:13:03.288 --> 06:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
stopped short of a recommendation but
 
06:13:06.048 --> 06:13:06.058 align:start position:0%
instead it said it's feasible that
 
06:13:07.970 --> 06:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
recommendation became codified and
 
06:13:11.628 --> 06:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 218 in 2012 which came
 
06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
before this committee chaired at the
 
06:13:15.948 --> 06:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
time by representative Jim Garrity
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
that was a time when both the House and
 
06:13:21.288 --> 06:13:21.298 align:start position:0%
Senate were under Republican leadership
 
06:13:25.070 --> 06:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
the house by uh speaker Bill O'Brien
 
06:13:29.510 --> 06:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
that bill passed the house 275 to 6.
 
06:13:32.810 --> 06:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
adding thermal to the RPS passed the
 
06:13:36.470 --> 06:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
Senate unanimously and became effective
 
06:13:39.650 --> 06:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
upon passage and ultimately with the
 
06:13:41.330 --> 06:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
adoption of rules
 
06:13:44.448 --> 06:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was the first state to add
 
06:13:47.330 --> 06:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
thermal to its RPS in a comprehensive
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
Fuel and Technology neutral manner
 
06:13:53.810 --> 06:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh since then 15 states have added
 
06:13:55.850 --> 06:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
thermal in one form or another to their
 
06:13:58.910 --> 06:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
RPS programs and to the question I
 
06:14:01.030 --> 06:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
believe that representative Summers
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
asked earlier while Massachusetts no
 
06:14:08.150 --> 06:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
longer recognizes biomass in its RPS it
 
06:14:10.010 --> 06:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
does in its alternative portfolio
 
06:14:12.250 --> 06:14:12.260 align:start position:0%
standard the aps
 
06:14:14.868 --> 06:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
recognizes biomass thermal
 
06:14:19.850 --> 06:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
making the policy decision to
 
06:14:25.910 --> 06:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
foreclose on future biomass electric
 
06:14:28.850 --> 06:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
generation has fully embraced thermal
 
06:14:28.860 --> 06:14:30.190 align:start position:0%
generation has fully embraced thermal
generation

06:14:30.190 --> 06:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
generation
 
06:14:34.150 --> 06:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
main added thermal to its RPS in 2019
 
06:14:37.010 --> 06:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
Vermont debated a clean heat standard
 
06:14:39.948 --> 06:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
last year that was ultimately vetoed by
 
06:14:42.730 --> 06:14:42.740 align:start position:0%
governor Scott but is coming back again
 
06:14:45.170 --> 06:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
uh apparently as a result of
 
06:14:46.970 --> 06:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
negotiations between the governor's
 
06:14:48.530 --> 06:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
office and the legislature and they're
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to take another run at it so yeah
 
06:14:54.770 --> 06:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
if you look to the south in New England
 
06:14:56.930 --> 06:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
where there essentially is no Forest
 
06:14:58.548 --> 06:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
products industry left
 
06:14:58.558 --> 06:14:59.810 align:start position:0%
products industry left
uh

06:14:59.810 --> 06:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:15:03.470 --> 06:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
they have taken steps to eliminate or
 
06:15:06.410 --> 06:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
reduce support for biomass energy but if
 
06:15:08.510 --> 06:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
you look to the north the East and the
 
06:15:11.330 --> 06:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
West they have fully embraced biomass
 
06:15:14.868 --> 06:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
energy in their RPS programs
 
06:15:14.878 --> 06:15:16.190 align:start position:0%
energy in their RPS programs
um

06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:20.030 --> 06:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
I I've cited some statistics here Mr
 
06:15:23.390 --> 06:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
chairman that are based on the 63
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
facilities that are thermal wreck
 
06:15:28.070 --> 06:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
eligible in the state since the the
 
06:15:31.250 --> 06:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
rules were adopted in 2014 I won't
 
06:15:32.628 --> 06:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
recite those
 
06:15:34.810 --> 06:15:34.820 align:start position:0%
and I did want to speak to
 
06:15:37.850 --> 06:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's question
 
06:15:42.410 --> 06:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
or assertion that an electric RPS that
 
06:15:45.530 --> 06:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate to have electric
 
06:15:47.150 --> 06:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
gray pairs
 
06:15:47.160 --> 06:15:48.788 align:start position:0%
gray pairs
um

06:15:48.788 --> 06:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:51.470 --> 06:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
incentivizing renewable thermal
 
06:15:51.480 --> 06:15:53.690 align:start position:0%
incentivizing renewable thermal
Technologies

06:15:53.690 --> 06:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
Technologies
 
06:15:55.910 --> 06:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are five responses to that
 
06:15:59.208 --> 06:15:59.218 align:start position:0%
question the first is thermal meets all
 
06:16:01.390 --> 06:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
of the public purposes of the RPS
 
06:16:04.548 --> 06:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
whether it's fuel diversity rural
 
06:16:07.310 --> 06:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
Economic Development emissions reduction
 
06:16:10.250 --> 06:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
it meets all of those objectives
 
06:16:13.610 --> 06:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
which is why the idea of a more fuel and
 
06:16:15.890 --> 06:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
Technology neutral
 
06:16:18.530 --> 06:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
energy policy is a good thing to to
 
06:16:18.540 --> 06:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
energy policy is a good thing to to
pursue

06:16:19.910 --> 06:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
06:16:22.430 --> 06:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
secondly it does so at significantly
 
06:16:23.948 --> 06:16:23.958 align:start position:0%
lower cost
 
06:16:27.170 --> 06:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
and it's important to note that I think
 
06:16:28.910 --> 06:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
the main reason
 
06:16:32.208 --> 06:16:32.218 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 218 passed in 2012 was
 
06:16:35.030 --> 06:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
because of the way the thermal provision
 
06:16:38.030 --> 06:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
was structured it was structured as a
 
06:16:40.850 --> 06:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
carve out of the pre-existing class one
 
06:16:44.030 --> 06:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
obligation it took a piece of the class
 
06:16:47.230 --> 06:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
1 electric obligation with an ACP of 55
 
06:16:51.288 --> 06:16:51.298 align:start position:0%
and it allocated it to Thermal at an ACP
 
06:16:57.350 --> 06:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
of 25 so by that single uh decision it
 
06:16:59.570 --> 06:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced the overall
 
06:17:02.810 --> 06:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
compliance uh cost of the RPS
 
06:17:05.030 --> 06:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's the only reason it
 
06:17:10.190 --> 06:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
passed in at that time given the uh uh
 
06:17:10.200 --> 06:17:11.270 align:start position:0%
passed in at that time given the uh uh
the

06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:17:13.310 --> 06:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
um perspective of those who are in
 
06:17:15.890 --> 06:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
charge of the legislature at the time
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
third uh it has the potential to
 
06:17:21.948 --> 06:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce demand for natural
 
06:17:24.230 --> 06:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
gas in the winter time if people switch
 
06:17:27.830 --> 06:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
from natural gas to a renewable thermal
 
06:17:30.530 --> 06:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
technology that takes pressure albeit
 
06:17:30.540 --> 06:17:31.548 align:start position:0%
technology that takes pressure albeit
small

06:17:31.548 --> 06:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
small
 
06:17:34.190 --> 06:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
off demand for natural gas during those
 
06:17:37.548 --> 06:17:37.558 align:start position:0%
periods in the winter time when you have
 
06:17:40.490 --> 06:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
constrained demand and you see Peak
 
06:17:43.390 --> 06:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
pricing for natural gas
 
06:17:43.400 --> 06:17:45.288 align:start position:0%
pricing for natural gas
fourth

06:17:45.288 --> 06:17:45.298 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
06:17:47.810 --> 06:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
all electric rate pairs are heat
 
06:17:50.868 --> 06:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
consumers all electric repairs have the
 
06:17:53.330 --> 06:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
potential directly or indirectly to
 
06:17:56.448 --> 06:17:56.458 align:start position:0%
benefit from the thermal provisions of
 
06:18:01.368 --> 06:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
the RPS and fifth uh and I've stated
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
this and I'll state it again it's helped
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
to move energy policy in the state
 
06:18:07.548 --> 06:18:07.558 align:start position:0%
toward a more fuel and Technology
 
06:18:09.410 --> 06:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
neutral platform
 
06:18:12.890 --> 06:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh we we consume roughly a third of all
 
06:18:14.868 --> 06:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
energy consumed in this in the state is
 
06:18:14.878 --> 06:18:15.948 align:start position:0%
energy consumed in this in the state is
heat

06:18:15.948 --> 06:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
heat
 
06:18:18.288 --> 06:18:18.298 align:start position:0%
roughly a third electricity roughly a
 
06:18:20.830 --> 06:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
third transportation
 
06:18:25.490 --> 06:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
so by this decision to add thermal we
 
06:18:29.090 --> 06:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
we created a policy that Embraces
 
06:18:31.610 --> 06:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the energy consumption in
 
06:18:33.948 --> 06:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
the state directly or indirectly
 
06:18:35.990 --> 06:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's it Mr chairman I'd be happy to
 
06:18:37.548 --> 06:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
06:18:37.558 --> 06:18:39.048 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
um

06:18:39.048 --> 06:18:39.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:42.890 --> 06:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh historical or or based on current
 
06:18:42.900 --> 06:18:44.030 align:start position:0%
uh historical or or based on current
practice

06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
practice
 
06:18:47.390 --> 06:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the committee to vote
 
06:18:49.368 --> 06:18:49.378 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to legislate
 
06:18:51.048 --> 06:18:51.058 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very Illuminating testimony we
 
06:18:56.350 --> 06:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here and offering
 
06:19:00.170 --> 06:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
both your historical and Industry
 
06:19:01.690 --> 06:19:01.700 align:start position:0%
perspective on this question
 
06:19:04.250 --> 06:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:19:07.128 --> 06:19:07.138 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chair
 
06:19:10.010 --> 06:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
um this list of business of um accounts
 
06:19:11.628 --> 06:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
I should say or
 
06:19:13.910 --> 06:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
um projects that that are thermal
 
06:19:16.368 --> 06:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
projects if they lost the ability to get
 
06:19:18.770 --> 06:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
wrecks how would that um affect them
 
06:19:18.780 --> 06:19:21.230 align:start position:0%
wrecks how would that um affect them
financially

06:19:21.230 --> 06:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
financially
 
06:19:25.128 --> 06:19:25.138 align:start position:0%
well uh Rex are trading for somewhere
 
06:19:28.010 --> 06:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 25 a megawatt hour
 
06:19:29.510 --> 06:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
thermal Rex
 
06:19:31.850 --> 06:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
so depending on the number of wrecks
 
06:19:33.948 --> 06:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
that they generate and
 
06:19:36.470 --> 06:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
and are authorized to sell
 
06:19:38.470 --> 06:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
06:19:43.430 --> 06:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh qualified buyers that represents in
 
06:19:45.170 --> 06:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
some cases very significant revenue
 
06:19:47.208 --> 06:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
streams to those
 
06:19:50.390 --> 06:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
those generators and to varying degrees
 
06:19:54.048 --> 06:19:54.058 align:start position:0%
they made Investments contingent on the
 
06:19:55.910 --> 06:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
expectation that those revenues would
 
06:19:58.250 --> 06:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
continue either to pay down Debt Service
 
06:20:00.770 --> 06:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
on the capital cost of their
 
06:20:03.110 --> 06:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
installation or to reduce their
 
06:20:04.788 --> 06:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
operating costs
 
06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for moving that
 
06:20:06.840 --> 06:20:09.470 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for moving that
um speaker

06:20:09.470 --> 06:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
um speaker
 
06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
06:20:14.810 --> 06:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman my question
 
06:20:17.510 --> 06:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
was along the same lines I guess I just
 
06:20:20.570 --> 06:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
would ask you instead of repeating um
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
exactly the same question
 
06:20:25.070 --> 06:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um to comment on the list you've given
 
06:20:27.890 --> 06:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
us a list of current
 
06:20:27.900 --> 06:20:28.788 align:start position:0%
us a list of current
um

06:20:28.788 --> 06:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:32.270 --> 06:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
facilities current institutions that
 
06:20:34.990 --> 06:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
have biomass boilers
 
06:20:37.490 --> 06:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
actually a number of them are geothermal
 
06:20:40.670 --> 06:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
systems as well okay okay
 
06:20:41.830 --> 06:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
um it
 
06:20:44.208 --> 06:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
surveying the list it appears that the
 
06:20:47.090 --> 06:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of them are public
 
06:20:49.868 --> 06:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
sector institutions of some sort schools
 
06:20:53.570 --> 06:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
counties municipalities
 
06:20:53.580 --> 06:20:54.890 align:start position:0%
counties municipalities
um

06:20:54.890 --> 06:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:57.650 --> 06:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
is there a reason for that and and like
 
06:20:59.628 --> 06:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
is there a phenomenon this is a
 
06:21:02.330 --> 06:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measure for well those are
 
06:21:03.948 --> 06:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
when you say public their
 
06:21:06.048 --> 06:21:06.058 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded entities and
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded entities have a a duty
 
06:21:10.190 --> 06:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
to their
 
06:21:13.310 --> 06:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
residents and taxpayers to make prudent
 
06:21:15.288 --> 06:21:15.298 align:start position:0%
financial decisions about long-term
 
06:21:17.868 --> 06:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
costs that are ultimately borne by
 
06:21:20.750 --> 06:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers heating is is a significant
 
06:21:23.390 --> 06:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
expense for a public school system
 
06:21:26.750 --> 06:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh County Nursing Home facility a rural
 
06:21:29.330 --> 06:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
non-profit Hospital
 
06:21:29.340 --> 06:21:30.470 align:start position:0%
non-profit Hospital
um

06:21:30.470 --> 06:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:32.750 --> 06:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
they're in a better position I think in
 
06:21:35.208 --> 06:21:35.218 align:start position:0%
many cases to make significant Capital
 
06:21:37.010 --> 06:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
Investments knowing that they will
 
06:21:39.830 --> 06:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
realize a return on that investment say
 
06:21:43.010 --> 06:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
after 8 10 12 14 years
 
06:21:45.830 --> 06:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
businesses on the other hand need a more
 
06:21:47.570 --> 06:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
immediate return on investment to
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
justify capital investment
 
06:21:54.530 --> 06:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
so projects that that don't uh
 
06:21:57.288 --> 06:21:57.298 align:start position:0%
generate simple paybacks of three to
 
06:21:59.448 --> 06:21:59.458 align:start position:0%
five years usually are not considered by
 
06:21:59.458 --> 06:22:02.090 align:start position:0%
five years usually are not considered by
businesses

06:22:02.090 --> 06:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:04.610 --> 06:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:22:07.310 --> 06:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh I would remind members to turn your
 
06:22:08.510 --> 06:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
microphone off when you're finished
 
06:22:11.750 --> 06:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
speaking uh representative Summers has a
 
06:22:11.760 --> 06:22:13.250 align:start position:0%
speaking uh representative Summers has a
question

06:22:13.250 --> 06:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:22:15.048 --> 06:22:15.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:22:16.670 --> 06:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
clarifying the question I asked earlier
 
06:22:18.288 --> 06:22:18.298 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
06:22:20.090 --> 06:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
um one question I have is uh
 
06:22:23.150 --> 06:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
in this bill about subsidies now granted
 
06:22:24.830 --> 06:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
we all know subsidies are not supposed
 
06:22:28.128 --> 06:22:28.138 align:start position:0%
to last forever and so with the goal in
 
06:22:31.010 --> 06:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
mind of uh is there a revenue point or
 
06:22:32.448 --> 06:22:32.458 align:start position:0%
something you shouldn't afford to where
 
06:22:35.330 --> 06:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
you would not or where would not there
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
would need to have subsidies would no
 
06:22:39.530 --> 06:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
longer have to exist
 
06:22:39.540 --> 06:22:40.970 align:start position:0%
longer have to exist
well

06:22:40.970 --> 06:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:22:44.208 --> 06:22:44.218 align:start position:0%
um the thermal provision actually
 
06:22:47.448 --> 06:22:47.458 align:start position:0%
plateaus out into the plateaued out in
 
06:22:47.458 --> 06:22:49.190 align:start position:0%
plateaus out into the plateaued out in
2022

06:22:49.190 --> 06:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
2022
 
06:22:53.390 --> 06:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
so the thermal carve out subclass if you
 
06:22:57.350 --> 06:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
will no longer grows after 2022
 
06:23:00.830 --> 06:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
if additional projects are seeking to
 
06:23:02.930 --> 06:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
qualify their systems for thermal racks
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
eventually the supply of wrecks will
 
06:23:07.910 --> 06:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
exceed what the statute requires the
 
06:23:10.610 --> 06:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
utilities and competitive suppliers to
 
06:23:13.548 --> 06:23:13.558 align:start position:0%
purchase Supply will exceed demand
 
06:23:15.650 --> 06:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
prices of wrecks will come down
 
06:23:15.660 --> 06:23:17.030 align:start position:0%
prices of wrecks will come down
significantly

06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's structured now and
 
06:23:22.490 --> 06:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
that was intentional I believe when
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 218 was passed it doesn't
 
06:23:27.350 --> 06:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
last forever it plateaus out
 
06:23:30.470 --> 06:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
and as Supply continues to grow over
 
06:23:33.650 --> 06:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
time eventually Rec values will come
 
06:23:36.110 --> 06:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
down and the incentive value of that
 
06:23:41.448 --> 06:23:41.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:43.750 --> 06:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative cloje has a question
 
06:23:47.270 --> 06:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman fols and thank you
 
06:23:49.910 --> 06:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I've seen the
 
06:23:52.970 --> 06:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
list here of thermal how many
 
06:23:52.980 --> 06:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
list here of thermal how many
operational

06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
operational
 
06:23:57.470 --> 06:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
plants are
 
06:23:58.788 --> 06:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
06:24:02.270 --> 06:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
how many plants were operational
 
06:24:05.330 --> 06:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
for electrical generation I realized
 
06:24:07.970 --> 06:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
Springfield Ashland and Bethlehem Tam
 
06:24:10.610 --> 06:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
were I might not know them all but I
 
06:24:13.368 --> 06:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
believe only two are producing
 
06:24:16.010 --> 06:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
um a generation of electricity by
 
06:24:18.470 --> 06:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
thermal I believe that's correct a
 
06:24:21.170 --> 06:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater which Mr O'Leary spoke to
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
and the Burgess plant in Berlin are
 
06:24:26.030 --> 06:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
still operational those are that's
 
06:24:28.670 --> 06:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
electric generation not not thermal
 
06:24:28.680 --> 06:24:30.430 align:start position:0%
electric generation not not thermal
follow-up

06:24:30.430 --> 06:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:24:33.770 --> 06:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Bulls uh follow up
 
06:24:35.510 --> 06:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
the other ones that I mentioned is
 
06:24:36.650 --> 06:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
probably more
 
06:24:40.310 --> 06:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned cost it's cheaper to use
 
06:24:40.320 --> 06:24:41.868 align:start position:0%
you mentioned cost it's cheaper to use
thermal

06:24:41.868 --> 06:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
thermal
 
06:24:41.878 --> 06:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
thermal
but

06:24:43.010 --> 06:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:24:46.010 --> 06:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
producing electricity
 
06:24:49.730 --> 06:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
your is it cheaper I'd like to know than
 
06:24:52.208 --> 06:24:52.218 align:start position:0%
other sources
 
06:24:54.830 --> 06:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
other sources being other renew
 
06:24:58.548 --> 06:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources or
 
06:25:00.530 --> 06:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
go ahead and explain
 
06:25:05.090 --> 06:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
that's thank you uh I my apologies of
 
06:25:08.810 --> 06:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
other fields natural gas oil okay um
 
06:25:11.810 --> 06:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
for making electricity
 
06:25:14.930 --> 06:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to defer to either Mr stock
 
06:25:17.510 --> 06:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
or perhaps you'd invite Mr O'Leary back
 
06:25:24.650 --> 06:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:26.448 --> 06:25:26.458 align:start position:0%
okay so you know further questions I
 
06:25:27.650 --> 06:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for thank you Mr
 
06:25:29.690 --> 06:25:29.700 align:start position:0%

06:25:37.368 --> 06:25:37.378 align:start position:0%
waiting a long time
 
06:25:39.110 --> 06:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
came here to testify on the previous
 
06:25:39.120 --> 06:25:40.910 align:start position:0%

06:25:48.830 --> 06:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
we've made him earn his salary today I
 
06:25:48.840 --> 06:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
we've made him earn his salary today I
think

06:26:00.900 --> 06:26:00.910 align:start position:0%

06:26:22.910 --> 06:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
I put three minutes but that was for two
 
06:26:25.310 --> 06:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
bills so we have one minute we have one
 
06:26:27.048 --> 06:26:27.058 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm going to try to do it in a
 
06:26:28.670 --> 06:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
minute and a half
 
06:26:30.590 --> 06:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Jason stock
 
06:26:32.090 --> 06:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the New
 
06:26:34.490 --> 06:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
06:26:36.830 --> 06:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
we represent the state's Timberland
 
06:26:40.670 --> 06:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
owners and the forest products industry
 
06:26:43.368 --> 06:26:43.378 align:start position:0%
um our members owner manage about a
 
06:26:46.010 --> 06:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
million acres of land across the state
 
06:26:48.948 --> 06:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
we have just over a thousand members in
 
06:26:50.930 --> 06:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
our membership and it's the entire food
 
06:26:50.940 --> 06:26:52.490 align:start position:0%
our membership and it's the entire food
chain

06:26:52.490 --> 06:26:52.500 align:start position:0%

um

06:26:53.208 --> 06:26:53.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:56.628 --> 06:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
and I've come today in opposition to in
 
06:26:58.310 --> 06:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
06:27:02.090 --> 06:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to explain to you briefly
 
06:27:04.910 --> 06:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
kind of the Nexus between
 
06:27:07.250 --> 06:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
utility policy and natural resource
 
06:27:09.170 --> 06:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
management policy and I also wanted to
 
06:27:11.930 --> 06:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about carbon and and
 
06:27:13.610 --> 06:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
as it relates there's been some
 
06:27:16.128 --> 06:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
questions about carbon and as it relates
 
06:27:19.970 --> 06:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
to biomass and biomass constr combustion
 
06:27:19.980 --> 06:27:22.310 align:start position:0%
to biomass and biomass constr combustion
um

06:27:22.310 --> 06:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:25.190 --> 06:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
in your packet you have a copy of our
 
06:27:29.208 --> 06:27:29.218 align:start position:0%
our latest magazine which which timing
 
06:27:31.368 --> 06:27:31.378 align:start position:0%
is everything actually this Edition is
 
06:27:34.190 --> 06:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated to carbon and in in climate
 
06:27:37.250 --> 06:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
change and and uh use of forest and
 
06:27:40.670 --> 06:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
carbon markets Etc so I wanted to
 
06:27:42.288 --> 06:27:42.298 align:start position:0%
provide you a copy of that that also
 
06:27:44.990 --> 06:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
gives you an idea of who we are
 
06:27:47.510 --> 06:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I also included in the packet a UNH
 
06:27:49.190 --> 06:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
this is just the executive summary
 
06:27:50.930 --> 06:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
Forest products industry economic
 
06:27:50.940 --> 06:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
Forest products industry economic
contribution

06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
06:27:54.048 --> 06:27:54.058 align:start position:0%
States Forest Products Industries about
 
06:27:56.810 --> 06:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
2.5 billion dollars
 
06:28:00.410 --> 06:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
um and that's all sectors of which
 
06:28:02.930 --> 06:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
biomass is a part of
 
06:28:02.940 --> 06:28:03.650 align:start position:0%
biomass is a part of
um

06:28:03.650 --> 06:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:03.660 --> 06:28:04.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:28:04.910 --> 06:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:07.610 --> 06:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
across the state you have a and you have
 
06:28:09.470 --> 06:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
a copy of this also
 
06:28:11.810 --> 06:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
they're about two thousand two hundred
 
06:28:13.610 --> 06:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
and twenty six Timber sales occurred
 
06:28:15.890 --> 06:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
across the entire State according to the
 
06:28:17.690 --> 06:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
last Timber tax data for the last tax
 
06:28:20.150 --> 06:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
year in every County and almost every
 
06:28:22.730 --> 06:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
town and what I want to point out is
 
06:28:24.530 --> 06:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
that about two-thirds when you look at
 
06:28:25.970 --> 06:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
Forest Service survey data about
 
06:28:27.170 --> 06:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of all the wood that's
 
06:28:29.030 --> 06:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
growing on our landscape is considered
 
06:28:31.548 --> 06:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
low grade this is wood that cannot be
 
06:28:35.868 --> 06:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
converted in or sown into a into a it's
 
06:28:39.650 --> 06:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
a two by four or piece of wood for for a
 
06:28:42.350 --> 06:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
desk and so for for landowners and land
 
06:28:44.628 --> 06:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
managers the ability to manage their
 
06:28:46.548 --> 06:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
property it's just like your garden you
 
06:28:48.350 --> 06:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
need a plate you need to do that weeding
 
06:28:50.390 --> 06:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
and thinning you need a market for
 
06:28:52.368 --> 06:28:52.378 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood biomass has been
 
06:28:54.590 --> 06:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
historically a part of that market for
 
06:28:56.510 --> 06:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
our state
 
06:28:59.510 --> 06:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and it's been a very important part
 
06:29:01.610 --> 06:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
um we have currently two power plants
 
06:29:04.368 --> 06:29:04.378 align:start position:0%
running as you heard earlier uh Burgess
 
06:29:06.890 --> 06:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
and Bridgewater there were four that
 
06:29:08.750 --> 06:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
were idle they've just come out of
 
06:29:08.760 --> 06:29:10.430 align:start position:0%
were idle they've just come out of
bankruptcy

06:29:10.430 --> 06:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy
 
06:29:12.350 --> 06:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
um and they are starting up running one
 
06:29:14.390 --> 06:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
is in Springfield and one is in
 
06:29:17.090 --> 06:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
Whitefield why I mentioned this is that
 
06:29:18.708 --> 06:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
percentage when we look at that eight
 
06:29:21.530 --> 06:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
percent why this is important
 
06:29:24.410 --> 06:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
the puc and the doe have the discretion
 
06:29:27.590 --> 06:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
to to modify that percentage as plants
 
06:29:30.590 --> 06:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
come and go offline as they sell wrecks
 
06:29:33.708 --> 06:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
out of the state we have this I'll call
 
06:29:36.170 --> 06:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
it a a safety valve that allows them to
 
06:29:40.190 --> 06:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
modify the the class III obligation and
 
06:29:41.990 --> 06:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that's built that's already baked
 
06:29:45.230 --> 06:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
into law and so just to reduce it to one
 
06:29:47.628 --> 06:29:47.638 align:start position:0%
percent removes that flexibility as a
 
06:29:50.270 --> 06:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
power plant comes on or as as you heard
 
06:29:53.270 --> 06:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
earlier is a power plant says all right
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the market I need to I
 
06:29:58.250 --> 06:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
need to be participating in
 
06:29:58.260 --> 06:29:59.690 align:start position:0%
need to be participating in
oh

06:29:59.690 --> 06:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:30:02.628 --> 06:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
the other piece of this uh these power
 
06:30:04.490 --> 06:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
plants they burn wood chips a number of
 
06:30:06.650 --> 06:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
you toured the Bridgewater plant earlier
 
06:30:08.030 --> 06:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
06:30:10.610 --> 06:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
you'll see chips come in from across the
 
06:30:13.490 --> 06:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
state also our Sawmill industry when you
 
06:30:15.410 --> 06:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
take a round log and you make it Square
 
06:30:18.350 --> 06:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
Lumber those slabs get chipped
 
06:30:22.970 --> 06:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
as does the bark that is those those
 
06:30:25.430 --> 06:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
products need a home a typical eastern
 
06:30:27.430 --> 06:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
white pine Mill can produce up to 11
 
06:30:30.170 --> 06:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
tractor-trailer loads of these chips
 
06:30:33.830 --> 06:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
and biomass plants have been a very very
 
06:30:36.830 --> 06:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
good Market to to manage that manage
 
06:30:39.530 --> 06:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
that Mill waste if I can just interrupt
 
06:30:42.770 --> 06:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
you for one second for anyone who's here
 
06:30:45.410 --> 06:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
to hear House Bill 81 which was
 
06:30:48.530 --> 06:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be heard at eight at 3 30.
 
06:30:50.868 --> 06:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
we will start that public Hearing in
 
06:30:53.570 --> 06:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
about 10 maybe 15 minutes as soon as we
 
06:30:56.868 --> 06:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
finish this one thank you
 
06:30:56.878 --> 06:30:58.330 align:start position:0%
finish this one thank you
so

06:30:58.330 --> 06:30:58.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:00.170 --> 06:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
may I
 
06:31:02.270 --> 06:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
oh so so
 
06:31:05.090 --> 06:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I just in all the details
 
06:31:07.190 --> 06:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
are in our Our Testimony all the numbers
 
06:31:10.430 --> 06:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
all the statistics it's a these plants
 
06:31:13.310 --> 06:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
are important the thermal creates a new
 
06:31:15.230 --> 06:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity or has created a new
 
06:31:18.310 --> 06:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for both Municipal savings
 
06:31:22.070 --> 06:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
as well as markets for low-grade and as
 
06:31:25.070 --> 06:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
well as local jobs and the beauty of it
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
is it's a local homegrown energy source
 
06:31:31.548 --> 06:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
that comes here and employs employs
 
06:31:33.350 --> 06:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
people in the state
 
06:31:34.750 --> 06:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
the question
 
06:31:37.310 --> 06:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
I want to kind of conclude my testimony
 
06:31:38.510 --> 06:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
to get to this question of
 
06:31:41.150 --> 06:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
sustainability carbon
 
06:31:41.160 --> 06:31:41.990 align:start position:0%
sustainability carbon
Etc

06:31:41.990 --> 06:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
06:31:45.948 --> 06:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's we nhtoa and as you
 
06:31:49.010 --> 06:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
heard earlier EPA have concluded biomass
 
06:31:52.910 --> 06:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
is is sustainable and in terms of carbon
 
06:31:56.208 --> 06:31:56.218 align:start position:0%
neutrality I would I would strongly
 
06:31:58.190 --> 06:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
argue that it is and you have to look no
 
06:32:01.430 --> 06:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
further than the usda's forest service
 
06:32:04.010 --> 06:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
data that shows in the state of New
 
06:32:07.490 --> 06:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we grow more wood than is
 
06:32:10.390 --> 06:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
harvested or dies of natural mortality
 
06:32:13.490 --> 06:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
so even with our power plants running
 
06:32:15.890 --> 06:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
and our Sawmills We are continuing to
 
06:32:19.310 --> 06:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
accrue Carbon on the landscape as our
 
06:32:23.110 --> 06:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
through our forest that doesn't include
 
06:32:26.810 --> 06:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
the carbon that's stored in this desk so
 
06:32:28.930 --> 06:32:28.940 align:start position:0%
this question about is biomass
 
06:32:31.610 --> 06:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
environmentally is it an environmentally
 
06:32:34.670 --> 06:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
friendly or or carbon-friendly energy
 
06:32:37.730 --> 06:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
source the proof is right here the the
 
06:32:40.788 --> 06:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
you have to look no further than that I
 
06:32:44.208 --> 06:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
also included the this it's kind of
 
06:32:45.770 --> 06:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
cartoonish but it's from our friends at
 
06:32:49.150 --> 06:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
the USDA this biogenic versus
 
06:32:51.288 --> 06:32:51.298 align:start position:0%
geologic carbon
 
06:32:56.270 --> 06:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh handout to kind of illustrate that
 
06:32:58.310 --> 06:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is a carbon
 
06:33:01.010 --> 06:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
cycle that circulates
 
06:33:02.810 --> 06:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
the thing in New Hampshire unlike
 
06:33:05.990 --> 06:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
Western States our issue is not planting
 
06:33:08.510 --> 06:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
trees our issue is controlling growth
 
06:33:11.030 --> 06:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is we continue
 
06:33:12.830 --> 06:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
to grow more wood
 
06:33:15.590 --> 06:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
we continue you go in and do a a
 
06:33:15.600 --> 06:33:16.730 align:start position:0%
we continue you go in and do a a
clear-cut

06:33:16.730 --> 06:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
clear-cut
 
06:33:19.548 --> 06:33:19.558 align:start position:0%
it grows back I tell folks don't mow
 
06:33:21.170 --> 06:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
your lawn for a couple years and see
 
06:33:24.048 --> 06:33:24.058 align:start position:0%
what happens you will get trees
 
06:33:26.628 --> 06:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
um it's it's and we are we are very
 
06:33:29.510 --> 06:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
fortunate to be in that situation
 
06:33:31.548 --> 06:33:31.558 align:start position:0%
so again
 
06:33:36.410 --> 06:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
um as a as an industry this this RPS law
 
06:33:39.590 --> 06:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a classic intersection between policy
 
06:33:42.230 --> 06:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
utility policy natural resource
 
06:33:44.930 --> 06:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
management and I would dare say rural
 
06:33:47.570 --> 06:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
economics rural economics
 
06:33:49.970 --> 06:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
we Plymouth state did an analysis
 
06:33:53.030 --> 06:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
economic analysis each log truck or chip
 
06:33:55.548 --> 06:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
van that goes down the road there are 15
 
06:33:58.250 --> 06:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
this was done in 2014
 
06:34:01.368 --> 06:34:01.378 align:start position:0%
at that time the value economic activity
 
06:34:04.010 --> 06:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
to get that truck from the log Landing
 
06:34:06.048 --> 06:34:06.058 align:start position:0%
to either the power plant or the
 
06:34:08.510 --> 06:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
Sawmills fifteen hundred dollars is
 
06:34:10.730 --> 06:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
economic activity that's Timber taxes
 
06:34:13.030 --> 06:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
paid to towns that's logger salary
 
06:34:15.650 --> 06:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's fuel that's diesel fuel that's
 
06:34:17.810 --> 06:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
used for the truck and the skidder so
 
06:34:20.048 --> 06:34:20.058 align:start position:0%
for us this is a big issue
 
06:34:22.850 --> 06:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
this is why we when we look at House
 
06:34:28.368 --> 06:34:28.378 align:start position:0%
Bill 165 and 166 earlier or 166 and 165
 
06:34:30.830 --> 06:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
earlier this is why we've come today to
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition I'd be happy to try
 
06:34:35.150 --> 06:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions and if folks
 
06:34:37.850 --> 06:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
want more information I can bury you in
 
06:34:44.570 --> 06:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
it from from EPA and the USDA
 
06:34:47.448 --> 06:34:47.458 align:start position:0%
thank you wonderful information
 
06:34:49.430 --> 06:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
I will allow questions but I'll remind
 
06:34:51.110 --> 06:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
members that we have five more pink
 
06:34:53.530 --> 06:34:53.540 align:start position:0%
cards here for this public hearing
 
06:34:55.670 --> 06:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:34:57.530 --> 06:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
06:35:00.048 --> 06:35:00.058 align:start position:0%
um just in your written testimony um at
 
06:35:02.150 --> 06:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page one you say
 
06:35:04.070 --> 06:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately due to the nature of our
 
06:35:07.070 --> 06:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
Timber types and soils two-thirds of our
 
06:35:09.770 --> 06:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
forests are growing low-grade Timber
 
06:35:12.170 --> 06:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
has that has it always been like that or
 
06:35:14.750 --> 06:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
has something changed recently it's it's
 
06:35:17.150 --> 06:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
always been around that
 
06:35:20.390 --> 06:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
um it's the nature we don't owe we don't
 
06:35:23.270 --> 06:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
grow Sequoias or big beautiful Douglas
 
06:35:26.570 --> 06:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
Firs we grow Twisted we love all our
 
06:35:28.910 --> 06:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
trees but you know look at a red maple
 
06:35:31.910 --> 06:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
look at a birch tree a lot of them are
 
06:35:33.590 --> 06:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
just it's just the nature of how they
 
06:35:35.628 --> 06:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
grow if you can get one saw log out of
 
06:35:38.150 --> 06:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
that consider yourself lucky
 
06:35:41.150 --> 06:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
um the rest of it you either chip or you
 
06:35:43.070 --> 06:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
try to find you know cut it up for
 
06:35:43.080 --> 06:35:44.510 align:start position:0%
try to find you know cut it up for
firewood

06:35:44.510 --> 06:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
firewood
 
06:35:46.970 --> 06:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
oh thank you representative Corman has a
 
06:35:46.980 --> 06:35:47.868 align:start position:0%
oh thank you representative Corman has a
question

06:35:47.868 --> 06:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:35:49.610 --> 06:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:35:51.470 --> 06:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question I haven't had a
 
06:35:52.670 --> 06:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
chance to actually read your written
 
06:35:55.070 --> 06:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
testimony but uh do you have any
 
06:35:58.368 --> 06:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
estimate for the impact on on the labor
 
06:36:01.010 --> 06:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
market in the forestry industry or the
 
06:36:03.650 --> 06:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
the economic impact in terms of dollars
 
06:36:06.350 --> 06:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
should this bill pass
 
06:36:09.890 --> 06:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
we do I mean we we there has been there
 
06:36:12.048 --> 06:36:12.058 align:start position:0%
has been economic analysis done and I
 
06:36:14.270 --> 06:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
can I can provide you some information I
 
06:36:16.670 --> 06:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it with me today but when
 
06:36:19.128 --> 06:36:19.138 align:start position:0%
we look at when we look at the states
 
06:36:21.948 --> 06:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
and you look at this economic report the
 
06:36:24.230 --> 06:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
forest products industry employs about
 
06:36:26.690 --> 06:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
12 000 individuals directly and
 
06:36:26.700 --> 06:36:28.128 align:start position:0%
12 000 individuals directly and
indirectly

06:36:28.128 --> 06:36:28.138 align:start position:0%
indirectly
 
06:36:31.750 --> 06:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
biomass is part of this interconnected
 
06:36:33.890 --> 06:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
supply chain
 
06:36:35.330 --> 06:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
so you say all right we're going to
 
06:36:38.448 --> 06:36:38.458 align:start position:0%
remove biomass we pass this bill these
 
06:36:39.770 --> 06:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
plants close
 
06:36:41.628 --> 06:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
okay you say well that's Mike's 20
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
people in his in his yard well that
 
06:36:46.250 --> 06:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
affects the loggers that delivered there
 
06:36:48.230 --> 06:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
that affects the Sawmills that took
 
06:36:50.390 --> 06:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
would take their chips there so this
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
this ripple effect and there was some
 
06:36:54.650 --> 06:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
analysis done
 
06:36:57.708 --> 06:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
um a couple years ago that I I'm happy
 
06:36:59.330 --> 06:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
to provide to the committee that tries
 
06:37:06.410 --> 06:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:09.170 --> 06:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question
 
06:37:11.270 --> 06:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Boltz and a real
 
06:37:13.310 --> 06:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
quick uh thank you for taking my
 
06:37:14.990 --> 06:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
question certainly
 
06:37:15.000 --> 06:37:16.010 align:start position:0%
question certainly
um

06:37:16.010 --> 06:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:16.020 --> 06:37:18.170 align:start position:0%
um
on

06:37:18.170 --> 06:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:37:20.930 --> 06:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
pests like the pine bore and all the
 
06:37:23.570 --> 06:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
combustion of this low-grade wood do you
 
06:37:26.570 --> 06:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
know if it had is anything out there
 
06:37:30.650 --> 06:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
the effect of this on the yeah that's a
 
06:37:31.910 --> 06:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
great question
 
06:37:33.948 --> 06:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
um that's one of the benefits of biomass
 
06:37:38.090 --> 06:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
is its ability to completely destroy it
 
06:37:40.850 --> 06:37:40.860 align:start position:0%
um emerald ash borer we have emerald ash
 
06:37:43.430 --> 06:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
borer chewing up our ash trees now you
 
06:37:44.990 --> 06:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
have an infestation
 
06:37:47.690 --> 06:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
you need to get rid of that rid of that
 
06:37:51.110 --> 06:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
material and want to try to control it
 
06:37:53.890 --> 06:37:53.900 align:start position:0%
biomass is a is a great way to do that
 
06:37:57.110 --> 06:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts had a What's
 
06:37:59.090 --> 06:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
called the Asian longhorn beetle and
 
06:38:00.650 --> 06:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
especially nasty little bug in the
 
06:38:04.368 --> 06:38:04.378 align:start position:0%
Worcester area they had to do a uh kind
 
06:38:07.190 --> 06:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
of a very strategic strategic
 
06:38:10.368 --> 06:38:10.378 align:start position:0%
containment process and the all the
 
06:38:12.708 --> 06:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
folks with the USDA
 
06:38:14.930 --> 06:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
Forest pest group said you have to burn
 
06:38:17.750 --> 06:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
this wood because that's the only way we
 
06:38:19.670 --> 06:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
can ensure that this pest is in fact
 
06:38:22.368 --> 06:38:22.378 align:start position:0%
eliminated if you were just to take the
 
06:38:24.590 --> 06:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
bark off it you run the risk that one of
 
06:38:26.330 --> 06:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
these eggs or one of these little larvae
 
06:38:29.690 --> 06:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
continue to continue to live and infest
 
06:38:34.190 --> 06:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:35.990 --> 06:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I'd
 
06:38:38.390 --> 06:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
like to call on the next individual who
 
06:38:39.650 --> 06:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to us and that's

welcome mark
 
06:38:46.610 --> 06:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
06:38:48.890 --> 06:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
um Mr Bose and thank you committee
 
06:38:48.900 --> 06:38:50.030 align:start position:0%
um Mr Bose and thank you committee
members

06:38:50.030 --> 06:38:50.040 align:start position:0%

06:38:52.610 --> 06:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
my name is Mark froling I own and
 
06:38:57.288 --> 06:38:57.298 align:start position:0%
operate a biomass boiler company in
 
06:38:58.970 --> 06:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
Keene New Hampshire
 
06:39:02.330 --> 06:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
and um I have
 
06:39:02.340 --> 06:39:03.010 align:start position:0%
and um I have
um

06:39:03.010 --> 06:39:03.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:06.470 --> 06:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
produced quite a few uh boiler
 
06:39:09.470 --> 06:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
installations over the last 10 years
 
06:39:13.190 --> 06:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
that are contributing to generating
 
06:39:17.868 --> 06:39:17.878 align:start position:0%
these wrecks and that has been the
 
06:39:20.628 --> 06:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
number one reason why I have sold these
 
06:39:23.170 --> 06:39:23.180 align:start position:0%
boiler plants so my business has greatly
 
06:39:28.010 --> 06:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
benefited in the past from these wrecks
 
06:39:31.430 --> 06:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
that were instituted a few years ago and
 
06:39:34.190 --> 06:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
driven quite a bit of business based on
 
06:39:37.070 --> 06:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
these wrecks being available
 
06:39:38.868 --> 06:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
um but more than that because that is in
 
06:39:40.730 --> 06:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
the past and that's not what this bill
 
06:39:42.350 --> 06:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
is addressing because it's keeping the
 
06:39:44.448 --> 06:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
past in place but
 
06:39:46.490 --> 06:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I have currently
 
06:39:48.770 --> 06:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
um you know my sales cycle because I'm
 
06:39:50.750 --> 06:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
proud predominantly in the public sector
 
06:39:54.110 --> 06:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
selling to counties to nursing homes
 
06:39:57.708 --> 06:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
jails and police facilities and things
 
06:40:00.410 --> 06:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
like that and also Public Schools I have
 
06:40:03.170 --> 06:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
about 17 projects that are in the queue
 
06:40:04.368 --> 06:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of years and
 
06:40:07.670 --> 06:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're all counting on these wrecks and
 
06:40:09.830 --> 06:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't think many of these projects
 
06:40:11.810 --> 06:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
go would go forward if these wrecks
 
06:40:12.948 --> 06:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
weren't available
 
06:40:15.890 --> 06:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's a really really important part of
 
06:40:19.430 --> 06:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
sort of our overall system people in the
 
06:40:20.930 --> 06:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
meantime that are interested in in
 
06:40:23.150 --> 06:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
biomass boilers
 
06:40:25.548 --> 06:40:25.558 align:start position:0%
that are generating or can generate
 
06:40:27.410 --> 06:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
these thermals wrecks they're really
 
06:40:29.390 --> 06:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
counting on that wreck Revenue to
 
06:40:31.430 --> 06:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
finance their system they don't always
 
06:40:34.010 --> 06:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
get grants capped for the capital and so
 
06:40:35.690 --> 06:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
they finance them over the time through
 
06:40:38.150 --> 06:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
these wrecks and it's been just a
 
06:40:42.650 --> 06:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
tremendous benefit to to these owners or
 
06:40:45.048 --> 06:40:45.058 align:start position:0%
the new potential owners but if that
 
06:40:47.690 --> 06:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
goes away it would be a real dilemma for
 
06:40:50.628 --> 06:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
my business because I really have not
 
06:40:52.850 --> 06:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
sold any
 
06:40:55.850 --> 06:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
um reasonable size boilerplants without
 
06:40:58.850 --> 06:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
the Rex not a single one because the Rex
 
06:41:01.490 --> 06:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
drive that business and so it's quite
 
06:41:03.230 --> 06:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
important to me to keep these wrecks in
 
06:41:06.948 --> 06:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
place and I greatly oppose this bill
 
06:41:09.350 --> 06:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has any questions
 
06:41:09.360 --> 06:41:10.250 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has any questions
um

06:41:10.250 --> 06:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:13.010 --> 06:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer
 
06:41:15.048 --> 06:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial has a
 
06:41:15.058 --> 06:41:16.430 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial has a
question

06:41:16.430 --> 06:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:41:18.470 --> 06:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chair votes and thank you for
 
06:41:19.910 --> 06:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
coming today
 
06:41:21.770 --> 06:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me approximately I have
 
06:41:23.030 --> 06:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
had the pleasure of turning your plant
 
06:41:25.850 --> 06:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
can you tell me approximately about how
 
06:41:28.070 --> 06:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
many people you directly employ in your
 
06:41:30.230 --> 06:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
plant and maybe give me an idea of an
 
06:41:33.230 --> 06:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
economic impact to the Keen area
 
06:41:35.270 --> 06:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have
 
06:41:38.990 --> 06:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
um 15 direct employees and with a
 
06:41:43.128 --> 06:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
payroll of 875 000 you know for last
 
06:41:43.138 --> 06:41:44.390 align:start position:0%
payroll of 875 000 you know for last
year

06:41:44.390 --> 06:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:41:49.208 --> 06:41:49.218 align:start position:0%
and um then indirectly of course we have
 
06:41:52.548 --> 06:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
truckers that provide us from other
 
06:41:55.190 --> 06:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
Sawmills that provide us the materials
 
06:41:57.830 --> 06:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
and truckers that sometimes
 
06:42:00.830 --> 06:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
um you know send material out
 
06:42:02.510 --> 06:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of subcontractors
 
06:42:04.730 --> 06:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
through that business there's
 
06:42:07.368 --> 06:42:07.378 align:start position:0%
um mechanical construction outfits that
 
06:42:10.670 --> 06:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
we hire and so indirectly you know I
 
06:42:12.288 --> 06:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
don't know how large that envelope is
 
06:42:14.830 --> 06:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
but it's quite significant we drive
 
06:42:17.330 --> 06:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
between three and five million dollars
 
06:42:20.030 --> 06:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
any given year depending on how things
 
06:42:22.010 --> 06:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
going right now it's actually a great
 
06:42:23.690 --> 06:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
time for biomass because in general
 
06:42:26.448 --> 06:42:26.458 align:start position:0%
energy has gone quite High the cost of
 
06:42:29.690 --> 06:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
energy has gone up quite a bit and so
 
06:42:33.470 --> 06:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
biomass it being a very affordable
 
06:42:35.570 --> 06:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know energy
 
06:42:37.368 --> 06:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
um is really having its Heyday right now
 
06:42:39.470 --> 06:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
and sort of pulling the rug out under it
 
06:42:41.890 --> 06:42:41.900 align:start position:0%
this would be the worst possible time
 
06:42:44.150 --> 06:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely the worst possible time I
 
06:42:45.470 --> 06:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
cannot see how this house bill was
 
06:42:47.270 --> 06:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
really thought through doesn't make
 
06:42:50.570 --> 06:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
sense to me um why why you would kind of
 
06:42:51.948 --> 06:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
pull this
 
06:42:54.350 --> 06:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
um support out when it's really a good
 
06:42:56.390 --> 06:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
time to support it and make this all
 
06:42:56.400 --> 06:42:58.910 align:start position:0%
time to support it and make this all
work

06:42:58.910 --> 06:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:02.208 --> 06:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
so I have a question yeah
 
06:43:05.208 --> 06:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
did I understand you to say that
 
06:43:08.150 --> 06:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
the 17 projects you have in your queue
 
06:43:10.310 --> 06:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
would not go forward without
 
06:43:12.830 --> 06:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
thermal wrecks I can't speak on behalf
 
06:43:14.628 --> 06:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
of my customers because I don't make
 
06:43:17.090 --> 06:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
their decisions but if I told them that
 
06:43:18.708 --> 06:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
the wrecks weren't available coming into
 
06:43:20.510 --> 06:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
the future
 
06:43:22.910 --> 06:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
um here for the next couple years they
 
06:43:22.920 --> 06:43:23.570 align:start position:0%
um here for the next couple years they
um

06:43:23.570 --> 06:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:25.910 --> 06:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many projects would go
 
06:43:27.708 --> 06:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
forward but very few because I really
 
06:43:30.470 --> 06:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
frankly have not sold any projects in
 
06:43:31.850 --> 06:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
that size range of course we sell
 
06:43:34.010 --> 06:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
residential projects they don't utilize
 
06:43:36.170 --> 06:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
the wrecked Market but on the large
 
06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
scale where we go into a school they
 
06:43:42.048 --> 06:43:42.058 align:start position:0%
absolutely make this work with the
 
06:43:43.850 --> 06:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
public because it's always funded by the
 
06:43:45.530 --> 06:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
public on top of it of course through a
 
06:43:47.810 --> 06:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
bond and things like that they see that
 
06:43:49.368 --> 06:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream when the public sees
 
06:43:51.470 --> 06:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's no support on that then it's
 
06:43:53.570 --> 06:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
very difficult because it's just you
 
06:43:53.580 --> 06:43:54.410 align:start position:0%
very difficult because it's just you
know

06:43:54.410 --> 06:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:43:58.070 --> 06:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
so even though the price of oil has gone
 
06:44:00.170 --> 06:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
up substantially in the last year year
 
06:44:03.430 --> 06:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
and a half it's still not economic to
 
06:44:06.288 --> 06:44:06.298 align:start position:0%
convert to wood boilers without this
 
06:44:09.650 --> 06:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
additional help is that it it's economic
 
06:44:12.650 --> 06:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
but this wreck is a really nice steady
 
06:44:14.690 --> 06:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
stream so when you have grants coming in
 
06:44:15.948 --> 06:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
a one-time Grant during the construction
 
06:44:18.650 --> 06:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
it's nice for sure nobody turns down a
 
06:44:21.110 --> 06:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
good grant money but people really value
 
06:44:23.930 --> 06:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
the long-term gra excuse me the
 
06:44:25.788 --> 06:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
long-term money that goes with
 
06:44:28.128 --> 06:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
generation and there's many reasons for
 
06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
for why that is so valuable because it
 
06:44:34.548 --> 06:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
also allows the plant to be always tuned
 
06:44:36.170 --> 06:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
to the top efficiency because people
 
06:44:37.610 --> 06:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
want to get the most amount of wrecks
 
06:44:40.730 --> 06:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
out so it's sort of a self
 
06:44:40.740 --> 06:44:41.570 align:start position:0%
out so it's sort of a self
um

06:44:41.570 --> 06:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:41.580 --> 06:44:43.788 align:start position:0%
um

06:44:47.030 --> 06:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
um system that works really well and so
 
06:44:49.788 --> 06:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
we have of course benefited of it I'm
 
06:44:51.770 --> 06:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
personally also generating wrecks in my
 
06:44:54.250 --> 06:44:54.260 align:start position:0%
own plan to grind to dry trips myself
 
06:44:56.090 --> 06:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:44:59.270 --> 06:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we are at 75 I know earlier
 
06:45:00.948 --> 06:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
on Mr Harrington was saying that people
 
06:45:03.288 --> 06:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
are generating thermal efficiencies of
 
06:45:06.170 --> 06:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
30 that hasn't been done in forever I
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
think but really normal thermal
 
06:45:11.448 --> 06:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
efficiencies of boilers these days are
 
06:45:14.810 --> 06:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
between 70 for a steam boiler and 84 for
 
06:45:17.270 --> 06:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
pellet boiler that is sort of where it's
 
06:45:20.570 --> 06:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
at and if you're going Cogen like we do
 
06:45:22.310 --> 06:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
um you know we're going kojan with steam
 
06:45:25.190 --> 06:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
you can certainly be at 74 75 percent
 
06:45:28.430 --> 06:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's all very efficient and um
 
06:45:31.250 --> 06:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's a good system and I would really
 
06:45:31.260 --> 06:45:31.850 align:start position:0%
it's a good system and I would really
um

06:45:31.850 --> 06:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:34.788 --> 06:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
recommend to keep this in place okay we
 
06:45:36.430 --> 06:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
don't need a sales pitch but
 
06:45:36.440 --> 06:45:38.048 align:start position:0%
don't need a sales pitch but
Representatives

06:45:38.048 --> 06:45:38.058 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
06:45:40.490 --> 06:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
no representative Reynolds doesn't have
 
06:45:41.570 --> 06:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
a question
 
06:45:43.310 --> 06:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
okay so you know further questions we
 
06:45:45.890 --> 06:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and next we'll
 
06:45:47.990 --> 06:45:48.000 align:start position:0%

06:46:02.510 --> 06:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon Mr
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and honorable committee members
 
06:46:05.868 --> 06:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
my name is Nick Krakoff with the
 
06:46:07.910 --> 06:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
conservation law foundation and thank
 
06:46:10.490 --> 06:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to testify today
 
06:46:12.830 --> 06:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
the RPS benefits New Hampshire's economy
 
06:46:14.930 --> 06:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
provides public health and environmental
 
06:46:16.730 --> 06:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
benefits from New Hampshire and even
 
06:46:18.230 --> 06:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
helps reduce energy rates for New
 
06:46:19.968 --> 06:46:19.978 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's families and businesses
 
06:46:23.090 --> 06:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
because HP 166 would severely weaken the
 
06:46:25.070 --> 06:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
RPS I urge the committee to oppose this
 
06:46:25.080 --> 06:46:26.090 align:start position:0%
RPS I urge the committee to oppose this
bill

06:46:26.090 --> 06:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:46:28.190 --> 06:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will be unable to fully
 
06:46:30.288 --> 06:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the significant
 
06:46:31.968 --> 06:46:31.978 align:start position:0%
economic benefits of Renewables that
 
06:46:34.070 --> 06:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
this bill has passed specifically with
 
06:46:36.288 --> 06:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
respect to provision or section number
 
06:46:38.510 --> 06:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
two in the in the bill
 
06:46:39.890 --> 06:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
um that but that provision would
 
06:46:42.830 --> 06:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
severely weaken the RPS standard and the
 
06:46:44.690 --> 06:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
RPS supports increased investments in
 
06:46:46.910 --> 06:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
Renewables like solar and wind
 
06:46:49.310 --> 06:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
and brings local renewable energy jobs
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:46:52.670 --> 06:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
and So to avoid New Hampshire losing out
 
06:46:54.650 --> 06:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
on the development of a renewable energy
 
06:46:56.750 --> 06:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
industry here while neighboring states
 
06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
reap the benefits the committee should
 
06:47:00.650 --> 06:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
really reject this bill
 
06:47:03.410 --> 06:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
um as one of the testifiers spoke to
 
06:47:05.690 --> 06:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
earlier one of the purposes of the RPS
 
06:47:07.910 --> 06:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
is really to provide energy diversity
 
06:47:07.920 --> 06:47:09.250 align:start position:0%
is really to provide energy diversity
benefits

06:47:09.250 --> 06:47:09.260 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
06:47:12.770 --> 06:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
and so as we all know as we're aware New
 
06:47:14.090 --> 06:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families and businesses are
 
06:47:15.890 --> 06:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
suffering from high energy rates at the
 
06:47:18.048 --> 06:47:18.058 align:start position:0%
moment and these rates are largely the
 
06:47:21.770 --> 06:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
result of extremely high natural gas
 
06:47:23.990 --> 06:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
prices you know natural gas prices are
 
06:47:27.110 --> 06:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
extremely volatile and you know our
 
06:47:29.208 --> 06:47:29.218 align:start position:0%
state and our region are you know
 
06:47:30.410 --> 06:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's an over-dependence on natural
 
06:47:33.530 --> 06:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
gas for power generation right now in
 
06:47:35.510 --> 06:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
contrast the price of Renewables they
 
06:47:37.310 --> 06:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
have a very they're inherently more
 
06:47:41.030 --> 06:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
stable than fossil fuels and can um you
 
06:47:42.890 --> 06:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
know it can even cost less than fossil
 
06:47:45.110 --> 06:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
fuels I provided written testimony that
 
06:47:48.110 --> 06:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
shows that Renewables are starting to be
 
06:47:49.968 --> 06:47:49.978 align:start position:0%
cost competitive even can cost less than
 
06:47:52.910 --> 06:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
fossil of yours in some instances and so
 
06:47:54.530 --> 06:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
increased investments in RBS they
 
06:47:56.090 --> 06:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
provide significant energy diversity
 
06:47:57.530 --> 06:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
benefits which is one of the purposes of
 
06:47:59.628 --> 06:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
the RPS statute and that can help
 
06:48:01.490 --> 06:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
insulate families and businesses from
 
06:48:04.190 --> 06:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
those volatile fossil fuel prices and
 
06:48:05.390 --> 06:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
have a price suppressing effect on
 
06:48:07.330 --> 06:48:07.340 align:start position:0%
electric rates
 
06:48:10.548 --> 06:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
but HP 166 would just lead to New
 
06:48:12.170 --> 06:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being more exposed to volatile
 
06:48:13.910 --> 06:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel prices
 
06:48:16.128 --> 06:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
and then finally the RPS provides public
 
06:48:17.830 --> 06:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
health and environmental benefits
 
06:48:20.030 --> 06:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
pollution from fossil fuels contributes
 
06:48:22.968 --> 06:48:22.978 align:start position:0%
to asthma and other respiratory diseases
 
06:48:25.010 --> 06:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
and increased use of Renewables is
 
06:48:26.390 --> 06:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
important for addressing the climate
 
06:48:28.128 --> 06:48:28.138 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
06:48:29.270 --> 06:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know when New Hampshire is already
 
06:48:32.510 --> 06:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
experiencing mild Winters and increased
 
06:48:34.548 --> 06:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
coastal flooding from climate change
 
06:48:36.110 --> 06:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
and so at a time we need to start
 
06:48:38.930 --> 06:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
addressing climate change HP 166 would
 
06:48:41.750 --> 06:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
be a step in the wrong direction and
 
06:48:43.730 --> 06:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
disregard our responsibility for dealing
 
06:48:45.650 --> 06:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
with that crisis so
 
06:48:47.150 --> 06:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and it's um
 
06:48:49.128 --> 06:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
the RPS is good for the economy for
 
06:48:51.110 --> 06:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
diversity benefits and for the
 
06:48:53.330 --> 06:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
environment public health and I urge the
 
06:48:54.948 --> 06:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
committee to vote against this bill to
 
06:48:58.070 --> 06:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
vote itl okay thank you happy to take
 
06:49:00.410 --> 06:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:49:02.750 --> 06:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions I thank you for your
 
06:49:05.390 --> 06:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
testimony and turn to the next speaker
 
06:49:07.510 --> 06:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
who will be Jim
 
06:49:09.948 --> 06:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
Monahan from
 
06:49:11.390 --> 06:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
who is representing the New Hampshire
 
06:49:14.150 --> 06:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
Association of counties wearing
 
06:49:18.650 --> 06:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:20.510 --> 06:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm Jim Monahan
 
06:49:22.490 --> 06:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
with the DuPont group uh and I'm wearing
 
06:49:23.930 --> 06:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
my New Hampshire Association of County
 
06:49:26.208 --> 06:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
hat uh this afternoon
 
06:49:29.330 --> 06:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
um we appeared today in in opposition to
 
06:49:31.910 --> 06:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 166 and I'll be brief you all
 
06:49:33.530 --> 06:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
have seen the list of facilities that
 
06:49:35.030 --> 06:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
are included in the project that include
 
06:49:37.548 --> 06:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
Five County facilities two in Chester
 
06:49:40.368 --> 06:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
County as well as Merrimack Rockingham
 
06:49:43.070 --> 06:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
and Sullivan County all many of you were
 
06:49:45.170 --> 06:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
perhaps were on your served on your
 
06:49:46.968 --> 06:49:46.978 align:start position:0%
delegations when the decisions were made
 
06:49:49.490 --> 06:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
to cite these facilities as you all know
 
06:49:51.288 --> 06:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
they penciled out because you had the
 
06:49:53.868 --> 06:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
benefit of the uh the T-Rex as a part of
 
06:49:55.788 --> 06:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
it so there's a lot of potential for
 
06:49:59.150 --> 06:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
disruption uh to the county budgets in
 
06:50:01.070 --> 06:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
the way they handle energy costs for the
 
06:50:04.190 --> 06:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
county so I won't I'm certainly happy to
 
06:50:05.990 --> 06:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have but
 
06:50:07.250 --> 06:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
I think you've had a lot of testimony
 
06:50:07.260 --> 06:50:11.330 align:start position:0%
I think you've had a lot of testimony
today

06:50:11.330 --> 06:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:14.208 --> 06:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
okay see no one uh who wants to ask a
 
06:50:16.070 --> 06:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
question I'll call the next
 
06:50:19.548 --> 06:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
the pin up penultimate speaker on this
 
06:50:22.190 --> 06:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh public hearing and that's Matt Leahy
 
06:50:29.330 --> 06:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:31.490 --> 06:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
and Mr Leahy
 
06:50:34.190 --> 06:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'll be quick it would be nice if you
 
06:50:36.230 --> 06:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
didn't repeat the information we've
 
06:50:37.968 --> 06:50:37.978 align:start position:0%
already heard yeah no I I did submit
 
06:50:39.530 --> 06:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
written testimony earlier I'm not going
 
06:50:41.868 --> 06:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
to repeat that I just wanted to add one
 
06:50:44.390 --> 06:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
comment and just sort of an add-on to
 
06:50:46.788 --> 06:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
what Jason was saying about
 
06:50:49.788 --> 06:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
uh low-grade wood markets you know that
 
06:50:51.770 --> 06:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
connection between Forest management and
 
06:50:53.390 --> 06:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
low-grade wooden markets so if you
 
06:50:55.310 --> 06:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
remember last session the legislature
 
06:50:55.320 --> 06:50:56.690 align:start position:0%
remember last session the legislature
created

06:50:56.690 --> 06:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
created
 
06:50:58.250 --> 06:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire low-grade Timber
 
06:51:01.310 --> 06:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
and wood Emerging Market commission uh
 
06:51:02.990 --> 06:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas was the Prime
 
06:51:04.910 --> 06:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor on that
 
06:51:07.670 --> 06:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
um you know and one of the charges of
 
06:51:10.128 --> 06:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
that commission was to look into
 
06:51:13.968 --> 06:51:13.978 align:start position:0%
you know State policy that could benefit
 
06:51:18.048 --> 06:51:18.058 align:start position:0%
or or create new or expand markets for
 
06:51:22.010 --> 06:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
for low-grade wood and when we look at
 
06:51:22.020 --> 06:51:23.208 align:start position:0%
for low-grade wood and when we look at
um

06:51:23.208 --> 06:51:23.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:25.968 --> 06:51:25.978 align:start position:0%
thermal energy you know a locally
 
06:51:30.170 --> 06:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
sourced thermal energy we we have a
 
06:51:32.570 --> 06:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
solution to one of the questions that
 
06:51:34.670 --> 06:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
this commission is looking at so we
 
06:51:36.890 --> 06:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
would urge um
 
06:51:39.410 --> 06:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
this committee to vote against House
 
06:51:41.390 --> 06:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 166 because we think that there is
 
06:51:43.788 --> 06:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
a market we have here for low-grade wood
 
06:51:46.070 --> 06:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions though
 
06:51:47.510 --> 06:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you do you serve on that
 
06:51:50.270 --> 06:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
commission I do not no no
 
06:51:50.280 --> 06:51:51.410 align:start position:0%
commission I do not no no
okay

06:51:51.410 --> 06:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:51:53.990 --> 06:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
good to know
 
06:51:56.208 --> 06:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no questions from the
 
06:51:59.390 --> 06:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh committee I'll Now call on our final
 
06:52:01.310 --> 06:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
speaker I always like to give the last
 
06:52:03.530 --> 06:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
word to Sam Evans Brown of clean energy
 
06:52:06.350 --> 06:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:08.570 --> 06:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
I think I'm frequently last on the list
 
06:52:10.730 --> 06:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
because I'm frequently late uh and
 
06:52:12.708 --> 06:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
arrive just on time to the start of the
 
06:52:14.570 --> 06:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
hearing so my cards come in last
 
06:52:16.310 --> 06:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the record I'm Sam
 
06:52:17.690 --> 06:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown executive director of clean
 
06:52:20.090 --> 06:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire we also are
 
06:52:21.530 --> 06:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to this bill
 
06:52:23.750 --> 06:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that are in my written
 
06:52:25.548 --> 06:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
testimony which I'm happy to submit uh
 
06:52:27.110 --> 06:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
in just a moment were laid out by
 
06:52:28.368 --> 06:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
previous speakers so I will not repeat
 
06:52:28.378 --> 06:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
previous speakers so I will not repeat
them

06:52:29.510 --> 06:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:52:31.128 --> 06:52:31.138 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe the only point that I
 
06:52:33.350 --> 06:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
would like to hammer home on is that
 
06:52:35.510 --> 06:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
particularly the effect of reducing the
 
06:52:38.750 --> 06:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
class one Rec requirement to the the
 
06:52:40.788 --> 06:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
level that we have already achieved
 
06:52:43.910 --> 06:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
achieved today will have the effect of
 
06:52:45.770 --> 06:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
driving the value of renewable energy
 
06:52:47.628 --> 06:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
credits down
 
06:52:49.968 --> 06:52:49.978 align:start position:0%
ostensibly to the point where whatever
 
06:52:51.948 --> 06:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
the market equilibrium is for that for
 
06:52:54.170 --> 06:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
that wreck price is but close to zero
 
06:52:56.750 --> 06:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
there are precious few policies that New
 
06:52:58.250 --> 06:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has on the books that are
 
06:52:59.750 --> 06:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging the construction of new
 
06:53:02.030 --> 06:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
generation and it is very hard to build
 
06:53:04.968 --> 06:53:04.978 align:start position:0%
anything in New Hampshire and I think it
 
06:53:06.788 --> 06:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
has given our our current energy
 
06:53:09.650 --> 06:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
situation we should be actively
 
06:53:11.270 --> 06:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
encouraging the construction of new
 
06:53:13.368 --> 06:53:13.378 align:start position:0%
generation and this is this is one of
 
06:53:15.048 --> 06:53:15.058 align:start position:0%
the very few policies that's that's
 
06:53:16.730 --> 06:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
doing that it's doing it in a
 
06:53:19.190 --> 06:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
market-based way uh in a way that should
 
06:53:22.430 --> 06:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
respond to Market forces and and achieve
 
06:53:24.350 --> 06:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
a state of equilibrium once we have
 
06:53:26.810 --> 06:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
built enough to to meet the RPS
 
06:53:28.490 --> 06:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
requirements so with that I'll take any
 
06:53:30.590 --> 06:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
questions if the committee has any
 
06:53:32.810 --> 06:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for making that excellent
 
06:53:32.820 --> 06:53:35.930 align:start position:0%
thank you for making that excellent
point

06:53:35.930 --> 06:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:37.730 --> 06:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions from the committee
 
06:53:40.730 --> 06:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your being here and
 
06:53:43.070 --> 06:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
testifying and with that I will close
 
06:53:45.048 --> 06:53:45.058 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
06:53:49.128 --> 06:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 166 and ask representative
 
06:53:52.190 --> 06:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
closure to reveal the blue sheet
 
06:53:58.250 --> 06:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:00.288 --> 06:54:00.298 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Bulls
 
06:54:04.788 --> 06:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
H um House Bill 166 the blue sheet was
 
06:54:06.948 --> 06:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
none in favor
 
06:54:11.810 --> 06:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
nine opposed online two in favor 41
 
06:54:11.820 --> 06:54:15.830 align:start position:0%
nine opposed online two in favor 41
opposed

06:54:15.830 --> 06:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:17.628 --> 06:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we're going to go
 
06:54:20.990 --> 06:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
immediately into a public hearing on
 
06:54:23.330 --> 06:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 81 establishing a study
 
06:54:26.288 --> 06:54:26.298 align:start position:0%
committee to examine all ancillary
 
06:54:29.690 --> 06:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
charges for propane gas sales and I'm
 
06:54:32.330 --> 06:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
going to call up to the table the prime
 
06:54:34.490 --> 06:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this proposed legislation
 
06:54:38.208 --> 06:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
that's Rose representative Rosemary rung
 
06:54:41.390 --> 06:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
of Hillsboro District 12.
 
06:54:43.430 --> 06:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you much thank you very much Mr
 
06:54:46.850 --> 06:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you to the committee
 
06:54:49.910 --> 06:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
um last fall I got a email from a
 
06:54:52.128 --> 06:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine who was very
 
06:54:54.948 --> 06:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about practices he was or
 
06:54:56.930 --> 06:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
problems he was experiencing with his
 
06:54:58.810 --> 06:54:58.820 align:start position:0%
propane gas company
 
06:55:02.448 --> 06:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
and he wanted me to pursue a legislative
 
06:55:06.170 --> 06:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
remedy and not knowing how extensive
 
06:55:08.448 --> 06:55:08.458 align:start position:0%
this problem was if it
 
06:55:11.448 --> 06:55:11.458 align:start position:0%
was shared by other constituents I put
 
06:55:13.810 --> 06:55:13.820 align:start position:0%
something on our community Facebook page
 
06:55:17.330 --> 06:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
and I was very amazed at the response
 
06:55:18.590 --> 06:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I've included some of those
 
06:55:21.288 --> 06:55:21.298 align:start position:0%
responses in the written testimony I've
 
06:55:25.128 --> 06:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
distributed but I'm certain there is a
 
06:55:26.750 --> 06:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
pervasive problem with business
 
06:55:30.070 --> 06:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
practices of several at least one
 
06:55:32.390 --> 06:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
propane company operating in New
 
06:55:34.548 --> 06:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
06:55:38.090 --> 06:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
um HB 81 would set up a study committee
 
06:55:41.390 --> 06:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
of legislators to be able to collect
 
06:55:43.730 --> 06:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
facts about the industry hear from
 
06:55:45.948 --> 06:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
industry Representatives other
 
06:55:48.770 --> 06:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
constituents to determine if a
 
06:55:51.730 --> 06:55:51.740 align:start position:0%
legislative remedy is needed to address
 
06:55:54.890 --> 06:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
what may be appear to be some very
 
06:55:57.190 --> 06:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
unfair labor practices
 
06:56:00.110 --> 06:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
the major ones I've heard of is
 
06:56:02.690 --> 06:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
companies are charging rent on propane
 
06:56:06.468 --> 06:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
tanks that the customer already owns
 
06:56:08.810 --> 06:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
um or a customer may be calling a
 
06:56:12.468 --> 06:56:12.478 align:start position:0%
company to want to switch providers and
 
06:56:13.968 --> 06:56:13.978 align:start position:0%
the original company has to come and
 
06:56:15.230 --> 06:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
take their tank and they just don't
 
06:56:17.590 --> 06:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
respond so they continually charge rent
 
06:56:22.310 --> 06:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
and fees and on the customer and really
 
06:56:24.288 --> 06:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
making them unable to be able to switch
 
06:56:27.770 --> 06:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
to a more affordable provider other
 
06:56:32.150 --> 06:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
issues are um arbitrary minimum set to
 
06:56:34.628 --> 06:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
get a discount
 
06:56:36.890 --> 06:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know there's several other
 
06:56:39.310 --> 06:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
issues and I just think it's
 
06:56:41.750 --> 06:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to really understand
 
06:56:44.270 --> 06:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
this issue and determine whether we need
 
06:56:47.570 --> 06:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
to provide some consumer protection for
 
06:56:50.510 --> 06:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
people who rely on propane for Home
 
06:56:53.090 --> 06:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
Heating and I would be happy to answer
 
06:56:55.190 --> 06:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
any questions you have
 
06:56:57.410 --> 06:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for introducing
 
06:57:01.070 --> 06:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
this bill I have a question for you on
 
06:57:03.770 --> 06:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
my propane bill
 
06:57:07.070 --> 06:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
about three or four years ago
 
06:57:09.708 --> 06:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
there appeared a charge called the
 
06:57:13.850 --> 06:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
safety fee it was 9.95
 
06:57:15.590 --> 06:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
then a couple years later it went up to
 
06:57:18.590 --> 06:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
12.95 I just got to fill up the other
 
06:57:22.010 --> 06:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
day the safety fee is now up to 19.95.
 
06:57:24.708 --> 06:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
is that one of the ancillary charges
 
06:57:26.448 --> 06:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
that you want this committee to
 
06:57:29.330 --> 06:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
investigate yes it would be and I'm
 
06:57:31.490 --> 06:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
sorry to hear that chairman Vose
 
06:57:33.590 --> 06:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah you'd be great if you could be
 
06:57:36.110 --> 06:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
on the study committee uh if if this
 
06:57:38.750 --> 06:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
passes but an ancillary charge is
 
06:57:41.090 --> 06:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
considered any charge beyond the actual
 
06:57:44.448 --> 06:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
price of the product so anything in
 
06:57:46.250 --> 06:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
addition to the actual propane that's
 
06:57:49.010 --> 06:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
being purchased
 
06:57:51.590 --> 06:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative Doug Thomas has a
 
06:57:51.600 --> 06:57:52.368 align:start position:0%
okay representative Doug Thomas has a
question

06:57:52.368 --> 06:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:57:54.048 --> 06:57:54.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:57:55.610 --> 06:57:55.620 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:57:55.620 --> 06:57:56.448 align:start position:0%
my question
um

06:57:56.448 --> 06:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:00.230 --> 06:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
has any action been taken to notify the
 
06:58:03.850 --> 06:58:03.860 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to look into this issue
 
06:58:07.250 --> 06:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
in terms of just questioning if he's had
 
06:58:10.310 --> 06:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
complaints given to his department or
 
06:58:13.788 --> 06:58:13.798 align:start position:0%

um by one of my constituents that did
 
06:58:23.990 --> 06:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow up I haven't talked to the
 
06:58:26.690 --> 06:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to find out if
 
06:58:29.810 --> 06:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
they have been keeping a a summary of
 
06:58:31.490 --> 06:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
the complaints that they've had but I do
 
06:58:33.830 --> 06:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
know people have contacted them to
 
06:58:33.840 --> 06:58:37.190 align:start position:0%
know people have contacted them to
complain

06:58:37.190 --> 06:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:38.930 --> 06:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
06:58:41.628 --> 06:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a question
 
06:58:45.350 --> 06:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so regarding uh
 
06:58:49.610 --> 06:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
tank rental fees uh are you did you hear
 
06:58:52.690 --> 06:58:52.700 align:start position:0%
complaints about those fees
 
06:58:57.010 --> 06:58:57.020 align:start position:0%
uh being initially part of a
 
06:59:00.468 --> 06:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
purchase or an agreement to buy gas from
 
06:59:03.770 --> 06:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
a company and then being extended beyond
 
06:59:06.708 --> 06:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
the the initial period when supposedly
 
06:59:09.650 --> 06:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
the rental of the tank has had paid it
 
06:59:09.660 --> 06:59:11.510 align:start position:0%
the rental of the tank has had paid it
off

06:59:11.510 --> 06:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
off
 
06:59:13.250 --> 06:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question the
 
06:59:15.590 --> 06:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
complaints I've heard about are people
 
06:59:18.048 --> 06:59:18.058 align:start position:0%
have owned their tanks or they buy a
 
06:59:19.448 --> 06:59:19.458 align:start position:0%
house with a tank
 
06:59:22.010 --> 06:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
they've never signed a contract or an
 
06:59:24.530 --> 06:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
agreement with the company when they
 
06:59:27.350 --> 06:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
call they may get delivery they may have
 
06:59:30.110 --> 06:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
deliveries for one one of my
 
06:59:32.030 --> 06:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
constituents got deliveries for 10 years
 
06:59:34.430 --> 06:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
and then he started being charged a
 
06:59:35.708 --> 06:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
rental fee
 
06:59:39.288 --> 06:59:39.298 align:start position:0%
I've heard complaints where they've
 
06:59:41.208 --> 06:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
owned the tank they've never or they've
 
06:59:44.030 --> 06:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
never paid a rental fee but if they go
 
06:59:46.128 --> 06:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
without a fill up
 
06:59:48.230 --> 06:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
um they'll pay like they'll waive a
 
06:59:50.150 --> 06:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
rental fee if they haven't gotten a fill
 
06:59:53.270 --> 06:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
up or an order so let me give you an
 
06:59:56.570 --> 06:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
example let's say someone goes three
 
06:59:58.788 --> 06:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
years without
 
07:00:00.590 --> 07:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
um or I think there's one example where
 
07:00:02.930 --> 07:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
somebody had a propane heater on a
 
07:00:05.930 --> 07:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
swimming pool and after a few years they
 
07:00:08.208 --> 07:00:08.218 align:start position:0%
decided not to heat their pool anymore
 
07:00:10.310 --> 07:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
the heater had broken so they're not
 
07:00:12.650 --> 07:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
ordering propane pain so the company
 
07:00:15.110 --> 07:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
didn't is now charging them rent because
 
07:00:18.110 --> 07:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're not ordering propane
 
07:00:21.048 --> 07:00:21.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:23.390 --> 07:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
07:00:25.548 --> 07:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I had I've had some
 
07:00:29.208 --> 07:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
experience with propane dealers myself
 
07:00:29.218 --> 07:00:30.468 align:start position:0%
experience with propane dealers myself
um

07:00:30.468 --> 07:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:33.410 --> 07:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
uh I see that AmeriGas is mentioned
 
07:00:36.230 --> 07:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
quite a bit in your in your your
 
07:00:39.288 --> 07:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
testimony is that does that seem to be
 
07:00:42.468 --> 07:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
the one vendor that's generating most of
 
07:00:44.510 --> 07:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
the complaints
 
07:00:48.170 --> 07:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
as I've said I I haven't done a
 
07:00:51.770 --> 07:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
thorough objective survey of different
 
07:00:54.890 --> 07:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
companies but that is one I've heard of
 
07:00:57.170 --> 07:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
a lot I was actually surprised in the
 
07:00:58.368 --> 07:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
response I got that there were other
 
07:01:00.230 --> 07:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
companies mentioned too
 
07:01:02.868 --> 07:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
so but I think AmeriGas is probably one
 
07:01:04.670 --> 07:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
of the major ones mainly because there
 
07:01:09.110 --> 07:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:11.030 --> 07:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
07:01:13.610 --> 07:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:01:14.930 --> 07:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm one of those
 
07:01:17.208 --> 07:01:17.218 align:start position:0%
propane customers as well
 
07:01:18.890 --> 07:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
Ernie I know it's not listed at least I
 
07:01:20.150 --> 07:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it's listened here but have
 
07:01:21.948 --> 07:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
you had issues with folks when they try
 
07:01:23.750 --> 07:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
to change from propane company to
 
07:01:26.208 --> 07:01:26.218 align:start position:0%
another about the ownership of the tank
 
07:01:27.890 --> 07:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
the buying and the selling of the tank
 
07:01:29.448 --> 07:01:29.458 align:start position:0%
the transfer the tank from one company
 
07:01:30.650 --> 07:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
to another
 
07:01:33.350 --> 07:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I've heard a lot of complaints
 
07:01:36.890 --> 07:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
from constituents where their tank may
 
07:01:38.930 --> 07:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
have been owned by one company they go
 
07:01:41.150 --> 07:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
to switch and the company
 
07:01:44.330 --> 07:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
um like charges them an exorbitant fee
 
07:01:46.190 --> 07:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
to take out that tank to have the new
 
07:01:48.230 --> 07:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
company or they won't transfer ownership
 
07:01:50.868 --> 07:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
of the tank it really there's a lot of
 
07:01:57.948 --> 07:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:59.810 --> 07:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative munz has one more
 
07:02:03.170 --> 07:02:03.180 align:start position:0%

07:02:19.490 --> 07:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
legislation regarding industrial propane
 
07:02:22.070 --> 07:02:22.080 align:start position:0%

07:03:36.468 --> 07:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
Scully I'm the government Affairs
 
07:03:39.530 --> 07:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for Propane Gas Association of
 
07:03:41.930 --> 07:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
New England uh the letter that I
 
07:03:43.850 --> 07:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
distributed to you comes from Leslie
 
07:03:45.708 --> 07:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
Anderson she had a conflict she could
 
07:03:47.750 --> 07:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
not be here today she's actually in a
 
07:03:49.190 --> 07:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
propane meeting
 
07:03:49.200 --> 07:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
propane meeting
um

07:03:49.910 --> 07:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:53.510 --> 07:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
down in New Orleans so um I am not going
 
07:03:55.850 --> 07:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
to read this to you I'll try to recap it
 
07:03:57.830 --> 07:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
as best I can
 
07:04:01.730 --> 07:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
um if you take a look at this we are in
 
07:04:03.708 --> 07:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
opposition to the study don't usually
 
07:04:06.288 --> 07:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
say that but we think what our industry
 
07:04:08.270 --> 07:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
can do out there there's about 30
 
07:04:11.030 --> 07:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
different propane dealers in the state
 
07:04:13.490 --> 07:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire she has listed in other
 
07:04:16.010 --> 07:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
paragraph some of the uh charges that
 
07:04:17.930 --> 07:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
you might see or different charges that
 
07:04:20.690 --> 07:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
you might see for deliveries and storage
 
07:04:22.310 --> 07:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
07:04:24.948 --> 07:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
types of deliveries you get on volume so
 
07:04:27.948 --> 07:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
the prices will vary and then more
 
07:04:31.128 --> 07:04:31.138 align:start position:0%
importantly to the the issue that
 
07:04:34.368 --> 07:04:34.378 align:start position:0%
representative rung raised and in full
 
07:04:37.010 --> 07:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
disclosure I'm also from the town of
 
07:04:38.390 --> 07:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and a constituent a
 
07:04:39.708 --> 07:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
representative wrong I've known her for
 
07:04:42.170 --> 07:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
quite a while so we take this serious
 
07:04:42.180 --> 07:04:43.010 align:start position:0%
quite a while so we take this serious
um

07:04:43.010 --> 07:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:46.250 --> 07:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
so the last paragraph in here you'll see
 
07:04:49.190 --> 07:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
that um Leslie Anderson who is the
 
07:04:51.708 --> 07:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
president of P gain has offered to
 
07:04:53.390 --> 07:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
directly get involved
 
07:04:55.670 --> 07:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
with complaints for the consumers to get
 
07:04:56.930 --> 07:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
involved with the owners of these
 
07:04:59.510 --> 07:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
companies to help find a resolution
 
07:04:59.520 --> 07:05:00.110 align:start position:0%
companies to help find a resolution
um

07:05:00.110 --> 07:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:02.208 --> 07:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
to the question that representative munz
 
07:05:03.770 --> 07:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
asked earlier
 
07:05:05.750 --> 07:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
um every once in a while you have
 
07:05:07.070 --> 07:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
someone in the industry that causes
 
07:05:08.890 --> 07:05:08.900 align:start position:0%
problems for everybody
 
07:05:11.150 --> 07:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
so the answer to your question was yes
 
07:05:14.570 --> 07:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
from my perspective okay so we can help
 
07:05:17.570 --> 07:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
the previous president of uh P gain was
 
07:05:19.610 --> 07:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
Joe Rose and this is how he helped
 
07:05:21.948 --> 07:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
facilitate some of these problems the
 
07:05:24.070 --> 07:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
difference between propane and oil
 
07:05:27.410 --> 07:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
anybody can put oil in your tank
 
07:05:27.420 --> 07:05:28.010 align:start position:0%
anybody can put oil in your tank
um

07:05:28.010 --> 07:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:30.890 --> 07:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
but there is laws about propane and only
 
07:05:32.690 --> 07:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
the owner of that tank can move it and
 
07:05:34.070 --> 07:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's where some of these complications
 
07:05:36.830 --> 07:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
come from so I would offer to this
 
07:05:38.990 --> 07:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee that if you have constituents
 
07:05:40.548 --> 07:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
that are having or yourselves that are
 
07:05:42.830 --> 07:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
having propane problems um if you give
 
07:05:45.110 --> 07:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
Miss Anderson a call she will take care
 
07:05:47.868 --> 07:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
of that she's done it in the past
 
07:05:50.930 --> 07:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and and if this committee sees fit to
 
07:05:52.910 --> 07:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
move forward with the study committee
 
07:05:55.310 --> 07:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
which we don't see a need for that um
 
07:05:56.990 --> 07:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
then I will make some of our members
 
07:05:59.830 --> 07:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
available to you
 
07:06:02.090 --> 07:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay I think we're going to have a few
 
07:06:03.708 --> 07:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
questions for you and we'll start with
 
07:06:06.650 --> 07:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
07:06:08.510 --> 07:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
07:06:10.430 --> 07:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:06:13.910 --> 07:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm a bit I guess it might be just
 
07:06:15.530 --> 07:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
the wording or the tone of the wording
 
07:06:19.070 --> 07:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a bit taken back by in your
 
07:06:21.830 --> 07:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
Latin in the last paragraph here where
 
07:06:23.868 --> 07:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
it says that if if consumers do not like
 
07:06:25.548 --> 07:06:25.558 align:start position:0%
the charges on their build they can
 
07:06:28.430 --> 07:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
change companies uh that that's a little
 
07:06:31.670 --> 07:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
bit not very helpful I'm just kind of
 
07:06:34.990 --> 07:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:38.150 --> 07:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
why do you think that
 
07:06:41.810 --> 07:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
there is not a need for a study
 
07:06:45.650 --> 07:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
committee on this when we we see some
 
07:06:48.770 --> 07:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
some information like this uh it appears
 
07:06:50.930 --> 07:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
not to be very helpful to the consumer
 
07:06:54.110 --> 07:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
so why don't we need a study committee
 
07:06:56.350 --> 07:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
to see what's really going on here
 
07:06:58.968 --> 07:06:58.978 align:start position:0%
I think the members the 30 companies
 
07:07:01.788 --> 07:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
that sell propane in the State field of
 
07:07:03.350 --> 07:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
consumers can choose who they want to
 
07:07:05.330 --> 07:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
and if they're not happy with one you
 
07:07:07.070 --> 07:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
buy a car at a car dealership and if
 
07:07:08.330 --> 07:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
you're not happy with that car you can
 
07:07:10.070 --> 07:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
go elsewhere I think it's kind of it's
 
07:07:13.968 --> 07:07:13.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:17.208 --> 07:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
follow up um I don't think Leslie
 
07:07:19.128 --> 07:07:19.138 align:start position:0%
Anderson who drafted this was trying to
 
07:07:20.930 --> 07:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
be flippant with it I think she was
 
07:07:22.610 --> 07:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
trying to say the consumer ultimately
 
07:07:24.590 --> 07:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
can decide who they buy fuel for I think
 
07:07:25.930 --> 07:07:25.940 align:start position:0%
I have one follow-up
 
07:07:28.490 --> 07:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up so my follow-up question would
 
07:07:28.500 --> 07:07:31.610 align:start position:0%
follow-up so my follow-up question would
be

07:07:31.610 --> 07:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:34.128 --> 07:07:34.138 align:start position:0%
people are reticent to change when they
 
07:07:37.070 --> 07:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
don't really want to is there are there
 
07:07:39.770 --> 07:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
penalties for changing companies just
 
07:07:42.048 --> 07:07:42.058 align:start position:0%
because they don't like one uh what what
 
07:07:44.030 --> 07:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
are the ramifications if someone wants
 
07:07:46.250 --> 07:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
to change a propane company because they
 
07:07:48.708 --> 07:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
just don't happen to like one is your
 
07:07:51.110 --> 07:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
cost involved for them right there
 
07:07:52.670 --> 07:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
should not be most companies work
 
07:07:54.230 --> 07:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
together with each other when it goes
 
07:07:58.430 --> 07:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
from one provider to the next
 
07:08:01.610 --> 07:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
so if there is a problem here that like
 
07:08:03.110 --> 07:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative wrong described if
 
07:08:05.650 --> 07:08:05.660 align:start position:0%
there's our issue with the consumer
 
07:08:08.330 --> 07:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
these folks here at P gain are offering
 
07:08:09.530 --> 07:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
to help
 
07:08:12.650 --> 07:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:15.350 --> 07:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to car call on representative
 
07:08:17.690 --> 07:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
Bernardi in a in just a moment but first
 
07:08:20.150 --> 07:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
I have to make a comment here
 
07:08:23.150 --> 07:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
because as representative Doug Thomas
 
07:08:24.770 --> 07:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
points out
 
07:08:27.948 --> 07:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
the line that says if consumers do not
 
07:08:29.868 --> 07:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
like the charges on their bill they can
 
07:08:32.330 --> 07:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
change companies I happen to know that's
 
07:08:33.830 --> 07:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
not true
 
07:08:35.628 --> 07:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
my next door neighbor
 
07:08:38.270 --> 07:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
was a company it was a
 
07:08:41.330 --> 07:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
went with a company called AmeriGas and
 
07:08:43.610 --> 07:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
they had a thousand gallon tank that
 
07:08:46.910 --> 07:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
they put in their backyard the man who
 
07:08:49.128 --> 07:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
um installed the tank was the Builder
 
07:08:52.250 --> 07:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
and he owned the house lived in it with
 
07:08:54.110 --> 07:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
his family
 
07:08:56.750 --> 07:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
and after 10 or 12 years they decided
 
07:08:59.390 --> 07:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
they wanted to change companies
 
07:09:01.548 --> 07:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
because they found a supplier who would
 
07:09:04.670 --> 07:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
sell them propane for less money and our
 
07:09:06.830 --> 07:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas refused
 
07:09:06.840 --> 07:09:08.750 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas refused
to

07:09:08.750 --> 07:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:09:11.570 --> 07:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership of the tank to
 
07:09:13.490 --> 07:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
another company
 
07:09:16.850 --> 07:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
and they had to go round and round and
 
07:09:19.910 --> 07:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
round with AmeriGas and finally reached
 
07:09:22.788 --> 07:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
a resolution where they dug up the tank
 
07:09:25.070 --> 07:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
a thousand gallon tank it's a huge tank
 
07:09:27.890 --> 07:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
they dug it up in their backyard and
 
07:09:30.288 --> 07:09:30.298 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas came and got it and then they
 
07:09:34.448 --> 07:09:34.458 align:start position:0%
replaced the tank and changed companies
 
07:09:34.458 --> 07:09:36.410 align:start position:0%
replaced the tank and changed companies
that

07:09:36.410 --> 07:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:09:39.048 --> 07:09:39.058 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean it that they can just
 
07:09:41.868 --> 07:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
change companies without a huge hassle
 
07:09:45.590 --> 07:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so understood uh I realize that's
 
07:09:47.990 --> 07:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
not a question and I apologize but I
 
07:09:49.250 --> 07:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
just had to get that off my chest
 
07:09:51.590 --> 07:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
because my next door neighbor was was
 
07:09:53.270 --> 07:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
quite upset about it representative
 
07:09:57.230 --> 07:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:59.930 --> 07:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman Bose I I was going
 
07:10:02.990 --> 07:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
on exactly the same issue and I'll I'll
 
07:10:05.270 --> 07:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
relate my story I have a thousand gallon
 
07:10:08.270 --> 07:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
tank in my backyard that I put there uh
 
07:10:12.770 --> 07:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
22 years ago uh and uh in the in the
 
07:10:15.830 --> 07:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
plan it basically said you buy gas for
 
07:10:19.128 --> 07:10:19.138 align:start position:0%
us for 10 years you own the tank yet I
 
07:10:22.610 --> 07:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
kept getting fees up until two years ago
 
07:10:25.208 --> 07:10:25.218 align:start position:0%
and finally I just
 
07:10:28.250 --> 07:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
exploded with the company and said why
 
07:10:31.968 --> 07:10:31.978 align:start position:0%
am I paying Annual fees for a tank that
 
07:10:34.730 --> 07:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
nominally I oh paid for 10 years ago
 
07:10:37.610 --> 07:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
because I used gas from that tank and I
 
07:10:38.570 --> 07:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
had those
 
07:10:42.170 --> 07:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
nominal fill levels all all along so
 
07:10:45.590 --> 07:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
there appears to be an issue here that's
 
07:10:49.250 --> 07:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
beyond how it's being described and can
 
07:10:51.890 --> 07:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
be addressed and I I would what I would
 
07:10:55.070 --> 07:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
ask is why is it not appropriate then
 
07:10:57.650 --> 07:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
for you folks to hear these issues
 
07:10:59.510 --> 07:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
because I think the companies are going
 
07:11:01.128 --> 07:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
to have to come up with a change in the
 
07:11:03.590 --> 07:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
way they do business here or we change
 
07:11:05.868 --> 07:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
the law about how you can fill a tank
 
07:11:08.448 --> 07:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
and make it just like a an oil company
 
07:11:11.270 --> 07:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
can fill any tank you know if they have
 
07:11:13.670 --> 07:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate safety training you know I
 
07:11:16.070 --> 07:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what the issue is that
 
07:11:18.530 --> 07:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
requires the resolution but it's clearly
 
07:11:20.690 --> 07:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
not addressed here right representative
 
07:11:23.090 --> 07:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
for my edification what company was
 
07:11:23.100 --> 07:11:24.490 align:start position:0%
for my edification what company was
yours

07:11:24.490 --> 07:11:24.500 align:start position:0%
yours
 
07:11:28.430 --> 07:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh Northeast Utilities okay
 
07:11:35.090 --> 07:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:37.850 --> 07:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative berezny has a question
 
07:11:39.350 --> 07:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
07:11:40.730 --> 07:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:11:42.170 --> 07:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
um I understand you're coming out
 
07:11:43.850 --> 07:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
against this bill but if this bill were
 
07:11:46.070 --> 07:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
to pass are there any things you would
 
07:11:47.868 --> 07:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
like changed or any suggestions as far
 
07:11:50.330 --> 07:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
as the membership makeup or what the
 
07:11:52.430 --> 07:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
outcome of the of the bill or the report
 
07:11:54.890 --> 07:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh if the bill wasn't helpful with your
 
07:11:56.570 --> 07:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
with the committee's permission if the
 
07:11:58.128 --> 07:11:58.138 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass I would just I would
 
07:11:59.868 --> 07:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
make available to the committee for the
 
07:12:01.250 --> 07:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
study a couple of members from the
 
07:12:03.468 --> 07:12:03.478 align:start position:0%
propane industry to come and sit down
 
07:12:07.030 --> 07:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
while you folks have a work session
 
07:12:09.650 --> 07:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Wendy
 
07:12:11.930 --> 07:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question
 
07:12:13.070 --> 07:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
07:12:13.080 --> 07:12:14.030 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
um

07:12:14.030 --> 07:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:14.040 --> 07:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
um
to

07:12:15.830 --> 07:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:12:17.090 --> 07:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
I don't have
 
07:12:18.948 --> 07:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
probe trying to figure this one out so
 
07:12:21.310 --> 07:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
if you like representative
 
07:12:24.230 --> 07:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi he he has a tank
 
07:12:26.570 --> 07:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
and after 10 years he's supposed to own
 
07:12:26.580 --> 07:12:28.128 align:start position:0%
and after 10 years he's supposed to own
it

07:12:28.128 --> 07:12:28.138 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:12:31.850 --> 07:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
going on he's still paying a fee is that
 
07:12:34.548 --> 07:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
and if something happens to the tank
 
07:12:37.610 --> 07:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
it's not him who who does the repair
 
07:12:39.850 --> 07:12:39.860 align:start position:0%
correct it's the propane company
 
07:12:42.650 --> 07:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas I don't know the
 
07:12:44.030 --> 07:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
answer to that question because I don't
 
07:12:45.590 --> 07:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
know the relationship so I don't want to
 
07:12:47.510 --> 07:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
give you misinformation but I'd be happy
 
07:12:49.430 --> 07:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
to find that out for you I'm just
 
07:12:51.288 --> 07:12:51.298 align:start position:0%
wondering if this fee is considered
 
07:12:53.750 --> 07:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
almost an insurance fee as opposed to a
 
07:12:56.030 --> 07:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
rental fee I'm just I mean I I have two
 
07:12:58.070 --> 07:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
propane tanks in my house in Merrimack
 
07:12:59.390 --> 07:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
and if I have something go wrong they
 
07:13:02.150 --> 07:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
come and fix it but that's me okay thank
 
07:13:04.310 --> 07:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you representative
 
07:13:06.590 --> 07:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
Summers has a question thank you Mr
 
07:13:07.788 --> 07:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
07:13:10.850 --> 07:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
question mine granted I have issues with
 
07:13:12.830 --> 07:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
tanks as well but my question is about
 
07:13:17.208 --> 07:13:17.218 align:start position:0%
the volume of refill if I had an oil oil
 
07:13:20.330 --> 07:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
heat at home if I wanted 50 gallons 500
 
07:13:22.128 --> 07:13:22.138 align:start position:0%
gallons or a thousand gallons it'd be
 
07:13:23.570 --> 07:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
totally up to how much I wanted to put
 
07:13:26.390 --> 07:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
in but then propane it restricts you to
 
07:13:28.010 --> 07:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
where you have to fill at least 50
 
07:13:30.770 --> 07:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
percent of your tank nothing less and
 
07:13:32.930 --> 07:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
even if you don't have 50 available
 
07:13:34.670 --> 07:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to charge you fifty
 
07:13:36.288 --> 07:13:36.298 align:start position:0%
percent even if they can't even fit it
 
07:13:38.930 --> 07:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
in the tank why is this so and how is
 
07:13:40.548 --> 07:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
this legal
 
07:13:42.230 --> 07:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you for the
 
07:13:44.868 --> 07:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
question I um I I wish Miss Anderson was
 
07:13:46.670 --> 07:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
here so she could answer that I don't
 
07:13:49.070 --> 07:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
know what the relationship is and why
 
07:13:50.270 --> 07:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
you can have
 
07:13:52.490 --> 07:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
um different requirements and I'm happy
 
07:13:54.350 --> 07:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
to find out and bring that to you but I
 
07:13:56.390 --> 07:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
I don't want to misspeak and I have
 
07:13:59.270 --> 07:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
haffner's natural gas okay
 
07:14:01.968 --> 07:14:01.978 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
07:14:03.770 --> 07:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
07:14:06.048 --> 07:14:06.058 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned that
 
07:14:08.810 --> 07:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
you've had uh similar situations in the
 
07:14:10.548 --> 07:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
past with with companies that you've
 
07:14:12.890 --> 07:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
characterized as Bad actors or you know
 
07:14:14.570 --> 07:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
people who are not doing what they
 
07:14:16.910 --> 07:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
should do and that you facilitated
 
07:14:19.850 --> 07:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
agreements so I'm just curious do those
 
07:14:22.490 --> 07:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
agreements include restitution for the
 
07:14:25.670 --> 07:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
people involved for the clients
 
07:14:28.910 --> 07:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I know in the past that P gain
 
07:14:30.350 --> 07:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
um gentlemen it used to run his name was
 
07:14:32.150 --> 07:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
Joe Rose and Leslie Anderson has
 
07:14:34.250 --> 07:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
replaced him in the past when there were
 
07:14:35.690 --> 07:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
issues like this
 
07:14:37.670 --> 07:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
um they worked to rectify the problem to
 
07:14:40.128 --> 07:14:40.138 align:start position:0%
the consumer's satisfaction I would hope
 
07:14:40.138 --> 07:14:41.208 align:start position:0%
the consumer's satisfaction I would hope
so

07:14:41.208 --> 07:14:41.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:14:44.030 --> 07:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know at what point you know
 
07:14:46.070 --> 07:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
the you break off on a financial side
 
07:14:48.288 --> 07:14:48.298 align:start position:0%
but if you can't move a thousand gallon
 
07:14:48.298 --> 07:14:49.730 align:start position:0%
but if you can't move a thousand gallon
tank

07:14:49.730 --> 07:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
tank
 
07:14:51.650 --> 07:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
um that obviously that's a really big
 
07:14:54.948 --> 07:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
problem okay I recognize that and if
 
07:14:56.330 --> 07:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
07:14:58.910 --> 07:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know a hundred dollars and I don't
 
07:15:00.530 --> 07:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
know where that goes in relationship to
 
07:15:02.390 --> 07:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
what customers do for their consumers I
 
07:15:03.530 --> 07:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
would hope they'd take care of their
 
07:15:06.590 --> 07:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
Customer because if they don't then I
 
07:15:08.510 --> 07:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
think they have the you know they should
 
07:15:10.610 --> 07:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
have the ability I'll use that word to
 
07:15:12.890 --> 07:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
use somebody else so um I know that's
 
07:15:14.750 --> 07:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
not answering your question directly but
 
07:15:17.270 --> 07:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
I do believe that there are issues got
 
07:15:19.610 --> 07:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
rectified to their satisfaction in the
 
07:15:21.590 --> 07:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
past that's why she's offering to help
 
07:15:23.090 --> 07:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
with this now
 
07:15:26.150 --> 07:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
07:15:30.468 --> 07:15:30.478 align:start position:0%

company which may have be in the
 
07:15:38.990 --> 07:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
practice of buying up smaller companies
 
07:15:39.000 --> 07:15:40.430 align:start position:0%
practice of buying up smaller companies
in

07:15:40.430 --> 07:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:15:43.070 --> 07:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
in our region are they a member of
 
07:15:44.990 --> 07:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
propane gas Association of New England
 
07:15:46.490 --> 07:15:46.500 align:start position:0%

07:15:52.968 --> 07:15:52.978 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for
 
07:15:56.090 --> 07:15:56.100 align:start position:0%

you're welcome thank you
 
07:16:01.070 --> 07:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
um I I you know not not really a
 
07:16:02.390 --> 07:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
question but I guess the only thing that
 
07:16:06.170 --> 07:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
I would I would suggest is that um you
 
07:16:08.270 --> 07:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
probably have you know a couple bad
 
07:16:11.330 --> 07:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
apples and you know I think it's just
 
07:16:12.890 --> 07:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
important to get in front of that and
 
07:16:14.390 --> 07:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
try to address it as quickly as you can
 
07:16:16.910 --> 07:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
with with those individual companies
 
07:16:20.390 --> 07:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
happy to do our best representative
 
07:16:22.430 --> 07:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question
 
07:16:24.230 --> 07:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
07:16:26.868 --> 07:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in in this letter
 
07:16:30.530 --> 07:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
from Leslie Anderson uh it's it suggests
 
07:16:32.330 --> 07:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
if a customer is having difficulty with
 
07:16:34.490 --> 07:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
a particular company Etc reach out to
 
07:16:36.590 --> 07:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
our association and our association
 
07:16:39.110 --> 07:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
we'll do stuff
 
07:16:41.208 --> 07:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
do customers know this do we expect
 
07:16:43.430 --> 07:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
customers to know to do this is this
 
07:16:46.190 --> 07:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
included in billing information sent to
 
07:16:48.650 --> 07:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
customers no I don't think so and I'm I
 
07:16:50.868 --> 07:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
mean so
 
07:16:50.878 --> 07:16:53.030 align:start position:0%
mean so
yeah

07:16:53.030 --> 07:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:16:54.650 --> 07:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
when he gets to this level we're having
 
07:16:56.390 --> 07:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussions here it's obvious a problem
 
07:16:58.910 --> 07:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
out there so what we're offering or what
 
07:17:01.730 --> 07:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
they're offering to this committee is to
 
07:17:03.468 --> 07:17:03.478 align:start position:0%
assist in trying to make the problem go
 
07:17:05.330 --> 07:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
away as best they can
 
07:17:06.948 --> 07:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
um sounds like there are some greater
 
07:17:10.670 --> 07:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
problems it also to me sounds like
 
07:17:13.190 --> 07:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
um there is one deal that is more
 
07:17:15.530 --> 07:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
problematic than others okay and maybe
 
07:17:17.510 --> 07:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
if that one deal wasn't more problematic
 
07:17:19.430 --> 07:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be here today
 
07:17:22.250 --> 07:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
maybe I would but um
 
07:17:24.430 --> 07:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so representative
 
07:17:27.890 --> 07:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
07:17:29.628 --> 07:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair both and thank you
 
07:17:31.788 --> 07:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
07:17:33.650 --> 07:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
um you've referred that there have been
 
07:17:36.530 --> 07:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
problems in the past
 
07:17:36.540 --> 07:17:37.548 align:start position:0%
problems in the past
um

07:17:37.548 --> 07:17:37.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:17:40.128 --> 07:17:40.138 align:start position:0%
I would love to know when I this may be
 
07:17:42.948 --> 07:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical question I don't know
 
07:17:42.958 --> 07:17:43.968 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical question I don't know
um

07:17:43.968 --> 07:17:43.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:17:46.610 --> 07:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
compared to our other
 
07:17:48.530 --> 07:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
um energy suppliers that we've given
 
07:17:50.990 --> 07:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
monopolies to such as the oil and the
 
07:17:54.048 --> 07:17:54.058 align:start position:0%
natural gas uh any any energy supplier
 
07:17:57.110 --> 07:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
do you think that the uh
 
07:17:59.390 --> 07:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
number of incidences
 
07:18:01.788 --> 07:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
in the past where we've had difficult
 
07:18:04.610 --> 07:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
situations is greater within the propane
 
07:18:08.868 --> 07:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:12.048 --> 07:18:12.058 align:start position:0%
um probably not I mean uh
 
07:18:14.448 --> 07:18:14.458 align:start position:0%
the one reason is more difficult in the
 
07:18:16.310 --> 07:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
propane industry is because there is a
 
07:18:20.090 --> 07:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
law that requires that company to come
 
07:18:22.310 --> 07:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
get their tank and remove it's there for
 
07:18:25.610 --> 07:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
safety reasons oil doesn't have that
 
07:18:27.650 --> 07:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
and one quick thought about
 
07:18:29.208 --> 07:18:29.218 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
07:18:31.010 --> 07:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
and uh do you believe that a study
 
07:18:32.990 --> 07:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee could establish whether or not
 
07:18:35.570 --> 07:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
these uh artist aberrations that can be
 
07:18:37.010 --> 07:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
dealt with or whether or not it's
 
07:18:39.770 --> 07:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
endemic of uh a situation that requires
 
07:18:41.448 --> 07:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
07:18:44.330 --> 07:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I've been here for 34 years and after
 
07:18:45.890 --> 07:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
listening to this committee and the
 
07:18:48.650 --> 07:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
issues that are raised here I'm happy to
 
07:18:50.030 --> 07:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
work with the study committee if that's
 
07:18:51.288 --> 07:18:51.298 align:start position:0%
what you want to do
 
07:18:53.448 --> 07:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
thank you there you go
 
07:18:55.430 --> 07:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative closure did you have a
 
07:18:55.440 --> 07:18:57.048 align:start position:0%
representative closure did you have a
question

07:18:57.048 --> 07:18:57.058 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:18:59.448 --> 07:18:59.458 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Boltz
 
07:19:01.850 --> 07:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
um real quick I'm another one on this
 
07:19:05.208 --> 07:19:05.218 align:start position:0%
committee was issue with a propane
 
07:19:07.968 --> 07:19:07.978 align:start position:0%
dealer I don't need to go into it but
 
07:19:07.978 --> 07:19:08.930 align:start position:0%
dealer I don't need to go into it but
yes

07:19:08.930 --> 07:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:19:12.170 --> 07:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
it's easier just to pay to feed than the
 
07:19:15.770 --> 07:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:19.070 --> 07:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds ominous
 
07:19:20.868 --> 07:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative brezhny has another
 
07:19:23.150 --> 07:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman and thank
 
07:19:24.830 --> 07:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
07:19:27.530 --> 07:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
um in the testimony here it says for the
 
07:19:29.810 --> 07:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
organization for your organization it
 
07:19:31.430 --> 07:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
says we exist to serve the propane
 
07:19:33.548 --> 07:19:33.558 align:start position:0%
industry by promoting safety education
 
07:19:36.350 --> 07:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
and public awareness of the uses of
 
07:19:36.360 --> 07:19:37.730 align:start position:0%
and public awareness of the uses of
propane

07:19:37.730 --> 07:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
propane
 
07:19:40.730 --> 07:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
um for promoting is so does this
 
07:19:43.010 --> 07:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
organization not handle situations of
 
07:19:46.250 --> 07:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
like policy between the you mentioned
 
07:19:49.490 --> 07:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
um earlier that transferring tanks from
 
07:19:51.910 --> 07:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
one cut from one provider to another
 
07:19:54.708 --> 07:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
that each provider will will kind of
 
07:19:57.530 --> 07:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
negotiate amongst themselves is that a
 
07:19:59.628 --> 07:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
uniform process that an organization
 
07:20:02.510 --> 07:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
like this provides or how do they how is
 
07:20:04.368 --> 07:20:04.378 align:start position:0%
their consistency between
 
07:20:06.468 --> 07:20:06.478 align:start position:0%
different organizations trans so how
 
07:20:07.910 --> 07:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to work and how I do
 
07:20:10.310 --> 07:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
believe it works in most cases if I was
 
07:20:11.750 --> 07:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
07:20:14.390 --> 07:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
company X to go to company y those two
 
07:20:15.948 --> 07:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
companies would talk
 
07:20:18.890 --> 07:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
one would purchase what's left in a tank
 
07:20:21.468 --> 07:20:21.478 align:start position:0%
make restitution back to the to the
 
07:20:23.448 --> 07:20:23.458 align:start position:0%
other dealer or the homeowner and that's
 
07:20:25.670 --> 07:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
how this works it does work that way
 
07:20:28.368 --> 07:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
most of the time it gets magnified when
 
07:20:30.110 --> 07:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
we have issues now where we're dealing
 
07:20:33.530 --> 07:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
with it with the dealer okay
 
07:20:36.288 --> 07:20:36.298 align:start position:0%
um and uh that is
 
07:20:39.110 --> 07:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
that creates problems see once again oil
 
07:20:41.628 --> 07:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
is different oil anybody can put the oil
 
07:20:43.910 --> 07:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
in your tank okay they don't have that
 
07:20:46.548 --> 07:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
problem there so propane gets and has
 
07:20:48.468 --> 07:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
another step it was put there for safety
 
07:20:48.478 --> 07:20:49.490 align:start position:0%
another step it was put there for safety
reasons

07:20:49.490 --> 07:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
07:20:49.500 --> 07:20:50.090 align:start position:0%
reasons
um

07:20:50.090 --> 07:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:53.990 --> 07:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
and unless that part changes
 
07:20:57.110 --> 07:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
um you you can't go from Bob Scully
 
07:20:59.930 --> 07:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
propane company to representative Oaks
 
07:21:01.788 --> 07:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
propane company without
 
07:21:04.670 --> 07:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
working it out amongst the companies so
 
07:21:07.368 --> 07:21:07.378 align:start position:0%
when a company does not behave properly
 
07:21:09.048 --> 07:21:09.058 align:start position:0%
and do what they're supposed to do then
 
07:21:11.570 --> 07:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
we're here talking today but most of
 
07:21:15.948 --> 07:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:19.250 --> 07:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you uh just just to
 
07:21:20.810 --> 07:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
clarify my question so what I'm what I'm
 
07:21:23.868 --> 07:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
asking is does this organization provide
 
07:21:23.878 --> 07:21:25.128 align:start position:0%
asking is does this organization provide
some

07:21:25.128 --> 07:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
some
 
07:21:27.048 --> 07:21:27.058 align:start position:0%
sort of framework for all of these
 
07:21:28.430 --> 07:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
different companies or provide some
 
07:21:30.890 --> 07:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
policy or guidance on how to do some of
 
07:21:32.170 --> 07:21:32.180 align:start position:0%
those things where it's multiple
 
07:21:34.730 --> 07:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
organizations that interact with each
 
07:21:34.740 --> 07:21:35.990 align:start position:0%
organizations that interact with each
other

07:21:35.990 --> 07:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:21:38.390 --> 07:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
so the company Pro P gain will assist
 
07:21:40.010 --> 07:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
when there's problems like this I mean
 
07:21:41.208 --> 07:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
they have to be careful when they work
 
07:21:43.968 --> 07:21:43.978 align:start position:0%
together with you know with um when you
 
07:21:45.468 --> 07:21:45.478 align:start position:0%
start getting together and talking about
 
07:21:47.150 --> 07:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
money and stuff like that they have to
 
07:21:48.468 --> 07:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
be very careful
 
07:21:48.478 --> 07:21:49.250 align:start position:0%
be very careful
um

07:21:49.250 --> 07:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:51.170 --> 07:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
when so they have a board of directors
 
07:21:52.430 --> 07:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
that meets
 
07:21:54.170 --> 07:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine they discuss many
 
07:21:56.030 --> 07:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
things I think
 
07:21:57.708 --> 07:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
if they if I was to have those 30
 
07:21:59.628 --> 07:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
companies in a room here today or 30
 
07:22:01.968 --> 07:22:01.978 align:start position:0%
plus I would probably guess that 95 or
 
07:22:04.010 --> 07:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
99 of them would tell you that they do
 
07:22:06.350 --> 07:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
the way I explained it
 
07:22:06.360 --> 07:22:07.930 align:start position:0%
the way I explained it
um

07:22:07.930 --> 07:22:07.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:11.090 --> 07:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
so P gain I do not believe goes out
 
07:22:11.100 --> 07:22:12.110 align:start position:0%
so P gain I do not believe goes out
there

07:22:12.110 --> 07:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:22:15.288 --> 07:22:15.298 align:start position:0%
and and promotes all this they do this
 
07:22:16.910 --> 07:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
their companies do this and when their
 
07:22:19.070 --> 07:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
companies stub their toe they're
 
07:22:20.990 --> 07:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
offering to assist
 
07:22:23.090 --> 07:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if not answering your question
 
07:22:25.310 --> 07:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
the way correctly but that's
 
07:22:27.230 --> 07:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
what it is I think representative Doug
 
07:22:29.810 --> 07:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
Thomas has another question uh thank you
 
07:22:31.250 --> 07:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
07:22:33.590 --> 07:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
question just because you mentioned your
 
07:22:36.288 --> 07:22:36.298 align:start position:0%
shall I say time and Service uh with the
 
07:22:39.230 --> 07:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
association and everything
 
07:22:43.128 --> 07:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
can you relate on what you've heard here
 
07:22:43.138 --> 07:22:44.750 align:start position:0%
can you relate on what you've heard here
today

07:22:44.750 --> 07:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:22:47.868 --> 07:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
the issues that you're hearing can you
 
07:22:49.868 --> 07:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
relate to to
 
07:22:53.150 --> 07:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic post-pandemic uh
 
07:22:56.150 --> 07:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
pre-recession post recession have you
 
07:22:59.448 --> 07:22:59.458 align:start position:0%
heard of these issues before in your in
 
07:23:01.930 --> 07:23:01.940 align:start position:0%
your experience in your tenure here
 
07:23:04.788 --> 07:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
or is this something that is
 
07:23:07.070 --> 07:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden new and recent to you
 
07:23:09.410 --> 07:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
that would perk our ears up that would
 
07:23:13.010 --> 07:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:14.990 --> 07:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
I do not believe the issue that we're
 
07:23:16.788 --> 07:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
talking about today has anything to do
 
07:23:18.708 --> 07:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic
 
07:23:22.010 --> 07:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:22.020 --> 07:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:23:23.510 --> 07:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:23:25.788 --> 07:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
um I've already testified on behalf of
 
07:23:27.170 --> 07:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
the folks that I represent that they'd
 
07:23:28.788 --> 07:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
prefer not to have the study because
 
07:23:30.170 --> 07:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
they think they can resolve the problem
 
07:23:33.230 --> 07:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
but I've heard multiple
 
07:23:35.030 --> 07:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
personal stories here around the table
 
07:23:37.250 --> 07:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
what's going on so I am happy to bring
 
07:23:39.948 --> 07:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
if this is what the committee wants um
 
07:23:39.958 --> 07:23:41.628 align:start position:0%
if this is what the committee wants um
owners

07:23:41.628 --> 07:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
owners
 
07:23:44.990 --> 07:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
not from AmeriGas to this table here
 
07:23:47.750 --> 07:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay to talk about how and they can
 
07:23:49.190 --> 07:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
answer some of these questions more
 
07:23:51.410 --> 07:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
specifically I wish Miss Anderson was
 
07:23:53.270 --> 07:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
here because she worked for Dead River
 
07:23:55.730 --> 07:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
right at his job so she understands
 
07:23:58.010 --> 07:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
these things better than I do
 
07:23:58.020 --> 07:23:58.730 align:start position:0%
these things better than I do
um

07:23:58.730 --> 07:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:24:01.490 --> 07:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
but that's how I would bring a couple of
 
07:24:04.070 --> 07:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
members here a couple of owners that
 
07:24:05.810 --> 07:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
understand how this works if you do this
 
07:24:07.368 --> 07:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
I mean then I guess you can decide later
 
07:24:09.770 --> 07:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
on if you want legislation or not I
 
07:24:12.650 --> 07:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
think the industry prefers not to have
 
07:24:12.660 --> 07:24:13.548 align:start position:0%
think the industry prefers not to have
that

07:24:13.548 --> 07:24:13.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:24:15.530 --> 07:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
um but you know maybe it has to have the
 
07:24:18.610 --> 07:24:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:20.810 --> 07:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thought of
 
07:24:22.610 --> 07:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
another question
 
07:24:24.288 --> 07:24:24.298 align:start position:0%
um thank you this is actually a question
 
07:24:26.208 --> 07:24:26.218 align:start position:0%
for the committee we've been hearing a
 
07:24:28.610 --> 07:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
lot of stories of displeasure with uh
 
07:24:30.708 --> 07:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
propane is there anyone on the committee
 
07:24:33.530 --> 07:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
that has propane that is pleased with
 
07:24:35.930 --> 07:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
what they have
 
07:24:38.270 --> 07:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you I just wanted
 
07:24:42.048 --> 07:24:42.058 align:start position:0%
to know I would say overall I'm pleased
 
07:24:45.310 --> 07:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
with propane as my as my heating fuel
 
07:24:48.890 --> 07:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
but I have had a few problems myself and
 
07:24:50.690 --> 07:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
I've heard from constituents and
 
07:24:53.448 --> 07:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
neighbors of problems so
 
07:24:56.090 --> 07:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I'd be inclined to think that some
 
07:24:58.930 --> 07:24:58.940 align:start position:0%
action is necessary
 
07:25:01.548 --> 07:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds actually had a
 
07:25:03.890 --> 07:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
question first
 
07:25:06.110 --> 07:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and I'm trying
 
07:25:08.510 --> 07:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
to be helpful here did you mean to say
 
07:25:11.628 --> 07:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
that perhaps
 
07:25:16.670 --> 07:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
the reason that the members of uh P gain
 
07:25:19.250 --> 07:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
do not have
 
07:25:23.090 --> 07:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
that that harmonization of of consumer
 
07:25:23.100 --> 07:25:24.288 align:start position:0%
that that harmonization of of consumer
practices

07:25:24.288 --> 07:25:24.298 align:start position:0%
practices
 
07:25:27.590 --> 07:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
is not one of the functions of P gain
 
07:25:31.250 --> 07:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
and that that the reason that's not is
 
07:25:33.530 --> 07:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
because you might be accused of
 
07:25:35.930 --> 07:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
collusion if you if you got together and
 
07:25:38.030 --> 07:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
talked about harmonizing the practices
 
07:25:40.010 --> 07:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
well not to practice as if it gets down
 
07:25:42.410 --> 07:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
to money it could be but I I don't want
 
07:25:44.990 --> 07:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
to say that they don't talk I mean I
 
07:25:46.850 --> 07:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
think the question was do they
 
07:25:48.650 --> 07:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
is this something that they go down and
 
07:25:50.628 --> 07:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
talk about to try to set up together and
 
07:25:52.070 --> 07:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
how they work together I believe that's
 
07:25:54.170 --> 07:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
just what they do already they should be
 
07:25:55.430 --> 07:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
07:25:57.230 --> 07:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
so if I had someone from White Mountain
 
07:26:00.350 --> 07:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
Oil here or Palmer Gas and Oil here or
 
07:26:04.190 --> 07:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
die for shard or City Fuel
 
07:26:06.350 --> 07:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
or McLaughlin or any of these people
 
07:26:08.868 --> 07:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
that offer both products I believe they
 
07:26:10.310 --> 07:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
would all tell you
 
07:26:12.468 --> 07:26:12.478 align:start position:0%
that this is what they this is what they
 
07:26:14.868 --> 07:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
do this is their business practice
 
07:26:17.330 --> 07:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
could I follow up question yes follow-up
 
07:26:22.368 --> 07:26:22.378 align:start position:0%
I mean might it might it be that a study
 
07:26:24.830 --> 07:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
commission which is all this legislation
 
07:26:28.070 --> 07:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
is doing might it be that a study
 
07:26:31.070 --> 07:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
commission could provide a helpful venue
 
07:26:33.830 --> 07:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
a helpful forum for the the good actor
 
07:26:37.610 --> 07:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
companies to share and come up with you
 
07:26:39.590 --> 07:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
know good a set of good consumer
 
07:26:41.270 --> 07:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
practices that the industry would abide
 
07:26:43.368 --> 07:26:43.378 align:start position:0%
by it might
 
07:26:46.070 --> 07:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:26:49.490 --> 07:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
so representative Nancy Murphy would
 
07:26:52.190 --> 07:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
also like to testify so
 
07:26:55.610 --> 07:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
um let's give her that opportunity and I
 
07:26:57.770 --> 07:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr sculling for being here
 
07:26:57.780 --> 07:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr sculling for being here
today

07:26:59.750 --> 07:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:27:04.128 --> 07:27:04.138 align:start position:0%
representative welcome to sdne oh
 
07:27:06.110 --> 07:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vose and I will be
 
07:27:08.390 --> 07:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
very brief because most of my points
 
07:27:10.430 --> 07:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
have been raised I just wanted to
 
07:27:12.110 --> 07:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
address both the change provider
 
07:27:15.350 --> 07:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
response and the offer of the propane
 
07:27:17.150 --> 07:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
providers to be available to address the
 
07:27:17.160 --> 07:27:18.590 align:start position:0%
providers to be available to address the
concerns

07:27:18.590 --> 07:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
07:27:20.868 --> 07:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
I think it's clear based on some
 
07:27:22.968 --> 07:27:22.978 align:start position:0%
people's experiences here as well as the
 
07:27:25.250 --> 07:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
testimony that was submitted that these
 
07:27:27.170 --> 07:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
concerns have been brought to these
 
07:27:29.510 --> 07:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
propane companies in the past and remain
 
07:27:29.520 --> 07:27:31.070 align:start position:0%
propane companies in the past and remain
unaddressed

07:27:31.070 --> 07:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
unaddressed
 
07:27:32.868 --> 07:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
um it's disappointing to me that the
 
07:27:35.510 --> 07:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
propane companies recognizing that would
 
07:27:38.690 --> 07:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
not support a a commission or committee
 
07:27:40.490 --> 07:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
to take a look and see how they can come
 
07:27:42.890 --> 07:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
together and offer
 
07:27:45.490 --> 07:27:45.500 align:start position:0%
um services to New Hampshire citizens
 
07:27:48.830 --> 07:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
that are not as conflicted and
 
07:27:51.890 --> 07:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
um uh challenging as as they are right
 
07:27:51.900 --> 07:27:52.788 align:start position:0%
um uh challenging as as they are right
now

07:27:52.788 --> 07:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:27:54.468 --> 07:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
um you know we see that you know
 
07:27:57.288 --> 07:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
challenges of making that change happen
 
07:27:59.570 --> 07:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
I my mother was 95 I know when she went
 
07:28:00.650 --> 07:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
through this and it was not with
 
07:28:00.660 --> 07:28:02.270 align:start position:0%
through this and it was not with
AmeriGas

07:28:02.270 --> 07:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas
 
07:28:06.048 --> 07:28:06.058 align:start position:0%
um and uh just trying to get a propane
 
07:28:08.868 --> 07:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
tank switched trying to get reimbursed
 
07:28:11.570 --> 07:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
for what was in the tank when you're 95
 
07:28:13.788 --> 07:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
almost 60 96 years old it's really hard
 
07:28:16.070 --> 07:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
to make those multiple phone calls and
 
07:28:17.570 --> 07:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
so I just think of our senior citizens
 
07:28:19.910 --> 07:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
that are living in homes and one more
 
07:28:22.010 --> 07:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
aggravation anyway I it makes sense to
 
07:28:23.448 --> 07:28:23.458 align:start position:0%
me that the propane companies would
 
07:28:24.890 --> 07:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
rather not have the involvement of a
 
07:28:26.690 --> 07:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
study committee on one sense but I think
 
07:28:28.730 --> 07:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
the testimony uh provided and the
 
07:28:30.410 --> 07:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
committee's own remarks seems to
 
07:28:32.810 --> 07:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
indicate how necessary it really is
 
07:28:34.010 --> 07:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to be able to assess
 
07:28:36.468 --> 07:28:36.478 align:start position:0%
both the types of concerns that citizens
 
07:28:39.230 --> 07:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
have across the board as well as whether
 
07:28:40.910 --> 07:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
there are just specifics to to certain
 
07:28:43.610 --> 07:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
companies and uh on that I just ask that
 
07:28:47.448 --> 07:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
you vote OTP on hb81 thank you
 
07:28:49.310 --> 07:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate you coming and
 
07:28:51.110 --> 07:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
talking to us thanks so much anybody
 
07:28:52.490 --> 07:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
have any questions for the
 
07:28:52.500 --> 07:28:54.948 align:start position:0%
have any questions for the
representative

07:28:54.948 --> 07:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:28:58.850 --> 07:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you uh we
 
07:29:00.468 --> 07:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
have no more pink cards so there will be
 
07:29:03.530 --> 07:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
no more testimony offered on this uh
 
07:29:06.650 --> 07:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
07:29:09.350 --> 07:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
we spoke earlier today or maybe it was
 
07:29:10.788 --> 07:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
yesterday I can't remember about
 
07:29:10.798 --> 07:29:13.968 align:start position:0%
yesterday I can't remember about
subcommittees

07:29:13.968 --> 07:29:13.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:16.490 --> 07:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
this bill appears to me to be an ideal
 
07:29:20.628 --> 07:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:23.628 --> 07:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
is there anybody in attendance by show
 
07:29:26.090 --> 07:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
of hands who would be willing to serve
 
07:29:29.208 --> 07:29:29.218 align:start position:0%
on a subcommittee to do more study on
 
07:29:31.128 --> 07:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:29:34.368 --> 07:29:34.378 align:start position:0%
I see one two
 
07:29:34.378 --> 07:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
I see one two
three

07:29:35.990 --> 07:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
07:29:36.000 --> 07:29:36.610 align:start position:0%
three
four

07:29:36.610 --> 07:29:36.620 align:start position:0%
four
 
07:29:39.830 --> 07:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
five so I think we have plenty of people
 
07:29:42.410 --> 07:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
here who are interested in
 
07:29:45.288 --> 07:29:45.298 align:start position:0%
studying this bill further so this is
 
07:29:48.770 --> 07:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
not an early Bill we don't have to
 
07:29:51.170 --> 07:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
exec it until probably the middle of
 
07:29:53.690 --> 07:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
March so that gives us
 
07:29:57.590 --> 07:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much a a month to five weeks to
 
07:30:01.368 --> 07:30:01.378 align:start position:0%
look into this and I'm going to urge the
 
07:30:03.468 --> 07:30:03.478 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
07:30:07.250 --> 07:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
to not only examine the question of
 
07:30:09.530 --> 07:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
whether a study commission or a study
 
07:30:11.810 --> 07:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
committee is appropriate
 
07:30:11.820 --> 07:30:13.670 align:start position:0%
committee is appropriate
but

07:30:13.670 --> 07:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:30:15.890 --> 07:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
whether or not it might be appropriate
 
07:30:18.410 --> 07:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
to propose some other legislation
 
07:30:20.930 --> 07:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
to deal with this issue now if the
 
07:30:22.910 --> 07:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee does propose additional
 
07:30:25.070 --> 07:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
legislation we would have to have
 
07:30:27.410 --> 07:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
another public hearing to discuss that
 
07:30:27.420 --> 07:30:29.750 align:start position:0%
another public hearing to discuss that
legislation

07:30:29.750 --> 07:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:30:29.760 --> 07:30:31.190 align:start position:0%
legislation
nevertheless

07:30:31.190 --> 07:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
07:30:34.128 --> 07:30:34.138 align:start position:0%
I would encourage the subcommittee to at
 
07:30:36.830 --> 07:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
least consider whether other legislation
 
07:30:39.770 --> 07:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate but beyond a study
 
07:30:41.930 --> 07:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
committee or in addition to a study
 
07:30:44.030 --> 07:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee or in place of a study
 
07:30:44.040 --> 07:30:45.288 align:start position:0%
committee or in place of a study
committee

07:30:45.288 --> 07:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:30:47.990 --> 07:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative partial
 
07:30:49.850 --> 07:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair Volks a questionable
 
07:30:51.650 --> 07:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
procedure on that
 
07:30:54.110 --> 07:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
um could we solicit a friendly Amendment
 
07:30:56.750 --> 07:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
to the existing Bill if we wanted to
 
07:30:59.330 --> 07:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
make some changes
 
07:30:59.340 --> 07:31:00.770 align:start position:0%
make some changes
certainly

07:31:00.770 --> 07:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
07:31:02.990 --> 07:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
and the study committee could feel free
 
07:31:06.830 --> 07:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
to request the attendance of of other
 
07:31:08.510 --> 07:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
persons to
 
07:31:10.610 --> 07:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
provide additional testimony and
 
07:31:13.548 --> 07:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
information on the question so for
 
07:31:17.330 --> 07:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
example if Leslie Anderson might be
 
07:31:17.340 --> 07:31:19.910 align:start position:0%
example if Leslie Anderson might be
available

07:31:19.910 --> 07:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:22.490 --> 07:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
um subsequent to today maybe she could
 
07:31:24.048 --> 07:31:24.058 align:start position:0%
come in and talk to the committee maybe
 
07:31:27.048 --> 07:31:27.058 align:start position:0%
you could invite members of
 
07:31:29.510 --> 07:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
the the other members of the industry to
 
07:31:30.650 --> 07:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
come in
 
07:31:34.548 --> 07:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
um CEOs or operations managers of
 
07:31:36.530 --> 07:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
propane companies
 
07:31:38.390 --> 07:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the subcommittee decides it
 
07:31:40.190 --> 07:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
needs to do to gather appropriate
 
07:31:43.310 --> 07:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
information would be
 
07:31:46.430 --> 07:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
worthwhile and and the way to go so
 
07:31:48.708 --> 07:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative Summers representative
 
07:31:51.128 --> 07:31:51.138 align:start position:0%
partial representative Doug Thomas
 
07:31:53.390 --> 07:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi and
 
07:31:55.368 --> 07:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
representative closure expressed
 
07:31:58.090 --> 07:31:58.100 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in being on this
 
07:31:58.100 --> 07:31:59.628 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in being on this
subcommittee

07:31:59.628 --> 07:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
07:31:59.638 --> 07:32:01.070 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
so

07:32:01.070 --> 07:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:32:03.048 --> 07:32:03.058 align:start position:0%
um I will ask representative Doug Thomas
 
07:32:05.628 --> 07:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
to be the chair of the subcommittee and
 
07:32:07.850 --> 07:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
he will call the first meeting and
 
07:32:09.170 --> 07:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
notify the other members of the
 
07:32:13.610 --> 07:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:16.610 --> 07:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
and the clerk will record all this
 
07:32:18.350 --> 07:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
information so that we won't forget it
 
07:32:18.360 --> 07:32:19.850 align:start position:0%
information so that we won't forget it
later

07:32:19.850 --> 07:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
later
 
07:32:21.650 --> 07:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative naughter
 
07:32:23.390 --> 07:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
07:32:26.448 --> 07:32:26.458 align:start position:0%
say that I was writing things down and I
 
07:32:28.070 --> 07:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
wrote down and what's exactly what you
 
07:32:30.708 --> 07:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
said that my notes are a little
 
07:32:32.330 --> 07:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
different I said the purpose of a study
 
07:32:35.570 --> 07:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
is to recommend legislation farther down
 
07:32:37.128 --> 07:32:37.138 align:start position:0%
the road and it sounds like the problem
 
07:32:38.990 --> 07:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
is already known I wrote down the
 
07:32:41.448 --> 07:32:41.458 align:start position:0%
problem is customer service so that
 
07:32:44.208 --> 07:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
would be the focus of the subcommittee
 
07:32:46.490 --> 07:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
is what they can do to
 
07:32:48.048 --> 07:32:48.058 align:start position:0%
make these companies improve their
 
07:32:50.990 --> 07:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:53.270 --> 07:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative closure you had a
 
07:32:53.280 --> 07:32:54.590 align:start position:0%
okay representative closure you had a
comment

07:32:54.590 --> 07:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
comment
 
07:32:57.410 --> 07:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman both I'm sorry just
 
07:32:59.270 --> 07:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
got back but I picked up on the end of
 
07:33:02.150 --> 07:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
it because I had made a note that I did
 
07:33:02.160 --> 07:33:03.530 align:start position:0%
it because I had made a note that I did
not

07:33:03.530 --> 07:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:33:06.350 --> 07:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I am not looking for more
 
07:33:06.360 --> 07:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
and I am not looking for more
regulations

07:33:09.830 --> 07:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:12.530 --> 07:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine
 
07:33:15.070 --> 07:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
um representative Thomas Doug Thomas
 
07:33:18.048 --> 07:33:18.058 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you Mr chair that's
 
07:33:21.530 --> 07:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
exactly my point to uh preeminate uh
 
07:33:23.510 --> 07:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Winnie's Thomas potential
 
07:33:25.690 --> 07:33:25.700 align:start position:0%
question for the record it's
 
07:33:27.830 --> 07:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas that would be
 
07:33:30.708 --> 07:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
the chair of the subcommittee
 
07:33:34.190 --> 07:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
did I not specify that I apologize uh I
 
07:33:36.548 --> 07:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
wrote Doug Thomas okay good
 
07:33:40.250 --> 07:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:42.530 --> 07:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to be doing this dance
 
07:33:45.590 --> 07:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:46.910 --> 07:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
s thank you chair
 
07:33:46.920 --> 07:33:48.350 align:start position:0%
s thank you chair
um

07:33:48.350 --> 07:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:52.010 --> 07:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
I could conceivably believe that the
 
07:33:54.230 --> 07:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
scope of this subcommittee
 
07:33:57.830 --> 07:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
would go beyond consumer
 
07:33:57.840 --> 07:33:58.730 align:start position:0%
would go beyond consumer
um

07:33:58.730 --> 07:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:58.740 --> 07:34:00.048 align:start position:0%
um
service

07:34:00.048 --> 07:34:00.058 align:start position:0%
service
 
07:34:02.390 --> 07:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
and there are other questions that I
 
07:34:04.430 --> 07:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
would have asked today that I
 
07:34:06.288 --> 07:34:06.298 align:start position:0%
I think I can find out on my own but I
 
07:34:08.390 --> 07:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
think that they made their examination
 
07:34:10.548 --> 07:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
the um
 
07:34:13.730 --> 07:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh depreciation on these gas tanks is
 
07:34:15.410 --> 07:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
something that concerns me
 
07:34:15.420 --> 07:34:16.730 align:start position:0%
something that concerns me
uh

07:34:16.730 --> 07:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:34:20.150 --> 07:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
and I would also add that I think that
 
07:34:22.430 --> 07:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
while I don't like more regulation
 
07:34:24.350 --> 07:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
myself I think having appropriate
 
07:34:26.030 --> 07:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
regulation and safeguards protect the
 
07:34:29.510 --> 07:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
consumers and our uh
 
07:34:31.310 --> 07:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
our economy
 
07:34:33.468 --> 07:34:33.478 align:start position:0%
if it's relevant we need to go ahead and
 
07:34:35.208 --> 07:34:35.218 align:start position:0%
do that I don't think this is time to
 
07:34:36.468 --> 07:34:36.478 align:start position:0%
have a full discussion of it by the way
 
07:34:38.690 --> 07:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
should I do and I apologize for opening
 
07:34:40.070 --> 07:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
the door on that
 
07:34:42.048 --> 07:34:42.058 align:start position:0%
yes thank you let's wait until the
 
07:34:43.968 --> 07:34:43.978 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meets to start those
 
07:34:47.750 --> 07:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
conversations I think we've done Justice
 
07:34:49.910 --> 07:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
to this bill here this afternoon with
 
07:34:51.890 --> 07:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
this public hearing so I'm going to
 
07:34:53.570 --> 07:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
close this public hearing and ask
 
07:34:55.610 --> 07:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative closure to give us an
 
07:34:57.410 --> 07:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
indication of what the blue sheet says
 
07:34:59.030 --> 07:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
about it
 
07:35:02.628 --> 07:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
House Bill 81 and the blue sheet it was
 
07:35:06.650 --> 07:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
five in favor is none against
 
07:35:11.750 --> 07:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
online it was two in favor one against
 
07:35:14.990 --> 07:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay appreciate it
 
07:35:16.788 --> 07:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
