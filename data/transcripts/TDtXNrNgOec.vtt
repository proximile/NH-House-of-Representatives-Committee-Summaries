00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
the governor and so we think this is by

01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
bailed seems like it would go up a bit
 

01:20:42.159 --> 01:20:46.030 align:start position:0%
bailed seems like it would go up a bit
because<01:20:42.840><c> of</c><01:20:43.280><c> this</c><01:20:43.639><c> these</c><01:20:44.120><c> this</c><01:20:45.040><c> legislation</c>

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
because of this these this legislation
 

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.750 align:start position:0%
because of this these this legislation
so<01:20:46.280><c> therefore</c><01:20:46.679><c> if</c><01:20:46.840><c> more</c><01:20:47.120><c> people</c><01:20:47.400><c> are</c><01:20:47.600><c> in</c><01:20:47.840><c> jail</c>

01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
so therefore if more people are in jail
 

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.870 align:start position:0%
so therefore if more people are in jail
jail<01:20:49.120><c> is</c><01:20:49.320><c> more</c><01:20:49.600><c> expensive</c><01:20:50.120><c> than</c><01:20:50.320><c> bail</c><01:20:50.719><c> so</c>

01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
jail is more expensive than bail so
 

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.189 align:start position:0%
jail is more expensive than bail so
there<01:20:50.960><c> might</c><01:20:51.159><c> be</c><01:20:51.320><c> more</c><01:20:51.679><c> costs</c><01:20:52.360><c> involved</c><01:20:53.199><c> there</c>

01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
there might be more costs involved there
 

01:20:54.199 --> 01:20:55.590 align:start position:0%
