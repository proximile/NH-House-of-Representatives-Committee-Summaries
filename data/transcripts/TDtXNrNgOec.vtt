the Green
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
Sheet all right right so um I think
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
we're awaiting an amendment on 318 which
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
was the first bill on our schedule today
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
but we'll come back to that when the am
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
when the amendment is available I'll
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
leean thank you Mr chairman House Bill
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
10:05 relative to judicial training I'd
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
like to recognize representative Maguire
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
itl

00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
motion of second for itl Is there
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill should I
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
explain go ahead so um this bill has
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
been completely uh included in what
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
we'll see in a house bill
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
318 the sponsor of this bill is upset
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
because because it's becoming itl and
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
and she's worried that if 318 doesn't
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
pass then this this policy will not
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
happen but in our
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
you the reverse is more likely that that
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
that as a separate bill this policy is
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
less attractive than the bail reform
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
policy is to both us and the Senate and
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
the governor and so we think this is by
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
including this in 318 it's more likely
 
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
to happen and more likely to happen
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
quickly so this bill is now
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary further
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
discussion repres on a hold thank you Mr
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%

rather than if we if we we could have
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
used this bill as the vehicle but then
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
it would have been just Committee of
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
conference type stuff so so this way
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's it'll be the house bill that
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
becomes the final bill so I'm moving
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
itl motion for Senate Bill 252 is
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate further

cells thank you Mr chair I'd like to
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
move House Bill
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.710 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
discussion comments repres represent
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you so the amendment
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
actually has my name on it so I probably
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
should talk about it um it so this bill
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
um came this is a bill to uh
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
allow the uh digital images captured by
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
the new style of voting machines which I
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
believe four Towns now have um to be
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
viewed by members of the public and so
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
um the the main problem with the
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
original bill is that it had
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
um it it had a significant cost because
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
the way the viewing was imagined was
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
that an employee of the secretary of
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
state would conduct sort of viewing
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
sessions and any interested people could
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
come to the viewing session and they
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
would display it and so on so it
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
required an employee
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment removes the cost from
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
the bill and it it it just um
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
allows uh towns which is where the data
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
is to sell copies of those images to
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants them for their costs so
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
so there's no more you know viewing
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
sessions no more extra employee and and
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
therefore no more
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
cost thank you further discussion
 
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
representative able yes thank you very
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair I'll be supporting the
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendment but I'll be voting um against
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended I did have an
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with uh our deput
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state this morning
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
about the amendment um their office
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
continues to appros hb1
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
1577 for uh the reasons that we heard in
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
the division one of which is that that
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're uh continue to be concerned
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
about potential vote buying schemes um
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
that could stem from the viewing of the
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
ballots because they're concerned that
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
the ballots could be marked in some way
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
to indicate to somebody whether somebody
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
voted the way they wanted them to and
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
the other thing that they mentioned um
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the division that they continue to be
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about is the privacy of uh
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
folks using the um accessibility
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
machines so um for that reason there
 
00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
were SE several others um I I'll be
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment but opposing
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you representative
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
hle thank you Mr Speaker um the concerns
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
regarding buying votes are probably
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
overstated today everybody walks around
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
with a a portable cell phone with a
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
camera and can easily take an image they
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
can take an image even including their
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
driver's license if necessary to show
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
evidence that they have voted a certain
 
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
way vote buying is illegal it's already
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited by Statute either we believe
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
that statute works or we don't if
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to do it today the means
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
exist today this just allows everybody
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
else to verify the counts and to make
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
sure their vote was in the list of
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
ballots that was counted I think we all
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
should support this thank
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%

Amendment passed out for House Bill
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
1589 which is the next one once you have
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
it in place I'll ask representative
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
Maguire to introduce the
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
amendment uh yes uh thank you Mr
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll I'll move ought to pass
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
1396 so um this bill creates uh uh
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
veterans courts which are similar to
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
drug courts um the numbers we got from
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
it was that the estimate was maybe um 26
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
27 individuals a year would would end up
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
using them um and so we used as kind of
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
a you know an upper limit uh the number
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
of 40 and the way the the original bill
 
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
was written was the cost was going to be
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
a flat two million dollars a year of
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
payments from the state to
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
counties um
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
Modified by the size of the county so
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
the smallest counties would get the
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
least and the biggest counties would get
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
the most but it was still I mean $2
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
million a year for for um 40 cases Max
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
we thought was was way Overkill so so
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is instead
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
substitutes a a kind of carrot for the
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
counties to implement veterans courts of
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
$5,000 per case and and it also includes
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
a maximum of um uh well it would be a
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
maximum of $200,000 a year there is also
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
an employee here I believe which is a
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a veterans court um uh
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
administrator of some kind so um so the
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
total cost in this bill is
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
163,000 but that's because it's a half
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
years's amount so um the the you know if
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
only 26 cases a year then the the cost
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
would go down
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
correspondingly Motion in a second on
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%

representative grassy is correct we
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
pretty much stuck with the U version
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
that came out of the Commerce Committee
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
I know you all were aware of a lot of
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
back and forth and suggestions that uh
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
we accept some language that was
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
suggested to us by a member of the
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
Senate but we did stick with the house
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
version the key issues that we added or
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
if you will changed uh the fiscal
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
committee will have General oversight of
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
funds and finally all funds received by
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis commission will go to the
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
general funds we don't anticipate any
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
funds from this passage of this bill for
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
at least two years so I think that
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much covers it Mr chairman and it
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
was a 10% on it rather than 12 and a
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
half that's correct
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
available and we'll move on to division
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
two and I recognize representative Emer
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
1202 thank you Mr chair House Bill 1202
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
is relative to the issuance of permits
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
for the alteration of driveways exist
 
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:56.599 align:start position:0%
exiting onto public ways and since my
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
running back isn't there I'll keep the
 
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.069 align:start position:0%
running back isn't there I'll keep the
ball

00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
ball
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
myself uh Department of Transportation
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
came to us uh with a a plea because the
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
idea is that uh curb cuts on state roads
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
are taking exceptionally long time to
 
00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:15.030 align:start position:0%
are taking exceptionally long time to
get

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
approved idea behind a more rapid
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
approval is if a developer is putting in
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
apartment building we want to get it
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
approved so we can have additional
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
Living Spaces as soon as
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
possible uh I I think the the uh
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation kind of put
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
a rope around their neck they asked for
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
three additional
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
people uh and we agreed but they if if
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
it is not done in a timely fashion the
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
curb cut is approved without Department
 
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.349 align:start position:0%
curb cut is approved without Department
of

00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation U that that's where we
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
are and and we supported it so hopefully
 
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
amendment goes the committee in an
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
amendment right I don't
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
was hack and Phillips yeah there was an
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
amendment it was
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
um 20 I'm sorry 202 24-
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
0945 um repres representative Alexander
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored or I guess sponsored it um
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
so it was just a small change my
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
understanding um it was a technical
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
change referencing the correct paragraph
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh which was incorrectly mentioned
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
before so um it was a minor adjustment
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
and I think the committee 90 voted to
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
approve it okay who can we put down from
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
the committee that uh that made the
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%

representative Emer thank you Mr chair
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
relative to the per pupil cost of an
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education uh
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment on here it was my
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'm withdrawing the
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
amendment uh so we don't need to worry
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
about it and so uh House Bill 1583 will
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
is submitted as passed by the house this
 
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
changed the adequacy to
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
$44 plus it had some uh language that
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
for fiscally challenged communities in
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
order to have grants for on a per
 
00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.309 align:start position:0%
order to have grants for on a per
student

00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
basis the basic bill is intact can you
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
recall the the uh fiscal note cost of
 
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:56.030 align:start position:0%
recall the the uh fiscal note cost of
the

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.549 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
Lander so the underlying House Bill 1583
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
the estimates that we have are
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
approximately $ 61.5 million in fiscal
 
00:44:19.319 --> 00:44:20.349 align:start position:0%
approximately $ 61.5 million in fiscal
year

00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
25 $ 74.3 million in fiscal year
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
27 thank you very much further

seconded by
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
Edwards on the motion of ought to pass
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
1583 the amendment has been
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
withdrawn further
 
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
oh representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
chairman these are huge numbers um on a
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
non-budget year and so I'm I'm not going
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
you represent he thank you Mr chair um
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank the chair of
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
division too for uh withdrawing the um
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment but um this uh 1583 is a
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
result of the subcommittee on education
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
it was a bipar committee made up of
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
Education finance and Ways and Means and
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
this was in response um to the courts
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
and it was basically we all came to
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
agreement on this particular Bill and it
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
was um to show our commitment to the
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
state and to school funding so I would
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
encourage the the body to vote Yes on
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
this bill it's an excellent Bill we all
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
agreed on it and bipartisan basement ba
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
basis it's been a long fight on this
 
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
you m and represent representative Emer
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
do you want a motion describe why you're
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawing your
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh yes the amendment
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh was added at the time we were under
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
Court recommendation to increase
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh on conal and also the ran
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
decision which had excess swept staying
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
with return to the state instead of
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
staying in the
 
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
communities what this what the amendment
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
did was kind of do a wraparound on conal
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
and Rand in order to please the wishes
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
of the Court uh but subsequently there
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
have been stays on both of those
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
judgments so the amendment is not
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
necessary at this time thank
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
you further discussion represent hle and
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
then representative string thank you Mr
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
chair um given that education funding as
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
a whole is being looked at by our
 
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court given that although this
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
is a small portion and it directly
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
impacts our local towns because they
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
fund the difference especially in
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
Special Ed I do think we should figure
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
out and wait um on passing any Bill
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
relative to education funding until we
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
get to a point where we understand what
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy is by the Supreme
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
Court because that might impact our
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
decision and with a 60 plus million
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
dollar perear price tag we should um
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
probably hold on to this bill represent
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
Stringham and then represent Edwards
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
well F first of all I I I appreciate um
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
with conil and uh Rand hanging over us
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
that uh you had the courage to put
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
something forward it's very hard to put
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
forward a bill that would increase um uh
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
public education by 500 million a year I
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
do agree with you that uh um we don't
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
need it at this at this time and support
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
the decision to withdraw that even
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
though that's not what we're voting um
 
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh in particular I feel that way because
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh this bill has uh uh been thoroughly
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
vetted meets a critical need and we need
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
to move forward on on um
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
1583 uh but the issues that uh that you
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
brought up in your bill eventually have
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
to be addressed by the
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
legislature um you know parts of our
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
state have been suffering from uh
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
outright depression for 30 years and and
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
the uh education funding formula is a
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
big part of that uh so uh to the extent
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
that conil and ran to become law that
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
forces us to to address those issues uh
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
but it's still good Economic Policy as
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
well as education policy uh to keep that
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
high in our thoughts uh that being said
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
1583 is not the place to do it so um I
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
will support 1583 as good law going
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
forward and thank you representative
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair I'm I'm
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
very happy that the uh the other
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment had been withdrawn I I don't
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
think I could ever support the
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
legislature giving up the power of the
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
purse and deferring to a Judicial decree
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
on the amount of money being spent I
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the that is the key
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing we're here for is to determine the
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
spending of the people we represent so
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm glad that's behind us and uh
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll be voting for the uh
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill thank you it's also I
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
think worthy to note that in
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
2023 the legislature sent aund
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
million uh break back to the to the
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities 100 million reduction and
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
swept hoping to see reduction in
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
people's property taxes did anybody see
 
00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:02.030 align:start position:0%
people's property taxes did anybody see
a

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
reduction so the idea to send a lot of
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
money back to the towns to reduce the
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
taxes does not seem to be a successful
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
idea they will use it
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%

to think about the costs that are
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
associated and the high cost so this
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
what my Amendment does it increases the
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
amount of the amendment to 35,000 and
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
increases each of the categories the um
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh Department was not able to um fund
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
each individual category at this time
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
but I would like to propose um the
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
$35,000 um for to go to districts for
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
special education thank you very much I
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
think that's 35 million I'm sorry 35
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
million thank you that makes more sense
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
a lot more sense Mr chairman just I can
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
I can put some values on this
 
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
yes what is what is the increase over
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
um the vote of the special subcommittee
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%

absolutely you know consistent with what
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
the uh what the Committees what the
 
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:54.680 align:start position:0%

students in every District all across
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
the state so it would uh would benefit
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
um uh benefit taxpayers uh throughout
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
the granite state and I hope the uh the
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
committee would uh would support this um
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment thank
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
you represent hacken Phillips thank you
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just wanted to add the
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
technical note that this am mment does
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
honor the same
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
um correction in the previous amendment
 
00:59:34.109 --> 00:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
that was offered and that um when the
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
special education numbers are taken in
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
October every year there are additional
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
students who fall into the category but
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
are not accounted for at the time of the
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
count that are you know attending school
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
later in the year and those costs do
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
accumulate to the school districts this
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill ALS or this amendment also accounts
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
for those additional students and that's
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
where the additional need is really seen
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
is that you know there are cases when
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
special ed students move into districts
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
after the admr is taken in
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
October and so it's really critical to
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know to make sure that we're
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
actually addressing the need as it is in
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
reality instead of you know the Frozen
 
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
moment of time that is taken in October
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
so I would urge the committee to support
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
those districts in supporting those
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
students thank
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
you that that's on my Amendment as
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.990 align:start position:0%
you that that's on my Amendment as
well

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
representa hle thank you Mr chair um
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
question this is 17 million versus 35
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
million per year correct
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
correct um and I think my next question
 
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
is for the LBA if I can I think we
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
increased um total spending from the
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
state significantly in hb1 and hb2 last
 
01:00:52.029 --> 01:00:52.039 align:start position:0%
year can one of you give an estimate to
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
the nearest I don't know $20 million how
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
much we increased spending last year for
 
01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.710 align:start position:0%
much we increased spending last year for
education

01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
ballpark I'd have to look back I can
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
remember budget estimates but those
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
aren't what the actuals ended up being
 
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
for 24 and the new 25 estimates so I can
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
get those to you I just don't have those
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
off hand here okay is the 620 followup
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
follow is the 626 23 Amendment sorry um
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
summary that's on the LBA website the
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
current one was that the mo most recent
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
for Education cost or sorry increases in
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
spending cuz I'm seeing a 600 million
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
right total calculated education grant
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if that was the
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
final number I don't know which document
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
you're referring to specifically I can
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
okay so to get to what you're all right
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
we'll give you a moment to try to find
 
01:01:55.359 --> 01:02:24.829 align:start position:0%
we'll give you a moment to try to find
that

01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.789 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
McGuire yes thank you Mr chairman the
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
numbers we've just been quoted can't
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
possibly be correct so um we've heard
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
that the heath Amendment cost 35 million
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
a year and the Emer Amendment costs
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
$175 million a year 17 A5 is half of
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
35 but none of the numbers the dollar
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
amounts in these bills is half in the
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
Emer Amendment of the of the numbers in
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
the heath Amendment so if the heath
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is actually 35 million the
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
Emer Amendment must be closer to 25 or
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
some number like that or if the Emer
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is actually 17 A5 than the
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
heath Amendment might be might be 25
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
million or something like that but but
 
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
these just don't add up yeah good catch
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
the the numbers in in one Amendment and
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
not half those in the other
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
soal so the grand total can't possibly
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
be half right so correct Mr chair if I
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
could just clarify the this is one
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
component of an education funding
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
formula with many components uh I will
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
say there's some netting going on here
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
in both examples with the hold harmless
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's in current law so with the heath
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that would take a big
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
out of the hold harmless so it's not
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a dollar for dooll okay
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
exercise as representative Maguire
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
suggested thank you all right um did you
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
ever find the totals yes we
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
added represent whole thank you um so it
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
looks like we went from um 962 million
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
to 1,000 sorry 1 b40 million and in 2024
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
and 1 bli 53 million so roughly 80
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
million in one year and 90 million in
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
another for a total of
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
170 we just added in the prior Bill
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
we've talked about 60 million above and
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
beyond what we did in the budget cycle
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
and we're now talking about potentially
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
another 35 I'm having trouble adding
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
another 100 million after we just did
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
that for each almost each year in the
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
last budget cycle this is a budget item
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
this is not necessarily something that
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
budget okay
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
represent Heath thank you Mr chair I
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
just would like to add that um in the
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
numbers for children with disabilities
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
the count includes the children that we
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
have in charter schools as well so the
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
costs while seemingly High cover great
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
expenses and we've seen the levels of
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities for children across the
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
state increase and the costs are high
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I think for our school districts
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
this is one of the benefits that we can
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
provide for them but again the charter
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
schools who have children that have
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities that cost is
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
covered by the local school district so
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
that's why I think it's important that
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
we look at the costs associated with for
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
our children with disabilities thank you
 
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much well we still
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
have the law that the school district
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
has to pay three and a half times the
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
average cost and if and then above that
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
it goes to 80% State and above 10 times
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
the average cost the state pays at all
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
so it it isn't as if there isn't already
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
some help in the formulas we have on
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
education assistance so even though
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
we've gone up in these amounts there
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
still is a great deal of money paid by
 
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
the state on all special ed costs and I
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
think that should be pointed out thank
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%

drafted under representative Maguire's
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
between the two the one we had earlier
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
was the magistrate number originally you
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
called recall Mr chairman we had five
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
magistrates coming out of the division
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment brings that number up to
 
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.950 align:start position:0%
this amendment brings that number up to

Sweeny and I believe there is discussion
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative Maguire
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire thank you Mr
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and Mr chairman uh could we
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
hand out this I I this is a complicated
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
bill because it's it's from three or
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
four depending on how you count
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
different bills that we received we've
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
combined them all into a single bill to
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
make it easier to read and um easier to
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
understand and we don't yet have a
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for it so I did a little you
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
know handout here that that will explain
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
the the the numbers involved
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I mean these are not division 2 scale
 
01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.430 align:start position:0%
um I mean these are not division 2 scale
of

01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
numbers these are our little tiny
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
division one size numbers but
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
anyway all right so I'll wait till
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for pointing out the
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
differences yes
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
so so what this bill does the the all of
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
these bills are about bail and and also
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
including um training of Judges so
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
um the uh criminal justice committee
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
mostly has and I though I guess some
 
01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
came from the Judiciary Committee but
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
anyways they they've proposed a fair
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
number of changes to the way baale is um
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
is determined and um who
 
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
what happens to people when they're out
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
on bail and so on so I'll just go down
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
the list of the money these are all the
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
money items number one is they're
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
proposing hiring a new category of
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary employee called a magistrate
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
there aren't any magistrates right now
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
you can think of a magistrate as a kind
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
of a junior judge it can do a magistrate
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
can do some things that a judge can do
 
01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
but not not everything can't conduct
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
trials but can um
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh decide on bail can put out search
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
warrants and and some other things that
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
that are in the bill um the cost of the
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
magistrate is is assumed to be
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
$156,000 annually each the the the main
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
bone of contention between the majority
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
and the minority on this bill is the
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
number of magistrates the original bills
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
called for 15 magistrates which would
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
have been an annual cost of 2.3 million
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh um the amendment I I um in front of
 
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
us the amendment in front of us right
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
now is the 1.6 million annual cost and
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
what I would prefer is the um
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
$800,000 annual cost all right uh we
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
I'll get back to that in a moment so um
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
then we have the bail information system
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
currently there's no way when when
 
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
police officer arrests someone for them
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
to know what whether or not this person
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
is already out on bail on some other
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
charge and so uh this is a one-time 1.7
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
million to upgrade the computer systems
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
of both the Judiciary and the department
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
of safety and there will be some some
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
annual maintenance fees probably in the
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
100,000 200,000 sort of range um we
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
don't know what that is but it's mostly
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
this one-time fee then there's bail
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners So
 
01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
currently um bail is
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
determined um primarily by bail
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who are semi volunteers
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
there's 95 of them around the state they
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
receive for their work uh they they go
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
out when someone is arrested and they
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
want to talk to a bail commissioner they
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
go out in the middle of the night on
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
weekends whenever to the police station
 
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
where the person is being held they
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
speak with the with the accused they
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
determine if there's going to be bail
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
and what the conditions might be and
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
they are paid a $40 fee by the
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
accused um this these amendments
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
increase that $40 fee to
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
$60 and it also in the case where the
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
accused is Indigent it doesn't pay the
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
$40 or the
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
$60 um that would be paid for by the
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
state um and
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
so they would be guaranteed to get the
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
money when right now many of them um
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
don't get paid on all cases and so we we
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
I would estimate and this is really just
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
a guess that there might be 4,000 annual
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
Indigent cases so times $60 that's uh an
 
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.990 align:start position:0%
Indigent cases so times $60 that's uh an
extra

01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
extra
 
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.510 align:start position:0%
extra
$240,000

01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
$240,000
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
annually all right um the we had a bill
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
one5 which had the Judiciary hire a
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
training coordinator and it required uh
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
judges to take certain amounts of annual
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
training and other Judiciary employees
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
so that that bill has been included in
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.110 align:start position:0%
House Bill
318

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
318
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
and um so so the and that training
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
coordinator is given is charged with
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
doing training for the bail
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioners setting up a training
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
program for the bail Comm Commissioners
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
um and the magistrates and so that's an
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
annual cost of maybe 100,000 maybe a
 
01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
little bit more for that
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
person um the the bills uh require that
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
people out on bail for serious crimes so
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
for for for a list certain crimes that
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
are that are very serious violent crimes
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
and so on that if they're out on bail
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
they must be monitored with ankle
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
bracelets um the original bills had the
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
courts doing that but that was turned
 
01:19:33.629 --> 01:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
out to be unfeasible this the the courts
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
do not do pre-trial monitoring or they
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a pre-trial division some
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
states do that but in not in New
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in New Hampshire all the
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
pre-trial uh monitoring and and um
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
supervision is done by counties so this
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
these amendments move the responsibility
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
for ankle bracelets to counties and
 
01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
allow them to charge the accused which
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
is what they do some County four
 
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:04.639 align:start position:0%
counties already do this six counties
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't but they they all charge the
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
accused who's out on bail the cost of
 
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
the ankle bracelets and so we've
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
continued that so it appears to us like
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
there is no cost to it because it's
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
being paid by the accused and then
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's other aspects of these
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
bills that will cost money or save money
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
um so first of all
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
um the the cases where people will not
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
be allowed to be
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
bailed seems like it would go up a bit
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
because of this these this legislation
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
so therefore if more people are in jail
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
jail is more expensive than bail so
 
01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
there might be more costs involved there
 
01:20:54.199 --> 01:20:55.590 align:start position:0%
there might be more costs involved there
um

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh but then on the other hand maybe some
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
can who are currently in jail will be
 
01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
let out with ankle bracelets ankle
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
bracelets cost less even if the person
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
is Indigent than putting somebody in
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
jail so there might be fewer people that
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
way and then there's the aspect that
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
magistrates will relieve some of the
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
work done by judges and so therefore
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
maybe cases would be processed faster
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and if the somebody's case somebody
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
is in jail waiting on their case being
 
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
processed there might be less cost
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
although you know if they if the case
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
gets processed quicker and if the person
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
ends up not going to prison right but on
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
the other hand almost everybody who's
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
accused is found guilty later on in the
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
process so I'm not sure how big this
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
number will be but there's something
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay let's go back to magistrates so the
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
way these bills came to us um was that
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
that they changed certain serious crimes
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
those serious violent crimes can no
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
longer be um can no longer be bail
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
decisions can no longer be made by baale
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners for those for those
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
classes of crimes we're talking about
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
rape or serious domestic IC violence or
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
obviously murder nobody gets bailed for
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
anyways but but for those serious crimes
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
only magistrates will be able to or
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
judges can make those decisions and so
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
the the original
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
bills sort of theorized that that 15
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
magistrates could sort of blanket the
 
01:22:49.149 --> 01:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
state and make those
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
decisions sort of on weekends and so on
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
one other thing these bills do by the
 
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
way is currently if somebody's arrested
 
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
on a weekend and they don't see a bail
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner they can sit in jail for a
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
few days because until a judge until
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's a weekday and then they see a judge
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
who makes the bail decision but but
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
these bills require that bail decisions
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
be made within 24 hours um so therefore
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
that's why they want to hire magistrates
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
to make make those decisions on weekends
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
ja Commissioners work all the time 24
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
hours so anyways um but the numbers in
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
my mind don't
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
justify um the higher numbers of
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
magistrates the numbers of cases
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
that um magistrates are required to
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
decide based on these bills is about
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
1,400 cases a year so that means it's
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
roughly 30 cases a week so if you have
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
five magistrates they're only doing
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
roughly six cases a week all right and
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
and each so that's like one day's worth
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
of work right and the other four days
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
worth of work can still be used to
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
improve the situation with judges and so
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
on so in my mind only five are
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
Justified um some people some of us
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
think maybe we should simply make bail
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners better and not have any
 
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
magistrates others want higher numbers
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
so the other the other compromise is 10
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
so that's where we stand and I'm happy
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
to answer questions thank you questions
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire being none so I have that
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%

you all right we finished with division
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
one bills we next going to recognize
 
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for the division
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
three bills on the second
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
page uh thank you Mr chair we've got uh
 
01:27:51.149 --> 01:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
four bills here today um first one up is
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:27:56.669 --> 01:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
1363 I would look to uh representative
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
Mooney to make a
 
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair Mr chair I
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
would move itl on House Bill
 
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.070 align:start position:0%
would move itl on House Bill
1363

01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
1363
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
itl I'd like to speak a little to that
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I recognize this um this the
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
underlying bill would allow members of
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
the general court and their family to
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
receive um an employee benefit labeled
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
the employee assistance program uh there
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
was no debate really in the division
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
three about the quality and the
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
importance of EAP programs for uh
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
employees for corporate corporations
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
invest in these programs because they
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense issue isn't about
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
the program um in in in my
 
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
instance uh I oppose
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
1363 primarily because it would go into
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
effect um in um the next term and I
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
think a lot of us would be asked to vote
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
for a bill that we can kind of forecast
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not will benefit personally
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
from it and then and then the other
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
bigger thing
 
01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
though you want to Second this oh didn't
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
I second I meant to Second it yes yes
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
sir um and then the the bigger issue is
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
um our compensation is laid out in um
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
the Constitution it's $100 a year this
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
would be a new benefit for which members
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
would not be expected to pay anything
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
themselves into the program this would
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
all come from a increase in the
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
speaker's budget uh and while there are
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
other examples like dental insurance and
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
health insurance General Court members
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
can pay for those uh are programs that
 
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
the U member pays for themselves um so
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
it it's it's it's different in that case
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
so for so for those reasons uh I would
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh ask people to support um
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's itl
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation representative tki thank
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
chairman I support uh House Bill
 
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
1363 um and I do have an amendment if
 
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
this uh motion is unsuccessful that will
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that um
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards just pointed out
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
um the EAP program provides confidential
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
assistance on issues that affect our
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
overall overall well-being by providing
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
referrals and support to such issues
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
like emotional health Financial concerns
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
family challenges Health Management
 
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
substance misuse gambling and more
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
providing access to the EAP would
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
encourage our overall well-being as
 
01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
legislators to better serve our
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
constituents and would be a valuable
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
tool for the speaker's office the Senate
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
President the leadership uh caucus
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
leadership as they often attempt to
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
assist legislators as they struggle with
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
challenges that affect our ability to do
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
our work um my Amendment if I would be
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
able to introduce it when we get to that
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
point addresses the concerns that were
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
just outlined um it clarifies who
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
qualifies it includes language that the
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislators are not considered employees
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
um that there should not be any
 
01:31:27.239 --> 01:31:28.430 align:start position:0%
um that there should not be any
unintended

01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
consequences and it actually pushes the
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
effective date out to
 
01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
2027 which is clear that we would not be
 
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
adding any kind of benefit as there are
 
01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
two elections between now and then and
 
01:31:43.109 --> 01:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
none of us really know what the
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
situation will be um in 2027 and who
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
returning um supporters of this bill
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
believe that it's simply an expansion of
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
our already existing wellness program
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
that the general court has um that
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
really is embodied in our state house
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
nurse um we already have access to such
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
things as health education and guidance
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
for our well-being um and I'd like to
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
point everyone's attention to the email
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
that came out from the speaker's office
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
the newsletter just this weekend which
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
announced health screening day scheduled
 
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
on April 30th um it's described the
 
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
event is described
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
like this during the event you will have
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have your blood
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
pressure checked assess your balance
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
learn Hands-On only CPR AED operation
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
and stop the bleed techniques in
 
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
addition you can receive stress
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
reduction tips obtain nutritional
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
counseling enjoy chair massages and
 
01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
information on yoga meditation and raike
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
we encourage you to take advantage of
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
this valuable opportunity to prioritize
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
your health and well-being
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill just is a direct
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
extension of health screening day as the
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
speaker has scheduled with our state
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
house nurse um by preventing sickness
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
and crisis and allowing us to do our
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
work I don't see this bill as
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
compensation in any such way for us as
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislators finally the fiscal note
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
while it was not revised for my
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment um it's my understanding this
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
bill would cost about $188,000 a year
 
01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
and the legislative branch has stated
 
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
that it can absorb this cost within the
 
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:32.990 align:start position:0%
that it can absorb this cost within the
existing

01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation therefore I um encourage
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
everyone to vote no on the itl so that
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
we can um look at my Amendment and
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
promote Wellness as a priority for all
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
of us to be able to serve our
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
constituents better thank
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
you representa Stringham is recognized
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair um you know I I
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
felt like the big concern about this is
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
you know the term employee and that the
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh those of us serving in the
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
legislatures are not employees and we're
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
not but the legislature is a Workforce
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
and the kind of programs that the
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
speaker has put forward uh for wellness
 
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
day and a program like this uh would
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
would all serve the state of New
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well at virtually no money I
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
urge my colleagues uh to turn down the
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
itl motion and listen to representative
 
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
to toki's uh Amendment uh and move
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
forward from there thank you represent
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr uh chairman uh I will
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
also be opposing the itl bill and
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
will'll be supporting the amendment that
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
will be offered up by the
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative um which is regarding the
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
term date of this bill um
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
I did see on a firsthand basis the value
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
of this program to my employees while I
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
was the executive director for the
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire Planning
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
Commission and I saw that the benefits
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
of this program clearly
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
outweighed the minimal cost that will be
 
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
provided that will be spent for its
 
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
costs and so I would urge you all to
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
reconsider and vote down the itl and
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment that will be
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
offered and support this uh Bill thank
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards this is
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
really just a clarification question for
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative tki is is is the
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that you're uh preparing to
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
introduce exactly the same as the one we
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
talked about in committee or are there
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
are some minor variations between the
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
committee version and this
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
version we had looked at two different
 
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
amendments um regarding this bill one
 
01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
was from you which pushed the date out
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
10 years um and then the other one was
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
um the one that I would propose which
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
addresses the three concerns that you
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
had so it's the same one thank you for
 
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
that further discussion representative
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman so I have
 
01:36:21.629 --> 01:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
a possibly relevant personal experience
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
because I buy the uh um the health and
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
the dental myself and um back in January
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
I got an email
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
saying if you sign up for this diet
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
program we'll send you a free scale and
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
Fitbit and uh at no cost to you right
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
and it's from this program from from
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
this health thing and so I did okay and
 
01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
so now here I am
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill all right for the program and and
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
so I called them up and I said you sent
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
me an email saying no cost to you and
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
and so they said okay we'll take care of
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
it and um so then a few weeks later I
 
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
got another bill where they say we cover
 
01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:23.950 align:start position:0%
like $30 and your part's $150
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:25.590 align:start position:0%
like $30 and your part's $150
[Laughter]

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm about to make a new phone call
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow maybe on on that but so we
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
don't seem to get all of these these
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
ancillary things and I don't know if
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
anybody could say whether this
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
particular program I I do know that
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
employees get like gym memberships and
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
other things so is that all included in
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
what what we're talking about here or or
 
01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:51.159 align:start position:0%
not I don't know represent tki may know
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman no not at all this
 
01:37:53.159 --> 01:37:54.189 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman no not at all this
is

01:37:54.189 --> 01:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:59.470 --> 01:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
very similar to um referrals say
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire you went um were
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
in some kind of Crisis let's say you
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
found out um you know
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
you were diagnosed with diabetes
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
unexpected you're struggling to put it
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
all together get the education materials
 
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
you need get the dietary nutrition
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
counseling you need you could go to the
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
EAP program and they would have a number
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
of referrals that could direct you to
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
the right resources to help you get
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
through that crisis moment in your life
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
as you're trying to absorb all that and
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
be able to then serve your constituents
 
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
not miss a day in session and show up
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
and have the necessary um materials that
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
you need it's not reimbursing any gym
 
01:38:49.589 --> 01:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
memberships it's not any free running
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
shoes it's not fitbits this is all
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
referrals representa
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
Edwards I I would agree with everything
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative tki just said but I would
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
also say that like any benefit program
 
01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
this is subject to modification in the
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
future and that modification would be
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
done by the people who control the state
 
01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
employee EAP program and the general
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
court would already be automatically
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
tied to it so so I I I still oppose uh
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.910 align:start position:0%
the amendment
further

01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
discussion the motion before us is
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on House Bill
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
1363 if there's no further discussion
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
the clerk will call the rooll on that
 
01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%

13 okay representative
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh 15 uh 88 uh relative to court
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over persons receiving
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
special education uh I there on the on
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
the sheet here there are four X's for
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment so I think we're getting a
 
01:41:32.639 --> 01:41:33.550 align:start position:0%
the amendment so I think we're getting a
fresh

01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
fresh
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh I I think is what we ended
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
up doing was uh we discussed a written
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
document that was an amendment during
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
division three uh we debated it a little
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
bit and we um agreed to allow the LBA to
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
work with OS to find T tune this um and
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
as I understand it this has come back
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
identical to what the division agreed to
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
uh it spends a sum of uh $3
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
million it is uh appropriate for us to
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh accept because um well I guess I
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
guess I should have a motion at this
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
point or we should have a motion to
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
before we continue to debate
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
it pres Edwards moves Amendment 1391
 
01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.149 align:start position:0%
it pres Edwards moves Amendment 1391
second

01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
Muller further discussion representative
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
Edwards so just to complete that thought
 
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh rep representative Mooney did
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
some additional uh homework into this on
 
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of the committee and uh I I think
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
the summary of what she came up with is
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
that uh the the law around the age of
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh has been set in other
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
laws that are already on the books and
 
01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
that when we considered postponing the
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
start of this uh Bill the effective date
 
01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill till later what we were told
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
in in testimony was it really didn't
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
matter because with the laws already in
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
place we were going to still be spending
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money so what this
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and this bill does is it is it
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
gets our actual uh
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh government aligned across all the
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
Departments using the same eligibility
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
date and it also puts the the
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation for it uh on top of the
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
table instead of um circumventing and
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
being backfilled so I I would uh I would
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
hope that U the U committee would
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.470 align:start position:0%
 
1391

01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
1588 a new one just got handed out it's
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's to House Bill 1588 and the
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
none is it acceptable for a show of
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
hands all in favor of adopting Amendment
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
I see 25 hands down any opposition
 
01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.589 align:start position:0%
I see 25 hands down any opposition
that's

01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
unanimous okay we have down here that uh
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%

old
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion before us now is
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%

motion okay okay and representative
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
tersi will write the report I think
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney made the original
 
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
motion all right I mean am I wrong
 
01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney will write the
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
report yeah I'll do
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
it you do oh all right there you go well
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
it is it is unlikely not to have a
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
debate so if you have if if one of you
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
has a a a pi that may be all that's
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
required and likely nothing
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay well no if if it goes down you know
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
quite often we've seen things with this
 
01:47:01.149 --> 01:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
sort of vote where the speaker just
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
moves ahead and just calls for the vote
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
Voice vote so I expect with as many
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
bills that will be on the calendar from
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
this committee that he'll be going
 
01:47:15.149 --> 01:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
through them as quickly as he can which
 
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
is I I say again if we can just do pis
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
on some of these uh what when you want
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
to have more than that please send me a
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
message that you want more than a pi so
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
we'll be ready for it on both sides okay
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
so representative priest for the
 
01:47:33.070 --> 01:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.430 align:start position:0%
committee report
okay

01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
PR and like I said if you have a good Pi
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
you may not get to use it but you you
 
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
might be called
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
on representative
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%

01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
didn't rehearse this I I suspect you're
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:42.390 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
it all right I'll wait till everybody
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
has an
 
01:48:51.719 --> 01:48:55.470 align:start position:0%
has an
amendment

01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
was

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
revised so representative walner
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
whichever Amendment version you care to
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
138h and um what this bill deals with is
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
that when children go into
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
custody with the Department of Health
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
and Human Services If the
 
01:49:43.229 --> 01:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
child has Social Security
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
Disability or they have a Social
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
Security um payment because a um a
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
parent has died
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
while they are in custody of the state
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
the state takes that um
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
payment and uses it um and well
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
basically puts it into the general fund
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
and uses it in um child welfare issues
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
um what this
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
does the department
 
01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
have it was it got complicated with the
 
01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.310 align:start position:0%
have it was it got complicated with the
Department

01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
around some of
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
the Social Security laws and the state
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
laws and so this is happening in many
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
many states across the country that um
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
we are not they are not um taking the
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
the payments from from the children
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
instead they're keeping them putting
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
them aside for the children's use um
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
after they get out of um foster care or
 
01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.270 align:start position:0%
after they get out of um foster care or
residential

01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
care what we decided to do was end up
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
with a consultant that the department
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
would be able to hire it would um cost
 
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
$150,000 to have the consultant on board
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
um the consultant would be responsible
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
for looking at uh what this what kind of
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
ramifications this would have on State
 
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
budget um the report would recommend U
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
budget proposals for the bium of
 
01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
27 uh
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
2027 and we would be looking for a
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
consultant who has knowledge in this
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
area especially in the area of Social
 
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
Benefits further discussion represent
 
01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.270 align:start position:0%
Benefits further discussion represent
hle

01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
hle
 
01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I believe Mr
 
01:51:58.109 --> 01:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
Ripple has another amendment as well
 
01:52:00.669 --> 01:52:00.679 align:start position:0%
like 1365
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
copies um to at
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
least put it on the floor for
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
discussion everything the represented
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
from conquered said is true it does the
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
same thing it just manages the
 
01:52:14.589 --> 01:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
accounting slightly different and my
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
biggest concern and we've talked about
 
01:52:19.709 --> 01:52:19.719 align:start position:0%
this um extensively during the
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee was depending on how we fund
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
this position I don't want it to become
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
the basis for the future budget in
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
future terms that extra
 
01:52:36.189 --> 01:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
$150,000 um the workload would continue
 
01:52:37.629 --> 01:52:37.639 align:start position:0%
through the end of the year for the
 
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
report would continue during the
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
discussions and dialogues of
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
implementing this during the budget
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
season but I don't want to just
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily grow the budget by
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
$150,000 so this another amendment funds
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
the position through an alternate means
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
by reducing the um general fund laps so
 
01:52:58.589 --> 01:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't actually increase the
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
spending and the difference between the
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
two is this one would actually allow for
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
up to $200,000 instead of the
 
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
150 but it doesn't mandate it be spent
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
on this allowing the department to
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
says F further discussion quick question
 
01:53:20.109 --> 01:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
did you want me to hand that Amendment
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
out no I think we have another am mment
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
before us so we'll vote on that before
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
second who seconded representative W
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:45.109 align:start position:0%
 
Mooney

01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay representor Maguire uh thank you Mr
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a question how much
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
Social Security money is is in dispute
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
here and and would this bill cause that
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
to go away or is it just just to make a
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
decision sort of representa that that's
 
01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
an excellent question and one of the
 
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
questions that we have been looking for
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
an answer to for a while and that's one
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the things that the consultant would
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
help the department U figure this out
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
and also the num we never were really
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
able to um pin down the actual number of
 
01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.310 align:start position:0%
able to um pin down the actual number of
children

01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
that the state is caring for who have
 
01:54:28.589 --> 01:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
social security disability either
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
because the child's disability these are
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
these are children who
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
are very seriously disabled it's not
 
01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
easy to get Social Security Disability
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
so these are children who are going to
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
have a lifetime of of very um heavy
 
01:54:51.069 --> 01:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
expenses so helping keep this money for
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
their use and to take care of their
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
special needs um rather than go into the
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
general fund is really the the intent of
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
the bill and what other states are doing
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
at anybody
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%

200,000 and and there was a consensus at
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
150 so she included that amount and and
 
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh we talked about it offline and this
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%

01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%

discussion let's vote on that by a show
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%

amendment thank you Mr chairman yeah I
 
01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%

Amendment 1316 H um and it really is was
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
intended to address not increas ing the
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
bium by the $150,000 per year I don't
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
want to see that one contract be lumped
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
into the Baseline costs as they plan to
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.239 --> 01:57:10.270 align:start position:0%
 
budget

01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hull is recognized to
 
01:57:14.350 --> 01:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
explain his
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you Mr chairman um all
 
01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment does is fund the same
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
position via different meth mechanism
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
and at a slightly different amount it
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
allows for up to $200,000 in line 17 and
 
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:31.639 align:start position:0%
18 to be used for funding this
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
contractual position and then for where
 
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
the money comes it reduces the required
 
01:57:39.790 --> 01:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
laps from the Department from 23.4
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
million down to 23.2 million in line
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
26 it doesn't require that they spend
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
the full
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
$200,000 um but because it is funded the
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
way it's funded they could find a
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
position for $40,000 and use the excess
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
money to for other other things within
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
the department and it doesn't increase
 
01:58:04.109 --> 01:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
our spending going into the following um
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
bium you have more text in your
 
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment than was in the previous one
 
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
can you explain the
 
01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.350 align:start position:0%
can you explain the
difference

01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
so this was the original request that we
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
Maguire I think I could probably explain
 
01:58:30.669 --> 01:58:30.679 align:start position:0%
I think House Bill one probably has a
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
back of the budget kind of
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
reduction lapse requirement for HHS so
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is editing that part so it's copied
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
that paragraph out of house build
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
right if I can section two has to deal
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
with how to appropriate the funding okay
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to line 17 through 20 um
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
this identifies at 17 through 20 are
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to allow them to have
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and then lines 24 through the
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
end have to do with how this is dealt
 
01:59:06.189 --> 01:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
with in terms of where right the budget
 
01:59:08.669 --> 01:59:08.679 align:start position:0%
this the chapter
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
law further
 
01:59:14.189 --> 01:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Emer thank you
 
01:59:14.199 --> 01:59:15.069 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Emer thank you
Mr

01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
chairman I I appreciate the creativity
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
of this uh Amendment because it's kind
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
of like it's very Innovative but that's
 
01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:25.310 align:start position:0%
of like it's very Innovative but that's
my

01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
concern that this is very Innovative and
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know if accounting is going to
 
01:59:32.430 --> 01:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
be all thrilled about it quite honestly
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
because what we're doing is we're we're
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
paying we're paying for this out of a
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
negative reduction of a lapse it's like
 
01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
my head spinning so I don't I'm not
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
going to support this just because I
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.990 --> 01:59:55.000 align:start position:0%

02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
to be second committee bills which
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
