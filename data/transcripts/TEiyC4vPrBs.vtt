and i'd like it if we can try to keep
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
all the conversation down around five
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
minute mark if we can if it goes a
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
little longer that's fine
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
but let's again be respectful everyone's
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
time and and
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%

um
so

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
our bodies belong to god this is
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
supported by scripture
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
it says in psalm 103 know that the lord
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
is god it is he who made us and we are
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
his we are his people the sheep of his
 
00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.430 align:start position:0%
his we are his people the sheep of his
pasture

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
pasture
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
ezekiel 18 4 behold all souls are mine
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
the soul of the father as well as the
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
soul of the son is mine and the soul of
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
the sin uh the soul who sins shall die
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
and then 1 corinthians 6 19-20
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
or do you not know that your body is the
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
temple of the holy spirit who is in you
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
whom you have from god and and you are
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
not your own for you were bought at a
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
price therefore glorify god in your body
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and in your spirit which are gods
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
and then one corinthians 3 16-17
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
explains the punishment for defiling
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
the body do you not know that you are
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
the temple of god and that the spirit of
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
god dwells in you if anyone defiles the
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
temple of god god will destroy him for
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
the temple of god is holy which temple
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
god thus commands us to guard our bodies
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
against defilement knowingly allowing
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
our bodies to be defiled brings complete
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
eternal destruction
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
leviticus 11 17 14 deuteronomy 14 acts
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
15 19 through 21 corinthians 10 18-22
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
define what defiles the temple body when
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
it is consumed or injected into the body
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
jeremiah 1 5 psalm 139 13-16 isaiah 44
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
24 to find the sanctity of human life
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
from conception
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
in exodus 21 22-25 among other verses
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
identify punishment for harming a child
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
in the womb
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
the covet 19 vaccine in particular
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
includes known substances that are
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful unclean or defiled
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
but we don't know all of the cova 19
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines proprietary ingredients we do
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
know that these vaccines include lipid
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
nanoparticles that can pass through the
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
blood-brain barrier
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
and polyethylene glycol unknown allergen
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
we also know that all available vaccines
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
were developed and or tested using
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
aborted fetal tissue
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
any vaccine that is designed developed
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
tested and or produced using aborted
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
fetal cell lines defiles the temple of
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
god and is biblically forbidden
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that goes for all vaccines not just
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
the cove at 19 vaccine
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
the johnson johnson vaccine advertises
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
use of aborted fetal tissues on its
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
website the pfizer bioentech and moderna
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines which use manmade mrna
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
technology inject synthetic like virus
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
objects that operate by deceiving our
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
god-given immune system
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
via synthetic lipid nanoparticles that
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
block the body's natural defenses
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
just in its mechanics this
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
technologically this technology
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
fundamentally rebels against god by
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
first deceiving and then hijacking god's
 
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.230 align:start position:0%
first deceiving and then hijacking god's
creation

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
creation
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
in favor of man's creation thereby
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
defiling god's creation through idolatry
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
and then we look at romans 13
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
which outlines government authority woe
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
to those who call evil good and good
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
evil comes to mind in isaiah 5 20. so
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
the passage in romans 13 says that
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
government is under god's minister to do
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
good which means that government's
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
authority is under god's authority only
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
when it does good
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
what if instead however the government
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
calls evil good and good evil what if it
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
becomes an avenger to execute wrath on
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
those who practice good instead of on
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
those who practice evil i think i've
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
established fully
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
that to do good means to obey the
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
commandments of god
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
and to protect the sanctity of our
 
00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:45.430 align:start position:0%
and to protect the sanctity of our
bodies

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
so thus not injecting our bodies with
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
something that defiles it amounts to
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
good and if the government is being used
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
to force people to violate that precept
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
the government is now rewarding evil and
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
punishing good
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
since our bodies belong to god and what
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
we put in them as directed by his law
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
government does not have the purview or

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
does not require a medical degree like
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
mine to understand only common sense and
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
an open mind
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
we all know that once per year the
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
influenza virus mutates necessitating a
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
new flu shot before each and every
 
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.390 align:start position:0%
new flu shot before each and every
winter

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
winter
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
the covet 19 virus has mutated
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
approximately 12 times in two years or
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
six times faster than the flu
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
yet we are still being urged to get the
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
same coveted shot that was based on the
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
original variant of the virus that began
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
circulating almost two years ago
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
of course it doesn't
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
remember when the vaccines first came
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
out and we were promised that once
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated you could take your mask off
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't be able to get the
 
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.870 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't be able to get the
virus

00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
virus
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
when the vaccinated be
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
began getting sick that promise was
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
retracted but replaced with a new one
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
that vaccination would prevent serious
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
illness and death
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
this too was proven to be a lie as in
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
the month of september in vermont
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
76 of all cova deaths were amongst the
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated nearly identical to
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
vermont's vaccination rate of 79
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
if vermont's data does not convince you
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
let's look at that from the united
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
kingdom again in the month of september
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
75 of all deaths there were amongst the
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
this does not come from some
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
anti-vaccination group but the uk's own
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
national health service
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
and finally let's look at waterford
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
ireland where 99 percent of citizens 18
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
and older are fully vaccinated yet their
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
covet case rate is three times that of
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
the entire country of ireland if the
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
vaccines do not protect against
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
contracting the virus and do not prevent
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
death from the virus
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
what good are they
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
and now there is an unjustified pressure
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate children
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
children are the one segment of the
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
population best equipped to handle this
 
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.870 align:start position:0%
population best equipped to handle this
illness

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
illness
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
they do not die from it like adults in
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
fact in new hampshire a state with
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
almost 1.4 million residents
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
there have been no
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
covet deaths amongst children
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
in the country of sweden where there was
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
no lockdown and schools were kept open
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
there have been no covet deaths amongst
 
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:30.789 align:start position:0%
there have been no covet deaths amongst
children

00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
in fact in all of the nordic countries
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
combined where there are almost 1.8
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
million school-aged children would you
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
like the hazard to guess as to how many
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
childhood cova deaths there have been
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
that's right zero
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
the risk of death from covet amongst
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
children calculated by the israelis is
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
one in two million
 
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:52.900 align:start position:0%
that's 0.00005
 
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.190 align:start position:0%

there is absolutely no scientific or

to contemplate mandating the nationwide

use of these faulty interventions is

just not supported by the science

furthermore mandates violate one of the

foundational blocks of the practice of

medicine that of advice and consent

we already have an exemption

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
dr strang i have one for you so don't go
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
no i don't get away sorry so we were
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
having a discussion the other day with
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
both the attorney general's office dhhs
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the medical society and the hospital
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
society new hampshire hospital
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
association around informed consent
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office was
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that informed consent must
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
be free and voluntary
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
and the idea around informed consent is
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
a doctor notifies the patient of of the
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes of of the pros and cons so to
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
speak of a given medical procedure and
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
then allows the patient to make that
 
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.350 align:start position:0%
then allows the patient to make that
decision

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
given given the mandate
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
does that pose a problem for doctors and
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
ethics if you have if you have people
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
coming in to get the vaccine
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
who are being
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
told by their employer
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
you get the vaccine or you get fired so
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
threatening their the ability to put a
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
roof over their head food on their table
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
for their children
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
and then that that employee goes to a
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
provider to get the vaccine and says i
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
gotta get this because i'm mandated by
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
my employer
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
is that would you consider that a free
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
and voluntary consent and would you
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
would is there an ethical problem with
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
the doctor giving a shot under those
 
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.870 align:start position:0%
the doctor giving a shot under those
circumstances

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
that is not free and voluntary consent
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
you are providing economic coercion
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
by an employer whether that's a medical
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
center like dartmouth or concord or
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
a a an entity like the u.s government
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
which is trying to originally mandate
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
companies that were
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
had employees of 100 or more and now
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to look at any company that
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
does business with with the federal
 
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.070 align:start position:0%
does business with with the federal
government

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
since i'm a physician and i would
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
potentially build medicare i'm there for
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
a contractor
 
00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:02.470 align:start position:0%
a contractor
so

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
am i going to be forced to get
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or vaccinate staff in an
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
office that i work at against our will
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's what the federal government is
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
attempting to do this is economic
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
coercion and
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it it violates
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
what i consider to be as i testified
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
earlier the foundational blocks of of
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
medicine which is advice and consent if
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
you can't convince a patient of the
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
benefit of an intervention of its own
 
00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:31.510 align:start position:0%
benefit of an intervention of its own
merits

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
merits
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
then you've lost that argument
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
and if you suddenly say i don't care
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
what your choice is we're going to
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
mandate you
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
how do you have any trust in the
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
doctor-patient relationship anymore
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
you've destroyed it thank you doctor
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%

there being them thank you again doctor
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%

we always have

in supporting the development policies

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
which is not new to us
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
wearing masks and hand washing i thank

wearing masks and hand washing i thank
you

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take questions
 
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.190 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take questions
yeah

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
does anybody on the committee have a
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
i'll ask one um so again we're nice to
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
have a medical provider in the of in
 
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.590 align:start position:0%
have a medical provider in the of in
room

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
answer some questions so again around
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
the idea of a mandate and and the
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
decision around mandates for any medical
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
intervention whether it be vaccination
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
or otherwise
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
the question i have is that ultimately
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
is it the patient's choice or should it
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of the patient it's the
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
patient's choice to get vaccinated but
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
as healthcare professionals we reside in
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
a high risk setting and
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
we are providing care
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
and by the patient bill of rights you
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
know we are providing that care and they
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
oftentimes don't know if we're
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or not they could be
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
unconscious or whatnot and we're really
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
looking towards decreasing the spread of
 
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.470 align:start position:0%
looking towards decreasing the spread of
all

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.070 align:start position:0%
all
diseases

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
so it is the patient's choice of course
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay i figured out the
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
microphone um thank you very much for
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony um i'm questioning the 90
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
of nurses that are vaccinated sure right
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
now we have lots of availability so if
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
the remaining 10 choose not to get
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and then leave the healthcare
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
workforce what impact will that have on
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
their nursing colleagues and patient
 
00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
their nursing colleagues and patient
care

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
sure that's always a concern right but
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
also the cost of delivering care in an
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
environment which we're not embracing
 
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.310 align:start position:0%
environment which we're not embracing
um

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.990 align:start position:0%
um
reduction

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
processes is a real concern
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that's happening is
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
slowly over time people have decided to
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated we are concerned about
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
workforce changes but we're we're there
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
for the patient we need to be there and
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
and be safe and not giving the patient
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease or our colleagues
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
so we need to work with those that do
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
not want to be vaccinated
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
there in the ets there are three i'm not
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
sure if you've read it but in the osha
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
there are three
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
components in which would would allow
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
for folks not to have the vaccination
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
and that was released last week
 
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.470 align:start position:0%
and that was released last week

steve from new hampshire hospital
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
association testified last week we
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
always want to work with our workforce
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
we always want to support people
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
that's what this is all about
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know at the new hampshire nurses
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
association it's a big deal we we want
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
to work and we want to understand what
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
those concerns are and we want to trust
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
the science and we want to question that
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
science you asked a lot of great
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
questions last week
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
regarding studies and evidence we want
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
you know a and b
 
00:31:24.559 --> 00:31:25.750 align:start position:0%
you know a and b
evidence

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
but we also need to know we're in a real
 
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.350 align:start position:0%
but we also need to know we're in a real
time

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.830 align:start position:0%
time
fast

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
fast
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
pace changing pandemic and i recently
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
ran a learning collaborative with my
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues for long-term care and we
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
could track seven patients in one
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
organization who actually passed because
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
someone came in with covid you know so
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
there's some real challenges we need to
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
think about a workforce being one but
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
really patience patients understanding
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
hey it's a safe place and that's not
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
infecting our colleagues and not driving
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
up health care costs which we're very
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
um i have a follow-up if i may follow up
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
does the covid vaccine prevent
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
transmission of covid
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
so it reduces transmission right
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
it greatly reduces
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
it greatly reduces transmission of the
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
virus right and it reduces
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
the morbidity or mortality associated
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
with it and studies have shown that and
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
that's why we've seen a reduction
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
it also is an rna virus which will
 
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.509 align:start position:0%
it also is an rna virus which will
mutate

00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
mutate
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that means that we
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
are really we're behind the eight ball
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
slightly in terms of getting folks
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated the more you let an rna virus
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
replicate the more mutations it will
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
have and it will optimize
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
to potentially make a more dangerous
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
variant so that's really a concern
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and then one last follow-up is
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
there any respect for natural immunity
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire nursing
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
association you know we haven't
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
discussed the natural immunity piece i
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a really good question and
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
a really um you know i think you look
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
similar to my age we had chickenpox
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
right and so i think that's a really
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
good question and we need to continue to
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
work on that and have these discussions
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
so we thank you
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
good jeff
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh we
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
addressed the issue of the vaccine
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
mandate uh having an impact on the
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
nursing workforce yes
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
do you have any data
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
about the impact of not having
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
on the workforce in other words we think
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
of it as
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
having the vaccine mandated
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
decreases the workforce
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
equally do you have any data
 
00:33:50.559 --> 00:33:51.590 align:start position:0%
equally do you have any data
about

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
not having the vaccine
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
losing workforce
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
yeah sure if you don't have um if you're
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
not vaccinating say we were to have an
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
outbreak here in concord or at one of
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
the um you know we have 26 hospitals
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
or hospital type settings right so if
 
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.349 align:start position:0%
or hospital type settings right so if
you

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
can think about having a majority of
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
people unvaccinated
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
then you could potentially pull down one
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
of those hospitals in an inability to
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
access care so
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
you know we had to prioritize during the
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
early stages of the pandemic who we
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
would see
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
and so that was a result of you know
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
being overwhelmed so in the seven people
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
that i um mentioned that passed that's
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
also a result and a long-term care
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
facility in in
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
the new england region that's also a
 
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.829 align:start position:0%
the new england region that's also a
um

00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
challenge right seven people passed
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
because they got covered because some
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
one brought it in and that was when
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
lockdown was a hundred percent and it
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
was a healthcare worker who brought it
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
in so
 
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.030 align:start position:0%
in so
um

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
anything else is that ng a question any
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
next up is harley merrill
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
harley

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
look at her side maybe she stepped
 
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
look at her side maybe she stepped
outside

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
outside
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
sorry i
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to you about the
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates that affected nurses
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
and health care workers in our state and
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
i was a critical care nurse for 30 years
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
prior to contracting a chronic illness
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
which took me out of the workforce and
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
robbed me of my career
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
we say in nursing once a nurse always a
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
nurse it is who you are
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
nurses give all they have they work 24
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
hours a day
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
they work short-handed they stay later
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
than their shift if needed they
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
sacrifice breaks for the sake of their
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
patients they advocate
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
fiercely for them when necessary nurses
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
go to work sick tired in snowstorms and
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
when the rest of the world is enjoying
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
their holidays
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
when the coven 19 virus broke nurses
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
were there doing their jobs
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
taking the risks on themselves and their
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
families because people were sick and
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
needed help
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
when the rest of america was tucked away
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
in their homes nurses were running into
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
the burning building
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
many times without proper protection
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals told nurses to wear their
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
single-use masks and gowns until they
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
fell apart
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
there were no cries for the safety of
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
but still they went to work and did what
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
they knew what was right
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
they were called heroes
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
now after much of the population has
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
gotten what they were told was a vaccine
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
to protect them from the virus
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
we forget that those that these heroes
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
are people with rights of their own
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
nurses who are not comfortable with this
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
supposed vaccine are being told to take
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
the jab or hit the road
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
this is a funny way to say thank you to
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
those who risk their own lives and the
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
lives of the ones they love
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable people can disagree about the
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
safety of this purported vaccine
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
are choosing not to take it
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
these are people that understand
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
medicine and the rigorous testing that
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines and medications go through to
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
get approval
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
these are people that understand that
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
these substances have limited testing
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
for a limited amount of time there is no
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
data on the long term effects
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
this science is experimental and has
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
been fast tracked to the public
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
one detail that no one wants to point
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
out is that the fda still has not
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
approved any of these substances
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
the big lie that pfizer
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
is approved is not true
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
it is the german company viantech's
 
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.829 align:start position:0%
it is the german company viantech's
product

00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:35.190 align:start position:0%

comernati

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
comernati
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
that was approved by the fda
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
carmenetti is not available in the
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
united states
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
pfizer was given an extension of the eua
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
not fda approval
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
this can be verified by looking on the
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
fda website
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
this makes pfizer the pfizer drug an
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
experimental substance there are no
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
approved and safe vaccines for covid19
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
under the nuremberg code it is illegal
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
to mandate an experimental substance to
 
00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:10.310 align:start position:0%
to mandate an experimental substance to
anyone

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
these mandates are illegal
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
there have been studies in italy that
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
show natural immunity to be more
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
effective and last longer than any of
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
these supposed vaccines
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
people who have had covid or were
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
exposed to it have already acquired
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
natural immunity
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
basic fundamentals of immunology have
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
been thrown out the window to ensure
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
every living thing on this planet gets
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
the jab
 
00:39:37.839 --> 00:39:39.510 align:start position:0%
the jab
why

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
who stands to benefit from this
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
why does the vaccinated person need to
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
be protected from the unvaccinated
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't even make sense
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
why are people who refuse the job being
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
forced to undergo frequent testing
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
with a faulty test that expressed
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
exposes them to a swab dipped in a
 
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.150 align:start position:0%
exposes them to a swab dipped in a
carcinogenic

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
it is well documented that covid
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated people are able to contract
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
and spread the virus yet unvaccinated
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
are being threatened with their
 
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
are being threatened with their
livelihoods

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
livelihoods
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
is now a pandemic of the unvaccinated
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
well how do we know that even before the
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
jab people had varying degrees of
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
symptoms and many were asymptomatic
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
the jab is reported to decrease the
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
severity of symptoms so it's very likely
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
there are people walking around with
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
covid not showing symptoms who got the
 
00:40:39.839 --> 00:40:41.430 align:start position:0%
covid not showing symptoms who got the
jab

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
jab
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
the constitution guarantees all people
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
the right to life liberty and the
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
pursuit of happiness
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
taking a person's job who will not
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
consent to an experimental injection is
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
a violation of the constitution
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
making it illegal
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
sovereignty over one's own body is of
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
the highest priority
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
the taking of a person's ability to
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
provide shelter and care for themselves
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
and their family is not only illegal but
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
immoral belong beyond belief
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government has no right to
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
circumvent the constitution by
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
pressuring private companies to mandate
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
their employees into taking
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
any medication much less an experimental
 
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.190 align:start position:0%
any medication much less an experimental
one

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
they are causing private companies to do
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
their dirty work because they know it's
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
illegal for them to mandate the people
 
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.750 align:start position:0%
illegal for them to mandate the people
directly

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
i understand that our governor doesn't
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to interfere with private business
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
or private companies
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
but where does that leave us
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
the people of this state
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
do we just sit back and let evil prevail
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
or do we fight back
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
you have been given the responsibility

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
number six
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
stop the efforts to compile a registry
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
of vaccinated and unvaccinated
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is a dangerous step in the privacy
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
of individuals and could be used as a
 
00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:22.230 align:start position:0%
of individuals and could be used as a
tool

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
tool
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
to search out the unvaccinated in the
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
future a person's medical information is
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
between them and their doctor the state
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
has no right to it
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
these are just some of the ideas i'm
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
sure others have more
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
this progression to
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
cannot go on we are dangerously close to
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
losing our constitutional republic with
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the way this issue is being addressed by
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
the biden administration
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
please help save the live free or die
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
state and our citizens
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
and i just have one quick response
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
to the previous speaker about the number
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
of rns that are vaccinated
 
00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.190 align:start position:0%
of rns that are vaccinated
well

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
yes 90 i don't i will accept the number
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
of ninety percent because because she
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
said so but
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
how many of those were coerced
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinations because nurses were told
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
take the job or lose your job
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
these are bread winners for their
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
families many of them
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
they nobody can make that decision how
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
immoral is it for someone to have to
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
make that choice between feeding their
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
children and clothing them and taking a
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
substance that you feel could be harmful
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that 90 percent would
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
have been reached without that coercion
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
and it was wrong
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%

state for two months
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
we moved here from massachusetts i
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
lovingly refer to it as massachusetts
 
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
lovingly refer to it as massachusetts
um

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
we came here
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
for you know the live free or diet
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
attitude we've been coming up here for
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
years for vacations and stuff and we
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
decided to move up here with
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
everything that was going on in
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts seeing the handwriting on
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
the wall as a parent and watching what
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
was going on in the high school down
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
there that my children were in
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
they have a 90 percent
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate for the high school in
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
marblehead massachusetts and they were
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
still keeping the mass on the kids in
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
the last that i heard
 
00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.750 align:start position:0%
the last that i heard
um

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
they are moving to remove the masks for
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccinated children and the ones who
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
are not vaccinated have to keep the mask
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
talk about segregation
 
00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:21.349 align:start position:0%
talk about segregation
so

00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
like i said i've been here a little over
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
a month and a half almost two months
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
i've been to every school committee
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.510 align:start position:0%
i've been to every school committee
meeting

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i am horrified at what i've been
 
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.470 align:start position:0%
and i am horrified at what i've been
seeing

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i saw something yesterday that i just
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to read
 
00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:36.230 align:start position:0%
wanted to read
briefly

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.910 align:start position:0%
briefly
and

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
no single person including the president
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the united states should ever be
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
given the power to make a medical
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
decision for potentially millions of
 
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.349 align:start position:0%
decision for potentially millions of
americans

00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
americans
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
freedom over one's physical person is
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
the most basic freedom of all and people
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
in a free society should be sovereign
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
over their own bodies when we give
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
government the power to make medical
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
decisions for us we in essence accept
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the state owns our bodies
 
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.309 align:start position:0%
that the state owns our bodies
over

00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
my cold dead body when it comes to my
 
00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
my cold dead body when it comes to my
children

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
that is all i have to say thank you very
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
much for this opportunity thank you
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you very
 
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.910 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you very
much

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
so again if anybody wants to speak in
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
the back of the room in the auntie room
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
are these pink cards this is what we're
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
doing our list from and and calling
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
people up by so if you want to um speak
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
and fill out the card and just drop it
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
off over here in the corner to
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative shaw who's all the way
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
hello thank you very much for taking my
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
and for holding this hearing
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
my name is louise spencer
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
i was one of the folks outside
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
with the group holding signs that
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines are patriotic
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
because i believe that they they really
 
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.589 align:start position:0%
because i believe that they they really
are

00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
they help to promote the general welfare
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
which is also part of our constitution
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think they make a statement
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
that we live in a community and we need
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
to care for one another
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
and vaccines are one way to do that and
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
to keep things safe for us all
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
what i would really like to see coming
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
out of this committee
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
is a strong
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
policy statement that the state of new
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire supports and endorses vaccines
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
ideally people get vaccines
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
because they recognize that they serve a
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
really important purpose not only for
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
their own health but for the public
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
health in general
 
00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.510 align:start position:0%
health in general
and

00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's up to our leaders to set a
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
better example than has been happening
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
so far
 
00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:07.349 align:start position:0%
so far
about

00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
what why we need to
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
encourage vaccines not only the covid
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine but we've seen throughout the
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
history of our country
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
how vaccines
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
have made a significant difference
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
in people's lives and in public health
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
that includes polio that includes
 
00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:26.150 align:start position:0%
that includes polio that includes
measles

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
measles
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
that includes whooping cough
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
in fact my own daughter had whooping
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
cough after receiving one of the shots
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
and fortunately for her her doctor said
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
that because she had had at least one
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
of the shots
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
at three months or six i guess she was
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
five months
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
um it prevented her from requiring
 
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.950 align:start position:0%
um it prevented her from requiring
hospitalization

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
hospitalization
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
so vaccines
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
um have played a critical role
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see our leaders
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
really step up and counter the
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
misinformation that enables so many of
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
the statements that we're seeing here
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
so i would just also like to point out
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
that covet itself the coven 19
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
virus is a novel virus
 
00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.829 align:start position:0%
virus is a novel virus
and

00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
people have we have no idea
 
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.510 align:start position:0%
people have we have no idea
what

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be in our bodies over
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
time and what damage it may do or when
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
it might re-assert itself
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
we see that happening with
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
the chickenpox virus which later in life
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
can re-emerge causing shingles this can
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
turn into a permanent
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
really painful situation my my husband
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
is a pain physician
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
and believe me it's one of the worst
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
pains that you can encounter is to have
 
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.829 align:start position:0%
pains that you can encounter is to have
chronic

00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
chronic
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
shingles so
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
as much as we there may be things that
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
we don't know about the vaccine or the
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
virus we are learning
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
it is a novel virus
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think that science has come down
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
firmly on the side of the safety and
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
efficacy of this vaccine thank you very
 
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.030 align:start position:0%
efficacy of this vaccine thank you very
much

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for luis
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative leon i have one thank you

very much for your testimony
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
do you have any high quality scientific
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
data to show that the other points of
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
view are misinformation
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
if you do i'd love to get those studies
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
sure i mean
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not a physician myself but i i
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
certainly have
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
read plenty of
 
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.190 align:start position:0%
read plenty of
the

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%

next up is jeff howell
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%

good morning and thank you for your time
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
this morning my name is jeff howell i am
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
from pelham new hampshire i've been a
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire resident for 35 of the
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
last 40 years a graduate of unh i'm also
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
an engineer with 35 years of experience
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
now i did have a prepared statement to
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
read but as it deals a lot with my own
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
personal situation i will attempt to
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
summarize i'm here today to talk against
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
employer enforced mandates
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the detrimental
 
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.109 align:start position:0%
and the detrimental
emotional

00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
and financial impact it has on the
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
workers of new hampshire
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
i along with tens of millions
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
of other american workers across the
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
country have been forced
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
into a corporate mandate which i must
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
either comply with taking a covet
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine or i will face unemployment
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
without possibility of unemployment
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
this is happening these uh companies are
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
employing i think very abusive and
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
brutal uh
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
methods in order to enforce compliance
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
of their employees uh and i think this
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
is this is wrong um many employers in in
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
accordance with title vii of the 1964
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
civil rights act are allowing for
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
religious and medical accommodations
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
based on their reasons however millions
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
of many people who apply for these
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions are being subjected
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
to uh very
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh invasive and
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
invasions of their privacy uh both of
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
their religious beliefs and their
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
medical histories they get asked such
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions as uh do you routinely
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
participate in activities as part of
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
your faith uh what other medications or
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
treatments do you uh pose as a
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
consequence of your faith and uh what do
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
you just how do you justify taking other
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
medications you that use fetal cell
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
lines in their manufacture while still
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
refusing covert vaccines for the same
 
00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:05.589 align:start position:0%
refusing covert vaccines for the same
reason

00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
um i believe that these products these
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
types of questions are very invasive of
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
people's personal
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh privacy and medical history rights i
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
find them very objectionable
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
companies are terminated employees after
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
asking after demanding they comply with
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
all of these these types of invasive
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
personal requests
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
i think this is this is this treatment
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
is very harassing it's very intimidating
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
it creates a very hostile work
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
environment for employees
 
00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:33.270 align:start position:0%
environment for employees
um

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i think employees feel powerless in
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
order to combat this this results in a
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
great deal of anxiety
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
of undue stress and effectively uh
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
lowers their their ability to work and
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
these of these mandates are being
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
applied to employees regardless of their
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
situation it doesn't matter what their
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
job role is how often they interact with
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
their customers their clients their
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
suppliers their co-workers
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's just blanket across the board take
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
the jab or lose your job i think this is
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
needless to say creates a very very uh
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
discomforting effect for most people who
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
are engaged in it
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
they don't they can no longer perform
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
their jobs and these are being applied
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not people may
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
have exemplary job records they may have
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
nothing else against them in their job
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
but they're going to lose their jobs
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
simply because of their religious or
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
even perhaps medical reasons for not
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
wanting to take a vaccine
 
00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:26.870 align:start position:0%
wanting to take a vaccine
so

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
i just happen to disagree with all this
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
i think this is wrong i think employees
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire should be protected
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
from this side of harassment and i hope
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
that all these proposed legislations are
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
putting forward new hampshire will have
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
the courage to stand up to those
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
employer mandates and now in the future
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
and protect new hampshire workers from
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
these hostile and memorializing policies
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you jeff will
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
you take questions if anybody has any
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative leon i have one thank
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
you so much for your testimony
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
i was hoping that you could send some of
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
the information the questions that are
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
being asked by employers about their
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
religious history to the committee so we
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
can understand exactly how detailed
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
these questions are
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
i will i will endeavor to do that
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
however i will tell you that when i was
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
interviewed by my employer
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
they would not provide me the questions
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
in writing even though i asked them for
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
it so this is another one of the
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
harassing tactics that employers are
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
using they're taking all the information
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
from you they're making you stand
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
flat-footed and on a phone call and
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
start answering questions without any
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
preparation or anything else again very
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh disquieting and it was a very
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable procedure for me when i
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
went through it and i'm sure that
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
millions of other
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire workers are facing the
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
same thing but i will i will put
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
together from what i can recall the
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked and send them
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
anything else anybody else
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
what's that jeff jeff i will just give
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
you info so again on last wednesday we
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
had the business industry in and we were
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
speaking to various associations retail
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
and otherwise
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
um and there was some concern around
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
religious medical exemptions and the
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.950 align:start position:0%
fact that
um

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know we're putting businesses in a
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
really big bind you know with this
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
mandate and and religious exemptions
 
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.470 align:start position:0%
mandate and and religious exemptions
they

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
they've been told you know
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
if you sorry
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
um we heard from the i think it was the
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
surgeon general who said that they
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
believe that religious exemptions are
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
being abused
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
and they should be looked into and then
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
we also heard from from um
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh businesses saying now it puts them in
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
a bind with they if they
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
do a religious exemption are they gonna
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
be subject to some sort of audit because
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
of it does it create a
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
civil rights
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
liability issue for them so i do agree
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
that there is some problems around the
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions and having
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
businesses trying to decide whether or
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
not you're religious enough to qualify
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
for a religious exemption and that's
 
00:57:50.799 --> 00:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
for a religious exemption and that's
problematic

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
and even the businesses from the meeting
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
last week recognize that that is a an
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
issue that we have to look at and
 
00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.150 align:start position:0%
issue that we have to look at and
address

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%

we were completely taken aback by coven
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.309 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
like everyone else didn't know what to
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
expect but i did not back down i
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
continued to work at my job despite the
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
fact that i could have taken on the role
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
of saying well i take care of my elderly
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%

illness home to them so i will not
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
put myself out there but i did not do
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
that i continued to work i continued to
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
work without proper ppe because it was
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
not available
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
everybody knows the stories that
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
happened back then i don't need to
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
reiterate them but i worked diligently i
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
worked very hard
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'm an excellent employee i have
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
excellent recommendations
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
in november of last year i got coveted i
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
was sick for three weeks i was not
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
hospitalized but i was very very ill i
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
ended up with some side effects some
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
cardiopulmonary side effects some
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
neuropathic side effects
 
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.069 align:start position:0%
neuropathic side effects
and

00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
when the option came out to get the
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine i made a decision not to get the
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine based on the side effects and i
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
will review that with you in a moment
 
00:59:58.319 --> 01:00:02.150 align:start position:0%
will review that with you in a moment
um

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
so i went back to work in december i
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
continued to work just as hard as i did
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
before i got sick
 
01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:09.270 align:start position:0%
before i got sick
um

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
i just i i'm really really struggling
 
01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:15.349 align:start position:0%
i just i i'm really really struggling
because

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
when the mandate came out
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
i applied for a religious exemption
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
i did everything just the right way i
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
was supposed to they told me that
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions were not
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
qualified under the biden administration
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
or medical exemptions which was not true
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't an accurate statement but i
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
researched it i did my
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
research i provided a letter of
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
and it was denied and i was terminated
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
on october 28th
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
now they were sadder than i was when i
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
left i was given flowers i was given a
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
card telling me how wonderful i was and
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
how sorry they were that they had to let
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
me go but that they were fearful of uh
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that they would not be able to
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
allow me to go out into the community
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that i have natural
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
immunity and nobody is talking about
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
that which makes no sense because that
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
is the gold standard of
 
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.510 align:start position:0%
is the gold standard of
of

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.710 align:start position:0%
of
infection

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
infection
 
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.829 align:start position:0%
infection
um

01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
but anyway so i i was terminated they
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
gave me
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh no severance pay there was no
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
anything like that i i do have uh 240
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
hours of earn time so i will be okay for
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
a little while but that can explain to
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
you how hard i worked for them that i
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
never took vacation time i have that
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
much time left
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to um and end a little
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
bit with just some really really
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
important details
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
so there has uh been many many studies
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
out there and you can look up studies
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
and you can find both sides right so
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's people saying no natural
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
immunity isn't valid and then there's
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
people saying yes it is and they're
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
saying no you the covid vaccine isn't
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
effective and then you see other people
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
other studies saying yes it is but i'm
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to provide you with some data that
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
i have found okay
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted to point out is
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
that there is no vaccine information
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
statement for covet 19 vaccine there is
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
a fact sheet available for each
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
different um
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine that is given
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
and on all of those they provide a
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
listing of possible side effects
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
including cardiac issues since i'm
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
already affected on a cardiopulmonary
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
basis i'm very short of breath whenever
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
i try to do any kind of exercise that
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to justify to myself
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
taking a vaccine that could cause me
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
more harm than good
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
so i just want to share these statistics
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
with you these were taken off the cdc
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
site from the vaccine adverse events
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
site this was pulled up last night
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to share some things
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
with you so the mmr vaccine in the year
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
2021 with serious side effects reported
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
there were 23
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
and with uh
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
total side effects there have been
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
reported and that's for the measles
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
mumps and rubella
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
for the influenza vaccine the
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
quadrivalent in 2021 there have been 105
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
serious events reported
 
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.670 align:start position:0%
serious events reported
um

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
and in total there's been 2 394 events
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
for the coven 19 vaccine in the year
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
2021 there have been 55
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
314 serious
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
events a total of 522
 
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:36.039 align:start position:0%
303 events with a total of 577
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
617 total events reported to say that
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
there is no risk to getting the vaccine
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
is not true
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
and to make people
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
have to decide on their own health care
 
01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.750 align:start position:0%
have to decide on their own health care
versus

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
taking this vaccine
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
is just not it's not
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
life liberty or the pursuit of happiness
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
goes against everything i
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
volunteered to go into the air force for
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i i respect
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
everybody's decision to make their own
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
right to the vaccine or not but when you
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
mandate it and you take away people's
 
01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.190 align:start position:0%
mandate it and you take away people's
jobs

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%

01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
kovid
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
i had it for two and a half days
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
i had the symptoms i know what the
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
symptoms were
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
it is not as dangerous as what we have
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
been led to believe we have been lied
 
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
been led to believe we have been lied
to

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.230 align:start position:0%
to
throughout

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
because now
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
everyone has to have a vaccine for
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
what they cracked it up to be
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
i have a natural immunity no one with
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
whom i have been associated has come
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
not one
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
i have nurse friends
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
they come to me for help because they
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to take this vaccine because
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
they know what it's doing
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
they're in the hospital seeing people
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
who have had vaccines
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
sick with it
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
most of the people who come in with
 
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.470 align:start position:0%
most of the people who come in with
these

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
with illnesses
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
have been vaccinated
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't protect you against
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
do you know what it's designed to do
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
it's designed to destroy your immune
 
01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:29.349 align:start position:0%
it's designed to destroy your immune
system

01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
what it does is it trains your natural
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
immunity to look only for the coveted
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
vacci the covid
 
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.789 align:start position:0%
vacci the covid
19

01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
19
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
it does not look for the variants it
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
trains your immune system to
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
ignore everything but that
 
01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:49.589 align:start position:0%
ignore everything but that
virus

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
virus
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
so if you get anything else you're going
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
this is not a conspiracy
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're here now
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
a conspiracy is only a conspiracy until
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
when these people are unemployed let go
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're suspended without pay do you
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
know what that means
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
i have no more words for this is so
 
01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:35.430 align:start position:0%
i have no more words for this is so
disgusting

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
disgusting
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's so corrupt
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
i have no words
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for patricia
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're all set thank you patricia
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
next up is jennifer smith dr jennifer
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
smith from the new hampshire public
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you for taking testimony from
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
us um
 
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.149 align:start position:0%
us um
i

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot to say but i'll try to keep
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
it really brief
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what to really call it
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
what what what seems to me to be
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
entirely misinformed opinion being
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
shouted can we just speak up a little
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
i am double masked which i don't usually
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
do but since i'm in a room full of
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
people who are not mad
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
for quite a bit bit of time um i i
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
made it
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
fully um and i
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
just want to point some things out
 
01:08:58.319 --> 01:08:59.430 align:start position:0%
just want to point some things out
that

01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
and and by the way the question about
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
getting statistics i'm sure that our
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
department of public health services
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
would be happy to supply you statistics
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
but looking at national statistics which
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
i do every morning
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
the the current
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
finding is that people who are
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated still have a risk no
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination is 100
 
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.749 align:start position:0%
vaccination is 100
protective

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
protective
 
01:09:25.759 --> 01:09:27.030 align:start position:0%
protective
and

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
so health care workers especially really
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
need to vaccinate
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
to protect others
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
and we've had mandates in health care
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
systems for vaccine for a long time
 
01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:39.269 align:start position:0%
systems for vaccine for a long time
and

01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
i i can remember in fact when i was a
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
intern and started serving on policy
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee for infectious infection
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
control at the hospital in connecticut
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
where i was trained
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we actually had to go through the
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
process of deciding about that for
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
rubiola that is in fact german measles
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
and you think about it for a while and
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
you go you know
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
all it takes is one health care worker
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
in contact with a pregnant woman to end
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
up with
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
the baby that i once saw
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
at another hospital in connecticut who
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
would never develop into anything
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
other than a small
 
01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.350 align:start position:0%
other than a small
sick

01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
child um
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
who would never be able to
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
do much of anything and so it's kind of
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
like mandates are necessary
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
in some situations and
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
there is already by the way a court case
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
being brought by the state of new
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and multiple other states so
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
this committee does not need to
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
recommended the legislature do anything
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that case will find its way to the u.s
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court eventually
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i think they will probably find i
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
hope with the same
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
rationale that happened over a hundred
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
years ago that the state can mandate
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines for people
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
and there is actually an alternative at
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
this point for people who don't want
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines and that is to get themselves
 
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.830 align:start position:0%
vaccines and that is to get themselves
tested

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
tested
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
regularly believe it's weekly i've
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
forgotten but
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
the evidence for
 
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.430 align:start position:0%
the evidence for
problems

01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
from this vaccine
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
compared to the evidence for problems
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
for getting coveted which is still
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
rampant in this state
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
is really thin
 
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.790 align:start position:0%
is really thin
and

01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
for instance the myocarditis
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
pericarditis that has occurred in some
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
mostly young men
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
has all recovered 100 percent have
 
01:11:38.159 --> 01:11:39.990 align:start position:0%
has all recovered 100 percent have
recovered

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
recovered
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
and that can't be said for even young
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
men who've had coded
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
very very tiny percentage of people with
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
poor immune competence for unknown
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
reasons who didn't know that have died
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
at young ages including children by the
 
01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.350 align:start position:0%
at young ages including children by the
way

01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.229 align:start position:0%
way
and

01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
right now this
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
epidemic of the unvaccinated yes it does
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
it affects some of us who are vaccinated
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
but it's about six times as likely that
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
the unvaccinated will get
 
01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.350 align:start position:0%
the unvaccinated will get
infected

01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
infected
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
and pass it on by the way
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
and 12 times it's likely that they will
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
die and there is so much misinformation
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
out there that some
 
01:12:21.679 --> 01:12:22.630 align:start position:0%
out there that some
people

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
who really would benefit from the
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination have decided not to get it
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
i would urge you not to do anything that
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
will interfere
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
with further public health efforts and
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
i just had one little historical thing
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
but aside from my own experience as a
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
child we were just so
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
happy to have polio vaccine
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
you know it probably would have been an
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization at the time
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
it had that been the way things worked
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
but it was not better study than this
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
it was a new novel technology
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
and if you go back all the way to the
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
birth of this country there are
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
good historians who think we wouldn't
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
have this country
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
if general washington hadn't gone
 
01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.669 align:start position:0%
if general washington hadn't gone
against

01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of people's
 
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.470 align:start position:0%
a lot of people's
fear

01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
fear
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
and mandated immunization of all the
 
01:13:20.159 --> 01:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
and mandated immunization of all the
troops

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
troops
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
in 1777
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
because smallpox was rampant
 
01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:28.310 align:start position:0%
because smallpox was rampant
and

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
bringing new recruits into his camp was
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge problem if people
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
weren't vaccinated so he did it against
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of public opinion
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
and it worked
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
so bear those kinds of things in mind
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh willing to take questions
 
01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.510 align:start position:0%
thank you uh willing to take questions

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
and we have a question with the doctor
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative leon um thank you so much
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
for your testimony in the historic
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
context uh do you know what the fatality
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
rate was for smallpox oh way higher than
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
this there's no question that this is a
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
much less lethal virus however people
 
01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.270 align:start position:0%
much less lethal virus however people
are

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's somewhere around 700 or 750
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
000 in this country alone
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
millions across the world
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
have died of this virus
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
so it isn't trivial do i know the exact
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
fatality rate that changes over time as
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
we've gotten better at treatment
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we now
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
soon we'll have a pill that actually is
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
effective we actually have one that's
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
been shown in one study luvox
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
antidepressant that's been shown to be
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
pretty damp defective
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
but all the other treatments
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
no they have not
 
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.229 align:start position:0%
no they have not
so

01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's a
 
01:14:45.679 --> 01:14:47.270 align:start position:0%
it's it's a
ongoing

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.790 align:start position:0%
ongoing
story

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
and by the way um the the
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
the idea that it is not protective
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
against variants is not true
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of people who have
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
been fully vaccinated
 
01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
been fully vaccinated
with

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
mrna vaccines
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
are protected against the current
 
01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:08.390 align:start position:0%
are protected against the current
variance

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
variance
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
justice almost as well as against the
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
original although it's hard to tell
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
again because you've got this
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
progression and
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
ability to do good medical care
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge of things like prone
 
01:15:20.159 --> 01:15:21.669 align:start position:0%
knowledge of things like prone
positioning

01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
positioning
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
being very life-saving
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
those things weren't known when we
 
01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:28.070 align:start position:0%
those things weren't known when we
started

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
well if i could follow up will
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
availability of that that new therapy
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
for covid that reduces the burden
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
disease burden make a difference for you
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of mandating the vaccine i have
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
no idea until it's out there
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's not out there yet so we'll see data
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
matters and if i may just have one more
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
um you speak to the polio vaccine do you
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
know if it was the jonas salk vaccine
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
that eliminated polio or if it was a
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
different eliminated polio from the
 
01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:55.669 align:start position:0%
different eliminated polio from the
world

01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
it comes back into this country
 
01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:58.870 align:start position:0%
it comes back into this country
periodically

01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
periodically
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
very sporadically thank god
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes it is in the soil it started with an
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
oral vaccine
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
it was extremely effective and it is
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually still the strategy of
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
preference there is a side effect
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
potential and again i've forgotten the
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
exact statistics that some immune
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
systems and some small children are
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
incompetent and they will get polio from
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
but overall
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
it has driven down the numbers of polio
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
cases remarkably
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
we in this country switched from oral to
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
injectable because it does not have that
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
risk but it is not as effective
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
in suppressing outbreaks and so in
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
places where there are still outbreaks
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
pakistan nigeria
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
places like that
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
they use the
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
oral and some places have
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
done a combined strategy
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
injectable and then oral later
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
and are you aware that those are not the
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
salk vaccine those are actually the
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
sabin vaccine that was developed because
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
there was letter ans asked the question
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
and you can answer the question that the
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
saben vaccine was developed with the
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
help of jonas salk using unvaccinated
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
populations and had the salk vaccine
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
been forced upon the whole world we
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
never would have seen the saben vaccine
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
or is that just a consequence of history
 
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:18.870 align:start position:0%
or is that just a consequence of history
that

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
answer and i don't know which is salt
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
and which is saving we just think of
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
oral and injectable when we talk about
 
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
oral and injectable when we talk about
them

01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
just as it comes to the lawsuits do you
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
do know that um as of friday there are
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
two lawsuits pending in front of the i
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
believe it's the fifth circuit
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
one of which is on the executive orders
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh the mandate for federal contractors
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
under executive orders and then there's
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
a second lawsuit that was filed
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
regarding the osha violation and new
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's joined both those lawsuits
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
opposing the mandates under both
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
executive order and osha mandates so if
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
you didn't know that that um our
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general has signed on to both
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
next up is amy ellis
 
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.870 align:start position:0%
next up is amy ellis
amy

01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
my name is amy ellis i am a wife and
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
mother of two boys and a proud citizen

of the livery or die state
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
my hope in prayer and speaking today is
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
that everyone will listen and take the
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
time to consider and understand
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
why we are opposed to the vaccine
 
01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
why we are opposed to the vaccine
mandates

01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
a point of view that has been largely
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
dismissed and discredited if not
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
completely censored
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
the mainstream media has cruelly tried
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
to put and keep us all in a perpetual
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
state of fear
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to covid19 and anyone opposed
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
to the vaccine while one opinion is
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
repeated over and over
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
the other is completely removed from the
 
01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.030 align:start position:0%
the other is completely removed from the
conversation

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
dr asset levy said doctors and
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
scientists who disagree with the safety
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
and effectiveness of this so-called
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine are met with hostility rejection
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
and even elimination from government
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%

this censorship

is a fact and should deeply concern

01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
they have very literally pledged to us
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
all their lives their fortunes and their
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
sacred honor they have everything to
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
lose and still speak out
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
i have learned enough about the possible
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
side effects of taking this vaccine to
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
know it is far too soon for my comfort
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
to take this injection
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
this should remain my choice
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
as with all drugs we are given a list of
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
side effects
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
as the consumers and we can choose to
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
avoid them if we feel this risk is too
 
01:19:59.040 --> 01:19:59.910 align:start position:0%
avoid them if we feel this risk is too
high

01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
for myself and certainly my children as
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
of now the risks far outweigh the reward
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
this choice does not
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
make me selfish
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
or uneducated contrary to the popular
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
narrative it also doesn't mean i love my
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
kids family friends and neighbors any
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
more or less than someone who chooses
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
this vaccine
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
to those who have chosen to take this
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine i am grateful you are able to be
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
given that peace of mind if it is as
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful as they say and i pray it is
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
then you need to rest assured in your
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
decision and trust its effectiveness
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
i pray you will all have the grace
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
patience and compassion to understand my
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
reservations and sincere concerns in
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
this vaccine and the consequences of
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
mandating any injection never mind in
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
brand new vaccine with an unusually high
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
rate of side effects
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
i will never judge another mother or
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
father's personal or private choice of
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not to get this vaccine we
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
are all doing what we feel is best based
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the information we have available
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
we all need to be critical thinkers dig
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
deep for all viewpoints especially those
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
that are being so desperately and
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
deliberately concealed and respect each
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
other's conclusions
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
mass right excuse me mass and rush
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
vaccinations have robbed us of the time
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to determine real adverse
 
01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.189 align:start position:0%
necessary to determine real adverse
reactions

01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
reactions
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
we are being manipulated to take a brand
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
new so-called vaccine and will have no
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
recourse whatsoever if we are injured by
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
it this is an outrage
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
whether time shows this vaccine is good
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
or not history will show that the
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
mandates are wrong
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
mandating this vaccine will absolutely
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
lead to a precedent we will only
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
understand once it is too late
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
we are all americans we cannot lose our
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
humility and empathy for each other
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
live free or die
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
and god bless america
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony is there
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
any are there any questions
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for this
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to allow all of us to speak
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
the current vaccine or back shot as i
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
would prefer to call it for use for
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
covid does not prevent you from getting
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
the disease
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
does not prevent you from spreading the
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
disease to others
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
and if you have an adverse reaction
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
there is no recourse
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
so the reason i am not calling it a
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine is the cdc changed their
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
definition of a vaccine
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
originally the vaccine was a product
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
that stimulates a person's immune system
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
to produce immunity
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
to a specific disease
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
protecting that person from the disease
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
in august 31st they changed their
 
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.510 align:start position:0%
in august 31st they changed their
vaccine

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
definition to a preparation that is used
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
to stimulate the body's immune system
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
that is ill
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
it does not protect you from that
 
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.229 align:start position:0%
it does not protect you from that
disease

01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
disease
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
and there have been many adverse
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
reactions and deaths
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the current bears report dated
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
october 29th
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the united states there have been
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
eighteen thousand over eighteen thousand
 
01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.790 align:start position:0%
eighteen thousand over eighteen thousand
deaths

01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
and over twenty eight thousand who have
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
now a permanent disability
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
thing i'd like to speak to is the
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
that is used to allow unapproved medical
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
products if there are no approved or
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
available alternatives
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
i have attached papers in my documents
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
from the national institute of health
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
regarding hydroxychloroquine and
 
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.910 align:start position:0%
regarding hydroxychloroquine and
ivermectin

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
ivermectin
 
01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.030 align:start position:0%
ivermectin
both

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
and then a decision from the nebraska
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general on their state being
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to use these off-label drugs to
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
treat covid
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
attorney general from nebraska have said
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
that there are alternatives to the
 
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.750 align:start position:0%
that there are alternatives to the
vaccine

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
why do we continue to have an emergency
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
youth authorization
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
the mandate is unethical for a variety
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
of reasons but
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
primarily because it tramples over the
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle of bodily autonomy
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
and individual agency when it becomes
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
comes to personal health
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes the vaccine may be safe for some
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
and one can make a reasonable case that
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated may be a good choice
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
for some but that's what it should be a
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
personal choice
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
the mandate is unconstitutional because
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
there is no basis in the constitution
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
which lets the executive branch
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
of power and authority to compel private
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
businesses to take these actions
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
the president
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
and the executive branch like the
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
department of labor are not legislative
 
01:25:21.679 --> 01:25:22.790 align:start position:0%
department of labor are not legislative
bodies

01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
they have no power to make law
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
their job is to faithfully execute the
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
laws duly acted enacted by our
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
our legislature
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
and then i just want to close with
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
the voluntary consent of the human is
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential this means that the
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
person involved
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
should have the legal capacity to give
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
consent should be able to exercise free
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
power of choice
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
without intervention of any element of
 
01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.990 align:start position:0%
without intervention of any element of
force

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
fraud deceit duress
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
overreaching or other ulterior form of
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
constraint and should have sufficient
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge and comprehension of the
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
subject to enable him to make an

mastro

01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
sorry i truly apologize amanda mastroni
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
with all the progress that our country
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
has made in regards to civil rights it's
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
disdainful that we would have u.s
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
citizens moving to different states due
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the abuses that its current state
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
inflicts upon them in regards to medical
 
01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.270 align:start position:0%
inflicts upon them in regards to medical
choice

01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's disdainful to think that my
 
01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.390 align:start position:0%
it's disdainful to think that my
children

01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to play sports or
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
engage in after school activities
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
because our religion refuses certain
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
medical treatments this is happening in
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
cambridge massachusetts
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's disdainful to think that my
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
children would not be allowed to attend
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
school because their religion prohibits
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
certain medical treatments this is
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
happening in connecticut
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
and california
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's horrifying to think that my
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
children would be seriously limited in
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
their choice of occupation solely
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
because they refuse to receive an
 
01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.669 align:start position:0%
because they refuse to receive an
injection

01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
injection
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
those who follow certain religions are
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
being treated as second-class citizens
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
their livelihoods are being taken away
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's also horrifying that people who
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
simply do not choose to trust the fda or
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
the cdc
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
in regards to what they put in or on
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
their bodies are being discriminated
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
against and segregated from others
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
personally i've had a mistrust in
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
western medicine
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years that is not to say
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
that there aren't some aspects of
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
western medicine
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
that have their benefits
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
however i have had personal experiences
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
multiple times where i was being plagued
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
with various symptoms and went to many
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
doctors to get answers
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
far too often their recommendations
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
either did nothing or made matters worse
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
more often than not my ailments were
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
healed by seeking alternative measures
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
namely eliminating certain drinks and
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
incorporating more fruit specials earth
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
herbs and supplements
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
none of which were recommended to me by
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
doctors who were covered by my so-called
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
so even if this vaccine were not against
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
my religion my family and i would still
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
be subject to the discrimination based
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
on our conscientious objection
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
my past experiences and my religion are
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
not the only reason i reject certain
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
medical interventions
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
many seem to be behaving as if the cdc
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
and the fda and the pharmaceutical
 
01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:02.709 align:start position:0%
and the fda and the pharmaceutical
companies

01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
have a perfect track record
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
i can assure you they don't
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
many products have been recalled from
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
the fda that had been approved
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
because they were injuring or killing
 
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.350 align:start position:0%
because they were injuring or killing
people

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
the fda does not deserve my trust
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
the cdc
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
advertised that pregnant women should
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
get the flu vaccine meanwhile there were
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
no safety studies for that vaccine in
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
pregnant women not one
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
so it is unethical for them to claim
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
such things
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
the cdc does not deserve my trust
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical companies cannot be
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical company said that
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
they would no longer make vaccines
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
anymore if they did not get such
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
protection from the government
 
01:29:52.719 --> 01:29:54.470 align:start position:0%
protection from the government
why

01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
because they were losing too much money
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the lawsuits with people who were
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
injured by the vaccines
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
so now taxpayer dollars pay big pharma
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
for the vaccines and taxpayer dollars
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
also pay those seeking compensation
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
for vaccine injuries
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but if i were
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine injured i would not look for
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
compensation because i know
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be coming from the
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
companies that created the product that
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure many of you have seen veers
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
bears you
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
also probably heard that it's not
 
01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.590 align:start position:0%
also probably heard that it's not
reliable

01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
well since it's the only reporting
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
system that health care workers are
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
bound by law to report vaccine injuries
 
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:40.709 align:start position:0%
bound by law to report vaccine injuries
to

01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
i will be choosing to believe every one
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
of those reports until proven otherwise
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
or until these agencies that are
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
supposedly adept enough to tell us which
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
medical treatments are safe
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
become smart enough to develop a
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
reliable reporting system
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
but even if only half of those injuries
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
were legit
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's far too many to be creating
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
then one must consider the harvard study
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
which you can find on the nih website
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
that talks about how only about one
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
percent of vaccine injuries actually get
 
01:31:15.199 --> 01:31:17.189 align:start position:0%
percent of vaccine injuries actually get
reported

01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
where there is risk there must be choice
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
furthermore there's this matter of
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
natural immunity
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
in many countries they are recognizing
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
natural immunity as a medical exemption
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
meaning if an individual has antibodies
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
they are not required to get vaccinated
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
there are over 100 studies that say
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
natural immunity is equal to or
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
protection that the vaccines are
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
currently providing
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
then there are those
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
when there are those that are fully
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated that are getting and
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
spreading covet any mandate is
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely useless
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
there are people with natural immunity
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
losing their jobs because they refuse
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
my husband a crane operator has been
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
denied certain jobs because he is not
 
01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.070 align:start position:0%
denied certain jobs because he is not
vaccinated

01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
meanwhile he is naturally immune which
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
means he offers more support for herd
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
immunity than vaccinated individuals
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
my husband isn't even given the
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to show that he is natural
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
naturally immune
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
it is very easy to test for antibodies
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
he is also given no opportunity to
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
submit a religious exemption
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
so not only is this madness against the
 
01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.229 align:start position:0%
so not only is this madness against the
constitution

01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
but the discrimination is completely and
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
utterly unwarranted
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
so i have developed a mistrust in anyone
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
penalize the unvaccinated
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
when those who make up the unvaccinated
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:52.390 align:start position:0%
when those who make up the unvaccinated
population

01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
have done their due diligence
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
following their conscious
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
following their religion or they are
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
naturally immune and therefore do not
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you very much amanda
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%

my name is mike burkett i'm from hudson
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
good morning ladies and
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
gentlemen uh i'd like to speak not only
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
on my behalf but also of my two sons
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
their wives and my five grandchildren
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
i am also the voice for many of my
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
construction co-workers tradesmen and
 
01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.390 align:start position:0%
construction co-workers tradesmen and
friends

01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
friends
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to thank you for this open
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
hearing so that we might be able to air
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
our concerns over the present situation
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
we all find ourselves to be in
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
what started out as a two-week mask
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
mandate has become 18 months
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
we are all living under a cloud of
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
oppression it would seem with no end in
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
sight and seemingly about to worsen
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
we have all had to alter our lives to
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
some degree
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
in order to push forward in an attempt
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
to get back to some sort of normality
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
i am one of many who was not willing to
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
accept the new norm as normal which is
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
why we have come here today
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
with that said you probably can figure
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
out where i stand in regards to the
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
outright federal overreach being forced
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
upon us
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
covet has been labeled as a pandemic a
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic is defined as a large epidemic
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
an epidemic is the rapid spread of a
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
disease to a large number of people in a
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
short amount of time
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
i believe that covid should be labeled
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
as an endemic and doc you can
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that if you'd like
 
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that if you'd like
but

01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
an epidemic is the rapid spread of a
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
disease to a large number of people in a
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
short amount of time i believe that
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
covid should be labeled as an endemic a
 
01:35:26.719 --> 01:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
covid should be labeled as an endemic a
disease

01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
disease
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
that continues to be present within a
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
geographical area but its impact is
 
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.629 align:start position:0%
geographical area but its impact is
manageable

01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
the draconian measures taken to combat
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
this virus
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
were not based totally on scientific
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
statistics that had a solid base
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
an example of this is the number of
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
deaths attributed to covert 19 without
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
co-morbidity factors
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
the mandate by definition can't be
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
authority granted by a cons constituency
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
to act as its representative the
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
constituents to the best of my knowledge
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
and understanding have not given any
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
authority to act on their behalf with a
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
38 percent approval raising rating as of
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
sunday night how can this ever be
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
set forth as a mandate
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
this is dictatorial socialist government
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
on display
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
federal government overreach is what we
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
are experiencing as a nation the tenth
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
amendment reads quote the powers not
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
delegated to the us
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
by the constitution nor prohibited by
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
the states
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
reserve to the states respectively or to
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
the people it was originally drafted to
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
quell fears at the federal government
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
through congress would grow beyond its
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
delegated powers and interfere with the
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
governing powers of the states and the
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
natural rights of the people
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
justice roberts in 2012 noted the tenth
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
amendment press on what might at first
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
seem a
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
counter-interactive insight
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
that freedom is enhanced by the creation
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
of two governments not one
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
and that was the national federation of
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
independent businesses versus sebelius
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
in 2012. the tenth amendment was
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
designed as a practical method for
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
protecting individual rights
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
my desire in speaking here this morning
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
is to show the attempt of the federal
 
01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.270 align:start position:0%
is to show the attempt of the federal
government

01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
to disregard my rights as an individual
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
the rights of businesses
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
and owners and to have control over
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
their own employees in regards to this

newly adopted osha regulation
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
we all know that the quote hundred

employee threshold is only the cracked
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
to have an inroad into all businesses
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
i want to give a few statistics
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
to give a clearer perspective of where
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
we are as a state
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%

i've taken the liberty to round off the

i've taken the liberty to round off the

then you go to one hundred or more

in this state the vaccination percentage

of adults from 25 to 64
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
is approximately 45.
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
this age group represents the majority

of the workforce in the state all

easy to see that the impact this will
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
have on your
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
i think it is safe to assume that anyone
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
who wanted to get vaccinated in this
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
state would have the opportunity to get
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
it by now
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
if this regulation is passed it will
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
have a large impact on the people of
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
this will affect me personally because i
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
work for a construction company with
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
more than 100 employees
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
i will not take the shot for reasons i
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
will explain shortly
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
and tradesmen
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
feel the same
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
some are here today it costs us a day's
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
pay to be here but we wanted our voices
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
to be heard the thought of losing my job
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
is very concerning but the principle
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
here is tyrannical my two sons also will
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
be affected in the same way one of them
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
whose wife is a physical therapist told
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
me that she has to be tested twice a
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
week because she has
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
refused the shot and she has a religious
 
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.910 align:start position:0%
refused the shot and she has a religious
exemption

01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
and so she's able to keep working
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
her sister had worked as an rna
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
at a skilled nursing facility in bedford
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
for a few years she just got her rn
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
certificate and two weeks later was
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
fired for refusing to get the shot
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
this was two months ago there are
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
hundreds of similar instances that can
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
be heard that have the same outcome
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
we should have the final say as to what
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
goes into our body not some bureaucrat
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
in washington as the pro-abortion crowd
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
likes to claim it's my body it's my
 
01:41:27.679 --> 01:41:28.950 align:start position:0%
likes to claim it's my body it's my
choice

01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
my reasons for being
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated are one the use
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
of aborted fetal tissue number two
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
insufficient testing number three
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
inability to factually support all of
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
its benefits number four natural
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
immunity five negative side effects six
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
obtain viral antibodies seven i am
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
healthy with no cold cold morbid
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
morbidity factors sorry i'm having
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
trouble with that one so my questions
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
are why should i get vaccinated if i
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
already had covet an israeli study
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
stated that the antibodies
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
built up after contracting the virus are
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
17 times better than getting the vaccine
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
why should i get vaccinated if i have
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
natural immunity
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
the studies are incomplete but there are
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
indications that certain blood types
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
give greater protection against the
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
virus than others
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
why should i want to trust the fda who
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
has recalled consumer products he all
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
know about roundup
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
and just last week two blood pressure
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
medicines were recalled because of
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
possible carcinogenic implications
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
why the recall because further more
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
extensive testing in a broader scope
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
this vaccine
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
was rushed through approved by the fda
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
but we will not know the long-term side
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
effects for this for many many years
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
what about herd immunity
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
the amish in lancaster council county
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania hit it head on
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
you can watch an interview
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
at full measure with cheryl atkinson
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
amish covent
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's a short video and it explains how
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
they handled this situation they hit it
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
head on
 
01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:39.990 align:start position:0%
head on
finally

01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
what about the side effects
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
if you've not heard about some of the
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
side effects of this shot you need to
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
take your
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
your head out of the sand
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
there are many incidences of people
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
having adverse short and long-term side
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
effects after getting the vaccination
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
one lady i talked to told me of four
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
female friends who have had their female
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
cycles altered after getting the shot
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
all four were nurses who were forced to
 
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are many who have developed blood
 
01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:14.950 align:start position:0%
there are many who have developed blood
clots

01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
clots
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
subsequently led to strokes and heart
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
attacks others have ongoing issues
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
negatively affecting them causing loss
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
of work time
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
at last count
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
there were around twenty thousand deaths
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
i watched a video saturday night
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
that i would like to bring to everyone's
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
attention and with this i will finish
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
the interview is with dr john campbell
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
and kyle mears it is 42 minutes long and
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
it is well worth the watch
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
meers it
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
mears is a professional mountain biker
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
he's 29 years old in peak perfect
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
physical condition on june 2nd he got
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
his second dose of pfizer vaccine two
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
weeks later
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
his resting heart rate was 25 higher
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
than normal
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
and and he knows this because he
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
monitors everything because he does
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
things worsened
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
and he ended up in the hospital with a
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
heart rate of 160 sustained at 135 for
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
two hours
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
after several trips back and forth to
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
the hospital numerous doctor's
 
01:45:41.229 --> 01:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
appointments he was diagnosed with
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
pericarditis and pots
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
he has been virtually housebound for
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
four months reactive arthritis continues
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
to plague him
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
he ended up hearing of other people's
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
reaction because of his
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
popularity in the mountain biking crowd
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
and found many people having similar
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
reactions he has started a support group
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
online called react 19 to help others in
 
01:46:04.639 --> 01:46:05.910 align:start position:0%
online called react 19 to help others in
need

01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
on january 4th i will be fired from my
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
job i've been there 32 years i don't
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
blame them for it
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
they are forced to do so because of the
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
unjustifiable fines they will have to
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
pay which by the way
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
is upwards of fourteen thousand dollars
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
what's worse they will lose at least 25
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
to 35 percent of their workforce
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
i would certainly be able to claim a
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
religious exemption but there are no
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
the vaccine does not prevent you from
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
getting the virus nor does it prevent
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
the recipient from spreading it so why
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
get it for me a healthy fit man i'll
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
take my chances but it should be a
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
choice that i make based on fact and
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
conviction not coercion and fear of
 
01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.189 align:start position:0%
conviction not coercion and fear of
retribution

01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
retribution
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
we have no motorcycle helmet law in this
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
state it's a choice for each rider a
 
01:47:10.639 --> 01:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
state it's a choice for each rider a
risk

01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
each one takes to bear it or not to wear
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
it or not which i think exemplifies our
 
01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.709 align:start position:0%
it or not which i think exemplifies our
model

01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
if these mandates and regulations are
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
upheld and enacted we will have to have
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
another one of these public hearings to
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
discuss a new motto for our state
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
because live free or die would be a
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
false statement a lie
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%

um i live in nashua and i want to say
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
everybody who's testified today has made
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary great points here
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
you know we live in a state that the
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
model is live free or die
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
i came to this state over 40 years ago
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
and you can still hear my new york
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
accent and i thank god every day i'm not
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
with bill de blasio down in new york
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
i also sat and represented paul from
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
2005 to 2006
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
and these are our forefathers that gave
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
us our freedom
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
that wants to be taken away from us
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
because our president who's not my
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
president and i'm going to say this
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
because everybody said when president
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
trump was in there that he wasn't their
 
01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.470 align:start position:0%
trump was in there that he wasn't their
president

01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
he did not give us mandates like this
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
which is not a law
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
you cannot mandate people to take a
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine i can't because i have
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
autoimmune and i don't like to talk
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
about my health condition i have been
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
discriminated against at my job because
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
i cannot wear a mask i haven't worked
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
since august 16th and i've been fighting
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
with them i'm losing my job most likely
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
this week because i cannot wear a mask
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
because of health issues i go into panic
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
attacks now
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
is that right to do to us to people
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
we did not create this pandemic this
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
came from the wuhan labs with dr fatchi
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
who has taken out money and has caused
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
all this
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
and when you listen to one of the
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
speakers who said
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to be inside for two
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
weeks to flatten the curve
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
oh hey people what the hell is going on
 
01:49:43.679 --> 01:49:44.709 align:start position:0%
oh hey people what the hell is going on
here

01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
where's the curve there is no curve
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
anymore my husband lost his job
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
he had to get a new job
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
i thank the federal government for
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
giving us so much money that we the
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
people deserve because we work for all
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
this money so they just gave us a big
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
refund wasn't that nice of them
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
but when you think about the reality ask
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
all you
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee members who took money from
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
pfizer immersed
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
who took it because i know which senate
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
is dead
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
why don't we start exposing each and
 
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
every one of them right now
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
because you know what you can't sit on
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
this committee or vote
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
and vote honestly because you've been
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
bought and paid for we all know it man
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me let's stick to the policy not
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
to the policy not the people thank you
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
and when you first opened up the meeting
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
you had a list of all i was trying to
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
write everything down but i couldn't why
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
should children who have zero percent of
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
getting covert have to wear masks in
 
01:50:45.199 --> 01:50:46.310 align:start position:0%
getting covert have to wear masks in
school

01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
what are they doing to the psyche of
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
these children
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
these kids that had to be out of school
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
for a year year and a half
 
01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.990 align:start position:0%
for a year year and a half
mentally

01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
mentally
 
01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.669 align:start position:0%
mentally
suicide

01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
they forgot what their friends looked
 
01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:00.070 align:start position:0%
they forgot what their friends looked
like

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
matter of fact on election day in nashua
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
i was talking to an alderman we were six
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
feet apart all of a sudden he says to me
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
are you vaccinated
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
none of his business nobody needs to
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
know if it's true or false i said no
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
next thing i know he walked six feet
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
away but i was six feet away from him
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
anyway and he had a mask on so if these
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
masks work
 
01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:21.750 align:start position:0%
masks work
why

01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
do people have to be vaccinated if
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're vaccinated why do they have to
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
still wear mass because dr facchi said
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to do keep getting
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
jab keep getting jabbed keep getting
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
jabbed and we don't know what the
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
long-term effects are on these children
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's right they're coming for our kids
 
01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:39.750 align:start position:0%
that's right they're coming for our kids
now

01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
my kids i'm grateful they're all grown
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
but i got small grandchildren now i look
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
at these poor and innocent faces
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
that never know anything
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
about racism until we teach it to them
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
they love everybody
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
but what happens to them
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
they go out into the real world and then
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
we lose them
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then we poison their brains with
 
01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.229 align:start position:0%
and then we poison their brains with
everything

01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
and then we have the mask mandate and
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
then what are we going to do say the
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
kids can't come to school and they have
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
another immunization well let's talk
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
about immunizations what about the mmr
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
when the doctor said she with her double
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
mask she couldn't understand anything
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
she was talking about and you say
 
01:52:20.239 --> 01:52:21.189 align:start position:0%

kids we mask them up at school they
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%

by today's standards he'd probably be
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
super liberal i don't know but he talked
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
about the pertussis and the brain damage
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
and you saw these poor children in the
 
01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.430 align:start position:0%
and you saw these poor children in the
wheelchair

01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
wheelchair
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
and your heart broke because these were
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
innocent lives
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
and then we i heard that other doctor
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
what was her name dr smith i think it
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
was i got notes everywhere dr smith
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
and she talked about polio and she
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
talked about all the other vaccines
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
well you know if you get you know nurses
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
you get shingles you can use lemon balm
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
if you get sick i think i had covert in
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
march of 2020 i was deadly ill
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
i asked my doctor four or five times do
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
you want to test me and she said no you
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the symptoms what up let's
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
talk about the symptoms
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
the symptoms are like the flu
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
the same thing as a flu they didn't have
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
enough symptoms so they threw stomach
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
aches in there so if kids go to school
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
and they don't feel good they go home
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
and they have to be tested for covet and
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
they've got to be tested they've got to
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
be tested well
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
what happened when the flu went around
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
the schools we didn't disinfect and we
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
didn't master kids or the teachers and
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
we have more deaths
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
from the flu for kids and teachers
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
depending on which flu was what about
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
the normal virus
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
what happens with that
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
people come off the cruise ship that's
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
deathly ill and it goes rampant through
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes and it's very
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
disrespectful if anybody be texting when
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
people are talking
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
what happens with that we never messed
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
people up we never disinfected
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
and so you have to really take a look at
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
what has covert done to us
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
the reset on the economy
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's what it was all supposed to be
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
we've masked everybody we have employee
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
mandates employer mandates that people
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to lose their jobs
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
we have now the trucking industry
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
i was listening to
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
attorney um lee
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
dundas i don't know if anybody knows who
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
she is she's in california civil rights
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
that from today for four days they're
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
going to start shutting down the
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
trucking industry because of employee
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
mandates well guess what two weeks
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
before thanksgiving is here you better
 
01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
go stock up in your house now and hoard
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
the food
 
01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
and then what's coming up christmas
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
and who are gonna get hurt the poor kids
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
again it comes back to we the people
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
it comes back to these children that are
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
in schools and most schools do not have
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
any policy
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
for medical
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
or religious for these students not to
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
wear a mask and to not to have to take
 
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines and that's the next thing
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen it's about time
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
that our legislature stands up because
 
01:55:37.119 --> 01:55:37.830 align:start position:0%
that our legislature stands up because
we

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
for a year and a half had a life of hell
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
in this state when our governor
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
continuously had these executive orders
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
and in those executive orders 74 it
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
exempted a lot and people with
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities that did not have to wear
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
mass that were forced upon in the city
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
of nashua
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
even with more medical reasons you had
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
to bring a note although executive order
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
74 said you did not have executive order
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
said that teachers students and
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
administrators didn't have to wear masks
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
oh but they did
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
so where are we going here people
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
we elected you to represent us not to
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
represent the administration not to
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
represent the governor to represent all
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
of us in this audience and i know people
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
because i've been at so many rallies
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
you've been elected to protect us from
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
big pharma
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
but although many people i think
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in the senate has taken big
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
dollars from pfizer
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
and other companies so how can you vote
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
how can you vote to protect us even the
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
governor took ninety three thousand
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of fisa money
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
so how can he be there for us we the
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
people and you might say it's not part
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
of this but it really is
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
because when you take money from
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
lobbyists you are no longer representing
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
us we the people that we vote all of you
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
in you work for all of us and we
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to be standing here and
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
rallying time after time after time for
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
our rights our protection from the state
 
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
and federal government and even from the
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
local municipalities
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
we the people remember that it's we the
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
people you work for us
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
and it's about time you start working
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
for us because we've had enough enough
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
of this covert enough of the mass enough
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the mandates telling us that we have
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated in either to work to go
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
on a plane to go into a store it's gonna
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
happen to have the quality of life
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
because that's what's been taken away
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
from us our quality of life thank you
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%

01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:53.750 align:start position:0%
remind everybody about time and
conciseness

01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
conciseness
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
if you're bringing up new points or just
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh hit hit
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
points they've already been said
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
hi my name is eliza hale i live in
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
nashua new hampshire thank you
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak in this
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
public comment session
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm a resident of new hampshire and also
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
work in the health care system here in
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
our state both my husband and i are
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
directly impacted
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
by the current covid vaccine mandates
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
brought on by the federal government
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
the current state of events in this
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
country has blessed me with relearning
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
as an adult the constitution both the
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
u.s and new hampshire's constitution
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
our founding fathers built our country
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
and our state on the ground that each
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
man and woman has natural inherent
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
rights to life liberty and ultimately
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
seeking and obtaining happiness
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
we are protected in the constitution
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
from discrimination based on our race
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
creed color sex or national origin
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
so as far to my knowledge nowhere in the
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
constitution does it state that our
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
government has any rights to our body
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
in fact to my knowledge the constitution
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
does exactly the opposite stating we
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
have the right to live free from
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
government intrusion
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
in private or personal information
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
and this is a natural and inherent right
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
meaning they are
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
pre-ex pre-existing the government
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
these rights are meant to protect the
 
01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.550 align:start position:0%
these rights are meant to protect the
citizens

01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
but yet
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
we are all here
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
fighting for something we already have
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
i am not here
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
today because i know how to define a
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
medical intervention i really wish i did
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
i will continue to pray for each of you
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
i am here to stand up for my natural
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
inherent rights i am here to urge the
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to protect those rights the
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government has overstepped
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
its reach massively
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has the power
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
to protect us its citizens from these
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
mandates that will surely change the
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
landscape of this great state in many
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
negative ways i cannot speak to every
 
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
field of work
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
but i can to our health care system as i
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
has been in it for 18 years
 
02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
our workforce has been hit very hard
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
over the last 18 months
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
and if we are not protected from the
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
current mandates the federal government
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
is attempting to place on us our health
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
care in new hampshire will be hit even
 
02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.950 align:start position:0%
care in new hampshire will be hit even
harder

02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
harder
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
losing even more of its workforce what
 
02:00:53.679 --> 02:00:54.950 align:start position:0%
losing even more of its workforce what
then

02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
what will happen if you have an injury
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
or a loved one that is gravely ill
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
i honestly do not know how we will be
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
able to provide adequate and safe health
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
care to this state
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
if things continue moving in this
 
02:01:08.159 --> 02:01:09.430 align:start position:0%
if things continue moving in this
direction

02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%

as

a worker who
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
works in a very
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%

02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm very proud of him he works in a very
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
noble profession
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%

resignation
 
02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
only to allow him to
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
receive compensation for unused vacation
 
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:57.109 align:start position:0%

02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
he will do okay
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the end but
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
i'm worried about his own mental health
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
and this is a state
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
and probably across the nation as well
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
where mental health
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
is considered a
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
problem for states
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
countries counties everywhere
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
and now there will be one less mental
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
health counselor available for
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
people who are truly in need
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
he started to say goodbye to his
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
long-term clients
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
of 10 years
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
he's had to make the announcement to his
 
02:03:38.239 --> 02:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
he's had to make the announcement to his
associates

02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
associates
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
people have talked earlier about how
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
businesses will suffer
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i can't speak to that but i know by
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
organizations will be
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
losing a very good worker
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm sad for that
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to the businesses of
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that are undergoing these
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
mandates but others have
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to see probably
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
deterioration in the workforce
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
i just like to address some of the
 
02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:30.550 align:start position:0%
i just like to address some of the
personal

02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
personal
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
effects of
 
02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.910 align:start position:0%
effects of
mandates

02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
mandates have allowed people to shame
 
02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
the unvaccinated
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
former friends of ours i won't say
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
former i will say
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
friends who are
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
maybe less friendly now
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
have actually said
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
in a group
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
we should find out who's unvaccinated
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
and shame them
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
no amount of shaming is going to
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
make people
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
take a vaccination that they have every
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
right to refuse
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
we will never reach
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
herd immunity through vaccination except
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
that fact
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
it will not happen
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
we all know when we go into different
 
02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:28.870 align:start position:0%
we all know when we go into different
stores

02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
stores
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
we see the signs
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
you must wear a mask if you're
 
02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:36.310 align:start position:0%
you must wear a mask if you're
unvaccinated

02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
i wear a mask if i'm unvaccinated or not
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
i'm worried about the vaccinated people
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
i've got a mask on today but i took it
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
off to speak
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
i work about i worry about vaccinated
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
people who are gathering and pretending
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
things are all normal thinking that
 
02:05:50.079 --> 02:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
things are all normal thinking that
they're

02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're at no risk to transmit the
 
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
lastly i think about isolation
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
we think twice about gathering with our
 
02:06:02.719 --> 02:06:03.910 align:start position:0%
we think twice about gathering with our
friends

02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
friends
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
the topic of vaccination will come up
 
02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.709 align:start position:0%
the topic of vaccination will come up
inevitably

02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
inevitably
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we feel embarrassed but why should
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
we it's time to stop that it's time to
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
educate the vaccinated people that
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
yeah well we're not more at risk than
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
you are
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
we find our own tribe we've i've found a
 
02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
lot of new friends today i don't know
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
them but they're already friends of mine
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
in closing i'd like to say that
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
we all must hold very strongly the
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
belief that we have a right to medical
 
02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:47.669 align:start position:0%
belief that we have a right to medical
freedom

02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
this is medical freedom for all
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're at
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
peril and i'd like to use the phrase
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
that my
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
niece has used in the past
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
she has already lost her job at mass
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
general hospital she's a medical
 
02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:11.430 align:start position:0%
general hospital she's a medical
oncologist

02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
oncologist
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
she feels that her body is more
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
important than a job
 
02:07:15.679 --> 02:07:17.189 align:start position:0%
important than a job
she's

02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
she's
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
given up her job and will be looking for
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
she uses the phrase dark and sinister
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
and i use that phrase a lot now what is
 
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
happening now is dark and sinister
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
be careful of what is going to follow
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're living in a dark and sinister
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
world if we allow these things to happen
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you gary any questions for mr york
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much sir
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your son and daughter
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
service in the healthcare field
 
02:08:08.410 --> 02:08:08.420 align:start position:0%

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.589 align:start position:0%
 
hi

02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for holding
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
this discussion could you speak step a
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
little closer to them thank you thank
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
you to the committee for holding this
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on such an important topic
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
and also thank you to the many speakers
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
for your eloquence and passion which is
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
so inspiring to me personally
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
so my name is risa evans and i live in
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
kentucky with my
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
husband and daughter and our dogs
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
i'm a lawyer and i also teach over at
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
the law school i teach legal writing
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
as you may know the university of new
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire recently mandated vaccines for
 
02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
all employees because it is a federal
 
02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:57.830 align:start position:0%
all employees because it is a federal
contractor

02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
so as will become obvious the views that
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
i am expressing here today are my own
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
and not my employers
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
i think that vaccine mandates and
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports are a terrible idea
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
and that the censorship coercion
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
discrimination and scapegoating that
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
surround them pose a far greater threat
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
to humanity than does covet 19 itself
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the committee has heard a lot of
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
testimony very compelling about the
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
individual costs of these mandates and i
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
would like to just spend a few minutes
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
talking about how the costs to society
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
far outweigh any claimed public health
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
benefits and why we should do everything
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
that we can here in new hampshire to
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
keep vaccine mandates out
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
so first about the cost to society
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
i think we're all seeing as a result of
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
expanding system of vaccine mandates we
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
are increasingly becoming a segregated
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
two-tiered society
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important to fully
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
imagine what this means not just right
 
02:10:08.069 --> 02:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
now but also in the months and years
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
ahead if we don't put a stop to this so
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
let's do that
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
on the one hand we have people who for a
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
variety of very good reasons
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
have not and will not comply with the
 
02:10:20.079 --> 02:10:21.430 align:start position:0%
have not and will not comply with the
mandates

02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you fall into this category like so
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
many people here you find yourself
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
increasingly barred from your own life
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
as the efforts to obtain your compliance
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
lead to exclusion from key aspects of
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
civil society such as jobs schools
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
travel places of worship and more
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
and because government mandates are
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
always backed up by enforcement
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
mechanisms if the soft coercion doesn't
 
02:10:50.079 --> 02:10:51.350 align:start position:0%
mechanisms if the soft coercion doesn't
work

02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
down the road there's always the
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
possibility of force whatever that might
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
look like
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
so on the other hand we have people who
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
have complied with the mandates whether
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
under duress or because as it is for
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
many people vaccination was the right
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
choice for them
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
if you fall into this category society
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
is open to you you're free to access
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
education employment travel
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
entertainment and so on there's just one
 
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.350 align:start position:0%
entertainment and so on there's just one
catch

02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
catch
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
your medical passport needs to be fully
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
up to date
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
when it expires it's time for another
 
02:11:23.599 --> 02:11:24.790 align:start position:0%
when it expires it's time for another
booster

02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
booster
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
until you get that booster you no longer
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
count as fully vaccinated
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
and if you don't get it if you start to
 
02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
and if you don't get it if you start to
question

02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
the efficacy or safety or necessity for
 
02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
more boosters
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
you are relegated to the ranks of the
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
non-compliant with all that entails
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
now some people might say that however
 
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
dystopian this vision such a society is
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
worth it because vaccine mandates are
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect public health and
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
to end the pandemic
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
and on this point i would disagree
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
like many well-credentialed independent
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
scientists and physicians around the
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
globe i believe that the three public
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
health justifications that are claimed
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
in support of vaccine mandates just
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't cut it
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
first vaccine mandates can't and won't
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
lead to hurt immunity as evidenced by
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
israel and all the other countries with
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
high vaccination rates that still have
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
kobit coming back wave after wave it's
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
also unlikely because viral mutation and
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
animal reservoirs mean that it's going
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
to keep coming back in different forms
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
and there's also the possibility that
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
the vaccines themselves are driving
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
viral evolution towards vaccine
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
resistant variants so herd immunity is
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
not a justification
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
second vaccine mandates unfortunately do
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
not protect the vulnerable because the
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines as we know don't reliably
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
prevent infection and transmission so
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
they lead to a dangerous false sense of
 
02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
security it's like if you have three
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
guns and you know one of them is loaded
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
you have to treat them as if they're all
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
loaded right and it's the same thing we
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
can't distinguish between the treatment
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the vaccinated on the unvaccinated
 
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to the potential for spread
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
because we all can spread the virus
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
and finally vaccine mandates aren't
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep hospitals from
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
overflowing for a lot of reasons chief
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
among them the fact that there are early
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
treatment options for covid that can
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
help to keep people out of the hospital
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
if they do contract covid19 whether
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
they're vaccinated or not
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
so you might be thinking you know who
 
02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
who are you to make these assertions
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
right i'm not a doctor i'm not a
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
scientist and you're right i'm not um
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't expect anyone to believe my
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
conclusions about public health based on
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
my say so but i am a critical thinker
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
and so are you and so is everyone in
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
this room and this is where critical
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
thinking is really vital i think we all
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
have a duty to ask probing questions
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
when our personal health and civil
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
liberties and societal well-being are at
 
02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:03.910 align:start position:0%
liberties and societal well-being are at
stake

02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
stake
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
we have a duty to read and listen beyond
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
the simplistic messages of the
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
mainstream media sources and
 
02:14:11.199 --> 02:14:12.390 align:start position:0%
mainstream media sources and
institutions

02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
and we need to consider the many
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
intelligent and thoughtful independent
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
physicians and scientists around the
 
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
globe who speak from experience and who
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
have nothing to gain by their words
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
except that they want to help humanity
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
to people who say that we should leave
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
the thinking to the experts i say that's
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
balderdash in jury trials we ask lay
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
jurors to reach million dollar verdicts
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
all the time in medical malpractice
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
cases in patent cases we ask laypeople
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
to evaluate highly complex technical
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
medical and scientific information
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
jurors can do it we can do it you can do
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
it we have to do it this kind of
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
independent thinking is just too
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for coercion
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination scapegoating and
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
censorship there's no excuse for
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
systematically barring people from work
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
education travel religion and daily life
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
based on their vaccination status please
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
do your utmost to set us on a better

themselves and ask thoughtful questions
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
and make thoughtful decisions you all
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%

new hampshire vaccine association
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i understand this committee's charge
 
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
was to look at immunization policy as a
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
whole but certainly there's been a lot
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
of attention here today to covet and so
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give a shout out a thank
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
you to covid and for the coveted
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
vaccines for finally
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
bringing the much needed conversation
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
um to vaccine policy
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
and what needs to be addressed and what
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
needs to change
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
please know that mandates are not a part
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
of a civilized society
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
where there is risk
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
there must be choice
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
we all know that vaccines are not
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
without risk
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
in some of the prior testimony on other
 
02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:47.990 align:start position:0%
in some of the prior testimony on other
days

02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be considerable
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
confusion about
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedules
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
some people thought it was just a few
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines you know maybe three the
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
children got they didn't get it until
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
they were four or five years old
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
i can assure you it's more than three
 
02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:06.389 align:start position:0%
i can assure you it's more than three
vaccines

02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
the child vaccine schedule is now up to
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
72 doses of vaccines between birth and
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
you can look this up in the cdc website
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
they will provide you
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
with the schedules
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many pages it is what
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
is it 16 pages
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
this is the child vaccine schedule
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
and remember
 
02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about a shot such as
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
mmr that's three vaccines in one shot
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:44.309 --> 02:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
also what some people are now realizing
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
there's actually an adult vaccine
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
schedule as well
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
which is a new initiative by the federal
 
02:18:50.319 --> 02:18:51.429 align:start position:0%
which is a new initiative by the federal
government

02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
so now
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
adults are facing similar mandates to
 
02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.030 align:start position:0%
adults are facing similar mandates to
children

02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
sadly i got this piece of mail
 
02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:02.469 align:start position:0%
sadly i got this piece of mail
recently

02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
and it refers to the new hampshire
 
02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.709 align:start position:0%
and it refers to the new hampshire
simplified

02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
simplified
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
immunization schedule
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is not the new hampshire simplified
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
immunization schedule this is the cdc
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccine schedule
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
and it is misinformation to represent
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
that this is the schedule
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
that that has been approved and required
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire certain requirements on
 
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.429 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire certain requirements on
children

02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
for children in daycare
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
for children in school
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
there are 33 doses
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
of vaccines required
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to know on both of these
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
schedules and it's been touched on here
 
02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:52.550 align:start position:0%
schedules and it's been touched on here
today

02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
is natural immunity
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
from acquired disease infection in fact
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire laws and rules provide
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
for natural immunity for school children
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
and i will read here from the school
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for this coming year
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
documentation of immunity by confirmed
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
laboratory tests is acceptable for
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
measles mumps rubella
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
varicella and hepatitis b
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
natural immunity is recognized for those
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
viral illnesses it is time we recognize
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
it for
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
and and on that note
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
the the testing is for antibodies and i
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
hope that people will be mindful in
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
evaluating vaccines to bring them to
 
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
evaluating vaccines to bring them to
market

02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
the measure of
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
efficacy is based on a measure of
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
so if antibodies are good enough to
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
approve a vaccine for advocacy then
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
certainly they're good enough to
 
02:21:05.359 --> 02:21:06.630 align:start position:0%
certainly they're good enough to
demonstrate

02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
natural acquired immunity
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
i know that the representative lang one
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
of the concerns you had mentioned and
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
the reason for calling for this
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
committee is the vaccine requirements
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
imposed on foster families
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
i testified against those rules
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
they were not needed rules they were not
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
required rules by the federal law and i
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
could not find authority in new
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire statute to actually impose
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
those rules
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
when i require inquired of a jail car
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
attorney the statutory authority i was
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
told to ask dhhs when i asked dhhs their
 
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
attorney gave me no response
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
i could find no statutory authority for
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
those requirements
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
in fact what those requirements do and
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
the question was raised earlier
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
if those foster family rules for
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines require covet shots
 
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
indeed they do
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
they require coveted shots on children
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
all children at a foster family
 
02:22:10.319 --> 02:22:11.830 align:start position:0%
all children at a foster family
household

02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
household
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
not just foster children the biological
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
children who reside there and that is up
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
to age 21 so that includes 18 year olds
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
19 year olds and 20 year olds now must
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
have a covered shot
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i will read from a letter that was
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
issued by d
 
02:22:29.359 --> 02:22:30.230 align:start position:0%
issued by d
the

02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%

foster family services september 22nd
2020

02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
from the department
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
for all children residing in the home
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
if serving children under the age of six
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
or any child with
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
special medical needs
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
that could mean something simple as
 
02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:53.030 align:start position:0%
that could mean something simple as
asthma

02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
asthma
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
maybe learning disabilities
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
all vaccinations as recommended by the
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule available on the cdc
 
02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:01.349 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule available on the cdc
website

02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
you might be aware committee members
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the advisor committee and
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
immunization practices just recently
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
recommended the coveted shots for
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
children aged 5 through 11.
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
that now imposes that mandate on foster
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
family children
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
so i hope that addresses that that
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
then there is a and it should be mindful
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
too the requirement for foster families
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
please be aware that foster
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
parents who lose their children to the
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
foster system do not lose their parental
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
rights their rights to make medical
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
decisions for their children barring a
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
court order
 
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
so any notion that these vaccines simply
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
could be imposed on these foster
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
children is wrong
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
legally wrong
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
there is and i know that this committee
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
is charged with looking at all
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
immunization policy
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
so i would like you to look at
 
02:24:09.439 --> 02:24:10.150 align:start position:0%
so i would like you to look at
the

02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
under rsa 141c
 
02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
these kovichotts
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
aren't immunizations
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
i shall read the definition of
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
immunization from statute
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
immunization means inoculation
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
with a specific antigen
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
to promote antibody formation in the
 
02:24:33.359 --> 02:24:34.389 align:start position:0%
to promote antibody formation in the
body

02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
body
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
none of the coveted shots contain
 
02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:38.389 align:start position:0%
none of the coveted shots contain
antigen

02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
antigen
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
they do not meet the definition of
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
immunization under new hampshire statute
 
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of things to to look
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
at um and and clean up in law
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire laws should provide for
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
natural immunity
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
it is the science
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
we need to have barefoot verifiable data
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
from dhhs on disease cases illness and
 
02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:06.070 align:start position:0%
from dhhs on disease cases illness and
deaths

02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
individual families must be able to
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
verify these records we certainly hold a
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
lot of people accountable for a lot of
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
things but when i look at
 
02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:16.630 align:start position:0%
things but when i look at
the

02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
cova dashboard and i see here
 
02:25:22.349 --> 02:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
that dhhs has reported
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
1597 total deaths to covet there's no
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
way to verify that
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't even know if a family
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
member who passed away was one of those
 
02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
member who passed away was one of those
numbers

02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
there and you might wish to dispute it
 
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
there is no way to verify this and audit
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
it and that is a sorely needed
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
checks and balance that we need here
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
to verify that information
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
because and and quite honestly dhhs has
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
far less information
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
on what they report
 
02:25:57.830 --> 02:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
than the vera system the vaccine adverse
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
event reporting system
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
that i know some people
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
are doubtful about and don't quite
 
02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:11.670 align:start position:0%
are doubtful about and don't quite
understand

02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
laura i just asked you to kind of wrap
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
it up a little bit you've done over 10
 
02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
minutes down because i'm getting to the
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
bottom of the pile here
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
um so really this is and and i want
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
people to be aware the vaccine adverse
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
event reporting system
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
is the system that the cdc uses to track
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
adverse events
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
the covert vaccine now reports eighteen
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
thousand seventy eight deaths
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
fifty seven of those are in new
 
02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:39.190 align:start position:0%
fifty seven of those are in new
hampshire

02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
there have been zero child deaths from
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
coveted reported new hampshire
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
and two child deaths in new hampshire
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
as far as the burden on hospitals i know
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
that some people have talked about the
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
burden of covet illness in hospitals
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
please be mindful
 
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
that the vaccines the vaccine adverse
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
reporting system have reported
 
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
almost eighty nine thousand
 
02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:08.870 align:start position:0%
almost eighty nine thousand
hospitalizations

02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
and nearly ninety six thousand urgent
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
care visits
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
so certainly the effects of vaccination
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
are now without an impact on our health
 
02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:21.030 align:start position:0%
are now without an impact on our health
system

02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
what we should also know in those fears
 
02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:24.150 align:start position:0%
what we should also know in those fears
numbers

02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
one of the the things that was rolled
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
out in the beginning when um medical
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
providers were were getting these shots
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
they were given a system called v safe
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
it is a cell phone based system where
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
they will report adverse effects
 
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
and i've talked to some of those people
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
and they said oh sure i reported to
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
veers it was on my cell phone i said no
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
you reported to vsafe did you report to
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
viirs well no i did v-safe so these
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
numbers reciting from veers don't
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
include the adverse effects reported to
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
be safe
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
so those numbers are
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.319 --> 02:28:03.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:03.359 --> 02:28:06.950 align:start position:0%
so
in

02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
wrapping up here i want to remind people
 
02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
that vaccines are not without
 
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
risk of failure
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
and risk of significant harm including
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
death and i remind you
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
two children
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
have died in new hampshire following
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccination
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
none ever died from covet itself
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
vaccines are not hair nets
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
as you've heard in testimony on another
 
02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:33.830 align:start position:0%
as you've heard in testimony on another
day

02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines permanently alter your body
 
02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
many times not for the better they're
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
not something you can take off when you
 
02:28:43.270 --> 02:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
go home from work
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
vaccines are truly not hair nuts
 
02:28:46.479 --> 02:28:47.830 align:start position:0%
vaccines are truly not hair nuts
voluntary

02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:49.190 align:start position:0%
voluntary
works

02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
we have evidence of that through the new
 
02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire vaccine association
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
76 percent of the budget spent on child
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines in new hampshire are for
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are consumed on a
 
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:07.510 --> 02:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
when shots are free available everywhere
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
if they are truly
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
safe and effective
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
people will line up for them no van no
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
mandates are needed
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
and let me wrap up with a reminder where
 
02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
there is risk there must be choice and i
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
hope with covid and the coveted vaccines
 
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
this will finally move the needle on
 
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
that and recognize there should be
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
choice for all
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
all vaccines thank you
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%

02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you you're all set laura
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
so laura i will just give you an update
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
i filed a petition with hhs to reopen
 
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
the foster family
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
they replied back they're not reopening
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
that rule because they are not mandating
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
a coveted vaccine for foster families
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
that was their interpretation i'll deal
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
with that later i'm just letting you
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
thomas mcleod
 
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
a couple added so i think we have nine
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
more speakers at this point
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
my goal would be to considering it's 11
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
30 is just to run through the nine
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%

02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
we saw the writing on the wall and we
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
understood that
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
it was a politically unsafe
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
environment and unsafe environment to be
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
raising children
 
02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:09.670 align:start position:0%

my associates and i
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
hosted a conference on health freedom
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
where we just invited speakers to talk
 
02:31:23.359 --> 02:31:24.230 align:start position:0%
where we just invited speakers to talk
about

02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy and the science behind
 
02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:31.830 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy and the science behind
vaccination

02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
the hostility
 
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
and the threats coming from
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
the media
 
02:31:40.319 --> 02:31:41.190 align:start position:0%
the media
and

02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
members of the community and this was in
 
02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
stowe vermont were so extreme
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
that the conference had to be
 
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's when i decided i had had enough
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
so i just want to uh speak briefly about
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
three subjects our organization has
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
assisted about 60
 
02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:08.469 align:start position:0%
assisted about 60
employees

02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
with um with their requests for
 
02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
religious uh accommodation under title
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:21.270 align:start position:0%
vii of the civil rights act in 1964
and

02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
i had i have to say that
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is tremendous amount of
 
02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:26.870 align:start position:0%
there is tremendous amount of
misinformation

02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
about these exempt so-called exemptions
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is coming from the employers
 
02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is coming from the employers
themselves

02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is coming from
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
various government entities
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh for example uh many employers are
 
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
being told if you if you don't have a
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
letter from your
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh clergy then you can't get an
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
exemption or if your if your uh
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%

02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
a vaccine doesn't fit into a three-line
 
02:33:01.120 --> 02:33:02.389 align:start position:0%

02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:06.389 align:start position:0%
on a form then you can't get a religious
exact

02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
exact
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
exemption etc etc
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
the cases that i've seen
 
02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:14.710 align:start position:0%
the cases that i've seen
where

02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
employees have
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
filed a
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
fully described
 
02:33:20.399 --> 02:33:21.429 align:start position:0%
fully described
uh

02:33:21.429 --> 02:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
description of their religious beliefs
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
and how that
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
impacted their decision to refuse the
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine have mostly been granted
 
02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
it takes a tremendous amount of effort
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
and research to write one of these
 
02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:40.389 align:start position:0%
and research to write one of these
and

02:33:40.389 --> 02:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that laws would
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
regulation is in order
 
02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
to prevent
 
02:33:49.270 --> 02:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
employers from misinforming employees
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
the universal declaration of bioethics
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
and human rights
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
was a
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
u.n declaration that was put in place in
 
02:34:06.399 --> 02:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
u.n declaration that was put in place in
2005

02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
2005
 
02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
ratified by
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%

this document defines uh consent at
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
as being prior free
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
and informed and it is there to protect
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
not the doctor not the medical
 
02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:28.870 align:start position:0%
not the doctor not the medical
researcher

02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
but today in new hampshire as in many
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
states we have
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh informed consent but the informed
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
consent is there to protect the
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner from liability
 
02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:40.790 align:start position:0%
practitioner from liability
or

02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
a medical researcher from charges of
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
unethical conduct
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
we need a definition
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
of informed consent that protects the
 
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy of the individual
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
not the practitioner and
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
introduced

02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
attempted to do that
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
now we're having this committee
 
02:35:07.359 --> 02:35:08.630 align:start position:0%
now we're having this committee
to

02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:10.309 align:start position:0%
to
review

02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
review
 
02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
and to define what a medical
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
intervention is
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
because we seem to have failed to do
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
that with the version of hp 220 that
 
02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:20.950 align:start position:0%
that with the version of hp 220 that
passed

02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
so a working definition
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
of what a medical intervention is is any
 
02:35:27.990 --> 02:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
procedure or action that breaks or
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
passes through the skin
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
bodily or bodily orifice for the purpose
 
02:35:33.439 --> 02:35:34.389 align:start position:0%
bodily or bodily orifice for the purpose
of

02:35:34.389 --> 02:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
diagnosing testing treatment
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
or prevention of any disease or medical
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
condition it's really that simple
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that includes any injection of a
 
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.750 align:start position:0%
so that includes any injection of a
pharmaceutical

02:35:47.750 --> 02:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
any surgery
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation which is
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
added added to the water to
 
02:35:57.270 --> 02:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
prevent dental caries
 
02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
it does not include
 
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
routine vision and hearing tests
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
a routine
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
physical for employment or school
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
it does not include a 24-week ultrasound
 
02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
does not include a breathalyzer test it
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
does not include
 
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
and there is a gray area having to do
 
02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:20.950 align:start position:0%
and there is a gray area having to do
with

02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh manipulations uh such as chiropractic
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
routine chiropractic adjustments
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i i'd like to
 
02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:30.309 align:start position:0%
so i i'd like to
[Music]

02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
start with a definition like that
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
right now just to wrap up right now we
 
02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:43.190 align:start position:0%
right now just to wrap up right now we
have

02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
virtually no protections
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh for individuals when their informed
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
consent has been violated
 
02:36:53.830 --> 02:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
in 2019 a woman
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
brought her child to a pediatrician in
 
02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:57.510 align:start position:0%
brought her child to a pediatrician in
nashua

02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
and refused a vaccine
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
they actually
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
locked the door and prevented her from
 
02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.670 align:start position:0%
locked the door and prevented her from
leaving

02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
until she signed a an aap waiver
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
she refused to sign the waiver and she
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
had to call 9-1-1 in order to be let out
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
where i'm going with that is
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
if you ask a hospital administrator
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
do patients have
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
the absolute right to refuse
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
a medical treatment a recommendation
 
02:37:44.469 --> 02:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times you'll get a very
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
great answer they'll say something like
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
well it's a it's a group decision uh
 
02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
well it's it's a decision made by the
 
02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:54.150 align:start position:0%
well it's it's a decision made by the
team

02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
team
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's really not the question
 
02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
does the individual have
 
02:38:02.469 --> 02:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
the liberty interest does it do they
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
have the right in and of themselves
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
to to make that choice
 
02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:08.790 align:start position:0%
to to make that choice
to

02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:11.429 align:start position:0%
to
refuse

02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
refuse
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
and as we don't have that choice right
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
now the hospital
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
makes the choice for us and
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
and they will
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh very often times uh become coercive
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
when they when the individual doesn't
 
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
make the choice that they want you to
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
make they don't uh they'll they'll cut
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
back visitation or they'll prevent you
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
from calling a lawyer or or they'll make
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
things difficult for you in many other
 
02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.670 align:start position:0%
things difficult for you in many other
ways

02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
ways
 
02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:40.630 align:start position:0%
ways
so

02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
this is absolutely essential
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
that informed consent be defined
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
as an individual right and individual
 
02:38:52.630 --> 02:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
liberty to protect bodily autonomy
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll wrap up if there are
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mcleod any questions or mr
 
02:38:58.399 --> 02:39:00.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mcleod any questions or mr

not seeing any we're all set thank you
 
02:39:05.370 --> 02:39:05.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%

02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
butcher that last name
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:23.670 align:start position:0%
butcher that last name
larue

02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:26.309 --> 02:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
so while david's coming up i did want to
 
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
the goal of this committee was not
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily to focus on just
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
immunizations it was where in state law
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
we currently have medical interventions
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
where we have shalls and shall not in
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
law where the government says you must
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
do this or the government says you
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
cannot do that and that could be either
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
in federal in state law could be in in
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
state rules is what we're looking to
 
02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
expand upon here in addition to the
 
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
immunization question so house bill 220
 
02:39:51.510 --> 02:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
which is a bill i've sponsored was the
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
beginning of this conversation um and it
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh that bill uh banned government from
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
mandating on a broad basis uh
 
02:40:00.870 --> 02:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations as a condition of
 
02:40:03.750 --> 02:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
participating in society so as you're
 
02:40:05.349 --> 02:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
testifying as we're talking again our
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
goal here was to to look at larger you
 
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
know we know there are some places where
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
medical interventions are warranted i
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a former police officer so i use
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
things like
 
02:40:16.950 --> 02:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
a suicidal person right there's a reason
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
for a law enforcement officer make that
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
person get some mental health care and
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
put them in into a facility to allow
 
02:40:24.150 --> 02:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
them to get the treatment they need at
 
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
least initially so they're not suicidal
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
and not walk away from them so there's a
 
02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
case of medical intervention another
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
case of i use is corrections right so if
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have a inmate who gets stabbed on in
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the in prison you're not going to
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
walk away from that inmate while
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
they need medical care the corrections
 
02:40:42.550 --> 02:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
is going to get them stitched up so they
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
don't bleed out on the floor
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we talk about some
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
simple things in everyday life things
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
like someone who's heavily intoxicated
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
where they may go and put a way to be
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
dried out or put put it so they don't
 
02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
have alcohol poisoning as again as a
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
former police officer it's not uncommon
 
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
for me to bring somebody to hospital and
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
say check their blood make sure they're
 
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
not at levels for death
 
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
before we go and just take them to the
 
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
jail to sober up so again non-uncommon
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
so we're looking for areas in law around
 
02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
there and rules that are beyond the
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
simple immunization um which we've been
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
talking mostly of today so just as uh if
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
anybody has goes home and thinks about
 
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
things like that if you could uh feel
 
02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
free to email the committee so we have
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
that information sorry david didn't mean
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
to rep you go ahead all right uh my name
 
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
is david lebru i am from alexandria and
 
02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:28.870 align:start position:0%
is david lebru i am from alexandria and
uh

02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know i'd love to talk broad scale
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
because i think that's really uh
 
02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
where we're at
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
we can nickel and dime the minutia of
 
02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
your evidence versus my evidence your
 
02:41:41.349 --> 02:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
science versus my science you have a
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
doctor we have a doctor we can go back
 
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
and forth until perpetuity comes okay
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
that is not the question here the
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
question is broadly is this right is
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
this moral is this how our government
 
02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
should operate
 
02:41:56.230 --> 02:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i've been thinking as i've been
 
02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
sitting who should i talk to this
 
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee in this audience as
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
should i speak as a person who has a
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
child on the way
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
should i speak as somebody who's an
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
off-grid homesteader should i speak to
 
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who is a new hampshire state
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
certified emt should i speak as somebody

transformation and used to have
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
comorbidities should i speak as somebody

02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
helping people
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
to become more healthy to avoid all
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
medical problems
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%

02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
group fitness training who has been a
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
lifeguard do i speak as a blue-collar
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
worker who for the first year and some
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
change of this i drove a garbage truck

and plowed snow
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
i was the one picking up the dumpsters
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
full of mass full of this supposed
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
biohazard we got no incentive pay we got
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
no hazard pay
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%

02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:00.309 align:start position:0%
we were given no special uh
ppe

02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
ppe
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
who do i speak to you as do i speak to
 
02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
you as a blue collar joe joe american
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
that is the question because we all come
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
from different places but all of us are
 
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
covered under the constitution the bill
 
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
of rights
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
all men are created equal we have
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
recognized that we have had inequities
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
and we have had minority groups who have
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
advocated that they were not being
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
treated fairly just in this room right
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
there we have multiple signs evidence of
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination face covering required
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
i was so excited because i was able to
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
actually stop and drink out of the
 
02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
public water fountain because last time
 
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
i went to my newfound school board
 
02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
meeting i was not allowed to drink from
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
the public water fountain because it was
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:55.830 --> 02:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
are we working towards masked or
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
unmasked seating for our reps are we
 
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
working towards vacs or unvac seating if
 
02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
these kind of interventions generally
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
continue to be applied
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
i spent a month
 
02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
on the roadside outside of dartmouth
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
hitchcock in lebanon and i met countless
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
nurses practitioners l a's
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
people who work in the hospital in
 
02:44:21.429 --> 02:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
sanitation in food
 
02:44:23.510 --> 02:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
all saying the same thing
 
02:44:26.150 --> 02:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock health is broadly is
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
the second largest employer in the state
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's only behind the actual state they
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
are the largest private employer
 
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
and it has grieved my heart and many of
 
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
the people that i know i am in this room
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
with because i have known them and stood
 
02:44:42.150 --> 02:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
with them since dartmouth hitchcock
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
health brought out their medical
 
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
mandates and it grieves me that these
 
02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
conversations in action and in a real
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
spotlight on these issues has only been
 
02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
brought after it was a red versus blue
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
federal versus state issue
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
the time to stand was when the largest
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
employer in the state made a policy that
 
02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:04.070 align:start position:0%
employer in the state made a policy that
said

02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
you will vaccinate
 
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
apply for some kind of an exemption
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
which may or may not be granted and then
 
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
when we get done deciding whether or not
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
your religion is valid
 
02:45:18.550 --> 02:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
we may or may not fire you and by
 
02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
signing on to this you have now agreed
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
to your own termination
 
02:45:24.790 --> 02:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
please tell me who makes occupational
 
02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
health the arbiter of your religion in
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
this country
 
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
i have a friend who has had the um
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccine
 
02:45:36.389 --> 02:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
as a religious exemption
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
she was approved by her employer for a
 
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
religious exemption for the influenza
 
02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:42.469 align:start position:0%
religious exemption for the influenza
vaccine

02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
and then she was denied a religious
 
02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:46.309 align:start position:0%
and then she was denied a religious
exemption

02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
and now no longer works for that
 
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to read some numbers
 
02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:54.950 align:start position:0%
i'd like to read some numbers
okay

02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:56.469 --> 02:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
i will speak to you as a critical
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
thinker as joe blow
 
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
this is from
 
02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:04.469 align:start position:0%
this is from
covid19.nh.gov

02:46:04.469 --> 02:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
backslash dashboard
 
02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
i have followed this website
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
since last march
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
since it came up march april whenever
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
this came up when we had less than 200
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
cases in the state
 
02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:19.590 align:start position:0%
cases in the state
okay

02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:46:22.630 --> 02:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
all of these numbers i recorded off of
 
02:46:25.269 --> 02:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
this official.gov site when i was
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
sitting there these are the most current
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
numbers the actual state will provide us
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
google states that new hampshire has a
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
population from the 2019 census of 1.36
 
02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:40.230 align:start position:0%
population from the 2019 census of 1.36
million

02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
i've heard it's about 1.4 million i did
 
02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
some math while i was sitting there
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
we'll use 1.3 million when i tell you
 
02:46:50.230 --> 02:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
these numbers so these numbers will
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
higher percentages than the truth
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
in 1.3 million
 
02:46:59.190 --> 02:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire in 18 months
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
give or take we have been dealing with
 
02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:01.750 align:start position:0%
give or take we have been dealing with
this

02:47:01.750 --> 02:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
we have had 139
 
02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
324 cases
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
in 18 months
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
we have barely had 10.5 the exact number
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
is 10.71 but as i say this is a little
 
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
inflated because i rounded the
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
population down 10 of new hampshire has
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
even tested positive in over a year and
 
02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
a half yet i hear people say we don't
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
want this to continue forever this is
 
02:47:29.349 --> 02:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
not a long-term thing this is not about
 
02:47:31.349 --> 02:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
getting booster shots into perpetuity
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
this is not about making people test
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
forever this isn't going to hang around
 
02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:36.309 align:start position:0%
forever this isn't going to hang around
forever

02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
forever
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
well how long is it going to take before
 
02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
enough people have heard immunity or we
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
have tested or we've beat this dead
 
02:47:44.590 --> 02:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
horse into submission and the
 
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals have enough money that
 
02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
we can no longer continue this
 
02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:50.790 align:start position:0%
we can no longer continue this
hospitalizations

02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations
 
02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:54.880 align:start position:0%

02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
the total cases is the only percentage i
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
will read you that does not start with a
 
02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:07.510 align:start position:0%
will read you that does not start with a
zero

02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
one thousand nine hundred thirty five uh
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations of 1.3 million people
 
02:48:14.319 --> 02:48:17.429 align:start position:0%

02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
why do we have hospitals to treat people
 
02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
that are sick the hospitals are doing
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
i see you
 
02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:25.269 align:start position:0%
i see you
597

02:48:25.269 --> 02:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
597
 
02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
people out of 1.3 million
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
in 18 months
 
02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:30.710 align:start position:0%
in 18 months
zero

02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
zero
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
point here's another zero
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
0.045 percentage of new hampshire has
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
been hospitalized with this
 
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
zero 0.12

02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:48.309 --> 02:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
look i'm not a cold person
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
many of you who have heard me speak
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
before i get broken to tears because i
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
am equal parts unhappy with our
 
02:48:58.950 --> 02:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
government and heartbroken for my nation
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
this brings me to tears but it is not
 
02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
lost on me that i have no grandparents
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
left my father has been dead for years
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
on 34. it did not take covid or some
 
02:49:10.710 --> 02:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
miraculous novel virus that is so
 
02:49:12.870 --> 02:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
contagious that in 18 months we've
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
barely scratched 10 of the population
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay it did not take any of that for all
 
02:49:20.870 --> 02:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
of my family members
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
in that rig regard to already have
 
02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:24.550 align:start position:0%
in that rig regard to already have
passed

02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:49:25.710 --> 02:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
1597 deaths
 
02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:29.429 align:start position:0%
1597 deaths
60

02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
60
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
are in long-term care
 
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
now objectively let's take the feelings
 
02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
out of this because we don't legislate
 
02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
on feelings we don't do medicine on
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
feelings we do evidence-based medicine
 
02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
we legislate on what is statistically
 
02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
significant we make policy of laws not
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
mandates we legislate and the public
 
02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
gets comment i will not thank you and
 
02:49:53.110 --> 02:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
this is not a disrespect but i will not
 
02:49:56.230 --> 02:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for being allowed public input
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
on things that are going to affect us
 
02:50:00.870 --> 02:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is the requirement i will thank you
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
guys for coming
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
okay 60 long-term care objectively who
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
is in long-term care
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
people who are not just elderly
 
02:50:13.429 --> 02:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
often elderly but people who are already
 
02:50:17.429 --> 02:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
sickly for a whole variety of reasons
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
and objectively closer to death
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
as i heard it said when the great johnny
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
cash died when i was in high school that
 
02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
he had one foot in the grave and the
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
other on a banana peel that is just a
 
02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
statistical fact
 
02:50:31.279 --> 02:50:33.429 align:start position:0%
statistical fact
okay

02:50:33.429 --> 02:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:50:36.389 --> 02:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
of the long-term care settings this
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
website also breakdowns
 
02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers
 
02:50:44.910 --> 02:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
we have had 11 healthcare workers die
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
0.7 percent
 
02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
of those uh sorry i forgot which number
 
02:50:52.389 --> 02:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
that was but 11 hospital workers have
 
02:50:52.399 --> 02:50:53.269 align:start position:0%
that was but 11 hospital workers have
died

02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
died
 
02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
thrown everywhere as the hospitals are
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
so high risk
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
we need to force all of this stuff in 18
 
02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
months we've had 11 hospital workers or
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
long-term care uh people
 
02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:07.670 align:start position:0%
long-term care uh people
die

02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
die
 
02:51:11.429 --> 02:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
now under 30 because what is coming if
 
02:51:13.750 --> 02:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
medical interventions are continued to
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
be pushed as legitimate without proper
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
informed consent by coercive measures if
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
these things are continued we will be
 
02:51:23.830 --> 02:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
talking about children's vaccines maybe
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
in a few weeks in a few months
 
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
under 30 years old
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
and up until very recently the number
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
was zero but it shows now from nh.gov or
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
the the gov website that we have had two
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
deaths under 30.
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
it is widely known that almost
 
02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:44.070 align:start position:0%
it is widely known that almost
everyone

02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
statistically significant has had not
 
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
one not two but multiple comorbidities
 
02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
or has already been somebody who is very
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
sick who it has
 
02:51:56.230 --> 02:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
real health problems
 
02:51:58.150 --> 02:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
now what is the average life expectancy
 
02:52:01.510 --> 02:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire google says it is 79.4
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
give or take
 
02:52:06.150 --> 02:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
we also on this website government data
 
02:52:10.230 --> 02:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
have an 80 plus category
 
02:52:12.710 --> 02:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
80 plus
 
02:52:14.830 --> 02:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
accounts for
 
02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:16.710 align:start position:0%
accounts for
59.1

02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
59.1
 
02:52:18.790 --> 02:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
of deaths
 
02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
better than half and up until a couple
 
02:52:22.870 --> 02:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
days ago it was over 60
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
and this 60 to 65 rough number has been
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with both long-term care and
 
02:52:32.550 --> 02:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
age category since last year if you can
 
02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
find some data from the previous years
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
those percentages have been very very
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
similar within a few percentage points
 
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much always been about 60 of
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
people whether we had 200 cases or 139
 
02:52:45.359 --> 02:52:46.309 align:start position:0%
people whether we had 200 cases or 139
000.

02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
000.
 
02:52:48.230 --> 02:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
60 of people are already over the
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
average life expectancy i have relatives
 
02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
who are over the average life expectancy
 
02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
there are people probably people in this
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
room or in the legislature who are also
 
02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
over the average life expectancy but if
 
02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
you are beyond that point what does that
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
actually mean
 
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
really statistically
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
it means you are less likely to survive
 
02:53:09.750 --> 02:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
the day than you are from anything cove
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.950 --> 02:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
under 30 i didn't read you the
 
02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
percentage keep track count on your
 
02:53:18.800 --> 02:53:19.670 align:start position:0%
percentage keep track count on your
fingers

02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
fingers
 
02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:24.550 align:start position:0%
fingers
0.00015

02:53:24.550 --> 02:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of our deaths in this state
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
in 18 months have been people under the
 
02:53:33.349 --> 02:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to finish with this my own
 
02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:38.870 align:start position:0%
i'm going to finish with this my own

02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
quote
 
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
it was said earlier about these great
 
02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
photographs and our forefathers and how
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
the government is supposed to operate
 
02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
be a man and a person and a legislator
 
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
and a leader that our forefathers would
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
not have been ashamed to stand in a room
 
02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:57.590 align:start position:0%
not have been ashamed to stand in a room
with

02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:59.030 --> 02:53:59.040 align:start position:0%

going to have
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
one or two more
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
of these hearings this week
 
02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
there will be a second public
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
information session or input session on
 
02:54:28.230 --> 02:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
wednesday um depending on who shows up
 
02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
we'll either move into having a
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
discussion about what we've heard or
 
02:54:32.790 --> 02:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
we'll hear testimony from people that
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
show up
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:54:40.469 --> 02:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
if say only i showed up you would have a
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
second session
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have the second session no
 
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
matter what it just depends whether
 
02:54:46.830 --> 02:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
there's anybody there to speak yep
 
02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:48.550 align:start position:0%
there's anybody there to speak yep
okay

02:54:48.550 --> 02:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
now my second question is
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
would i be permitted to make a statement
 
02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:55.110 align:start position:0%
would i be permitted to make a statement
now

02:54:55.110 --> 02:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:54:57.670 --> 02:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
on a certain aspect of this issue and
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
then make a second one
 
02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:55:05.110 --> 02:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:06.710 align:start position:0%
sure
okay

02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:14.309 --> 02:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
i am going to speak
 
02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
you have just heard from david larue
 
02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.550 align:start position:0%
you have just heard from david larue
that

02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's an absurdity in the air he
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
didn't say that precisely himself but
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
you could feel it in what he was saying
 
02:55:39.750 --> 02:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
that there is a sense of an intense
 
02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:41.630 align:start position:0%
that there is a sense of an intense
orwellian

02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
orwellian
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
absurdity in the air around this issue
 
02:55:47.349 --> 02:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
and it's because of the types of things
 
02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
that david was describing
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
that are taking place everywhere all
 
02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
now why is this
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh while i'm on the subject of the globe
 
02:56:02.230 --> 02:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
i might as well mention global
 
02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:04.389 align:start position:0%
i might as well mention global
financiers

02:56:04.389 --> 02:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
financiers
 
02:56:07.269 --> 02:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
and uh rather than this being this this
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
favorite um kind of weaponized uh term
 
02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theory
 
02:56:16.230 --> 02:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
this is not a conspiracy theory
 
02:56:19.349 --> 02:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:19.359 --> 02:56:20.309 align:start position:0%
 
mr

02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
mr
 
02:56:22.870 --> 02:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
bill gates
 
02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
is one of those financiers big time
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
and bill gates has everything to do
 
02:56:33.429 --> 02:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
with this vaccination program with the
 
02:56:35.190 --> 02:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
entire covid
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh deception
 
02:56:38.830 --> 02:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
that is taking place
 
02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:40.389 align:start position:0%
that is taking place
globally

02:56:40.389 --> 02:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
globally
 
02:56:43.110 --> 02:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
and this is shameful it is shameful that
 
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
02:56:47.190 --> 02:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
would become
 
02:56:50.309 --> 02:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
a nation of censorship
 
02:56:52.230 --> 02:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
over an issue like this
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
what have we become
 
02:56:56.309 --> 02:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
what have we become
 
02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
george orwell wrote his novels
 
02:57:02.309 --> 02:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
not as fantasy stories even the novel
 
02:57:04.870 --> 02:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
animal farm was not really a fantasy
 
02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
story at all
 
02:57:08.870 --> 02:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
his novel
 
02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
his novel
1984

02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
1984
 
02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
was a precise manual for stalinism
 
02:57:18.550 --> 02:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
it was a precise down to the detail
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
description of how stalinism works and
 
02:57:24.389 --> 02:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
what do we see today
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
over the covet issue
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
but this is stalinism it's imported
 
02:57:32.309 --> 02:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
directly partially through the red
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
chinese system
 
02:57:35.110 --> 02:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
we see
 
02:57:37.990 --> 02:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
the red shine it's it's really the red
 
02:57:41.349 --> 02:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
chinese uh what do you call it social
 
02:57:45.429 --> 02:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
credit system that's being enacted
 
02:57:48.150 --> 02:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing red chinese purges
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
being enacted
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me sir
 
02:57:52.950 --> 02:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
i apologize for interrupt can i just
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
have you know just step up to the mic
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
someone online just said they can't hear
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
what you're saying because you're not
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
near the mic
 
02:58:01.349 --> 02:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
this is actually a gigantic red chinese
 
02:58:04.630 --> 02:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
purge and it's a red chinese style i
 
02:58:06.070 --> 02:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
mean i
 
02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
i should say style
 
02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:09.990 align:start position:0%
i should say style
um

02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
cultural revolution what happened in the
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
red chinese cultural revolution
 
02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:16.950 align:start position:0%
red chinese cultural revolution
but

02:58:16.950 --> 02:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:58:18.550 --> 02:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
an entire
 
02:58:22.630 --> 02:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
legacy of history an entire legacy of
 
02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:24.070 align:start position:0%
legacy of history an entire legacy of
religions

02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
religions
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
was totally demolished
 
02:58:29.110 --> 02:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're seeing our culture in the of the
 
02:58:31.750 --> 02:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
united states being demolished just the
 
02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:32.550 align:start position:0%
united states being demolished just the
same

02:58:32.550 --> 02:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:58:36.870 --> 02:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i would like to to uh thank god
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
himself that we're able to still
 
02:58:42.630 --> 02:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
have a setting here such as we see right
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
now today where
 
02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
citizens still can
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
physically stand up and speak
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
to folks like you on a committee
 
02:58:57.670 --> 02:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
i thank god for this because we are
 
02:59:00.550 --> 02:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
getting close we are getting very close
 
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
to the point where this will not even be
 
02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:05.110 align:start position:0%
to the point where this will not even be
something

02:59:05.110 --> 02:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:59:10.389 --> 02:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:12.630 --> 02:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
and okay
 
02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
general stark
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
is the author
 
02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so the general star so sir
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
they need you to speak into the
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
microphone because the online people can
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
that are watching this remotely can hear
 
02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:27.990 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
okay

02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
i i i just assumed because of the very
 
02:59:33.190 --> 02:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
poor uh speaker system in this room that
 
02:59:36.870 --> 02:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
it would be better at a distance okay
 
02:59:38.950 --> 02:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
general stark
 
02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
is the author of the new hampshire motto
 
02:59:45.590 --> 02:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
which is live free or die and many
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
people don't know that general stark
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
also mentioned
 
02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
when he said that
 
02:59:55.349 --> 02:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
that there are things that are worse
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
than death or sickness or that sort of
 
02:59:58.319 --> 02:59:59.110 align:start position:0%
than death or sickness or that sort of
thing

02:59:59.110 --> 02:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:00:00.950 --> 03:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
he mentioned that there are things that
 
03:00:03.670 --> 03:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
are much worse
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and what we're seeing taking place as a
 
03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
result of this coveted global nonsense
 
03:00:13.349 --> 03:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
is something that is much worse than
 
03:00:13.359 --> 03:00:15.910 align:start position:0%
is something that is much worse than
death

03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
our forefathers
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
fought and died
 
03:00:23.190 --> 03:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
for the principles that are being
 
03:00:25.990 --> 03:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely trashed
 
03:00:27.910 --> 03:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and in the
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
united states of america
 
03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:32.309 align:start position:0%
united states of america
trashed

03:00:32.309 --> 03:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
trashed
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
over a little bug that's supposed to get
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
us all
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
scared and benjamin franklin is reputed
 
03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
to have said uh it's not actually
 
03:00:45.910 --> 03:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
written down in his writings but he's
 
03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
reputed to have said to a lot of his
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
friends that those who
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
would sacrifice
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
those who would trade away
 
03:00:58.469 --> 03:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
their god-given rights
 
03:00:58.479 --> 03:01:00.309 align:start position:0%
their god-given rights
for

03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:01:04.830 --> 03:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:06.389 align:start position:0%
 
temporary

03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
03:01:09.990 --> 03:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
deserve neither and will receive
 
03:01:13.510 --> 03:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
neither liberty nor safety
 
03:01:18.950 --> 03:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:24.309 --> 03:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
general george washington was mentioned
 
03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
when he inoculated his troops he was
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
acting as a military officer the the the
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
highest military officer in the military
 
03:01:37.269 --> 03:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
people sacrifice their rights
 
03:01:37.279 --> 03:01:38.710 align:start position:0%
people sacrifice their rights
temporarily

03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
so that they may become a legitimate uh
 
03:01:44.550 --> 03:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
functioning engine that can protect
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
their nation so that their rights
 
03:01:49.510 --> 03:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
may be preserved
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
so that the rights of everybody else may
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
be preserved and so to compare his
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
inoculation of troops seems rather inept
 
03:02:00.150 --> 03:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:02:01.349 --> 03:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:02:04.389 --> 03:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh what are mandates well
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
mandates are either
 
03:02:09.190 --> 03:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
fascism or they are direct
 
03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:09.990 align:start position:0%
fascism or they are direct
uh

03:02:09.990 --> 03:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.349 align:start position:0%
uh
decrees

03:02:11.349 --> 03:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
decrees
 
03:02:14.309 --> 03:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
from someone who's put themselves up as
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a sat drought a kind of a a
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
regional dictator or perhaps they're the
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
president of the united states
 
03:02:26.309 --> 03:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
setting himself up in the same way
 
03:02:26.319 --> 03:02:27.429 align:start position:0%
setting himself up in the same way
or

03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
the mandates are being done through
 
03:02:31.349 --> 03:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
fascism if you look at a
 
03:02:34.070 --> 03:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
dictionary and you find a really good
 
03:02:36.630 --> 03:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
definition of fascism you'll find out
 
03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
that fascism
 
03:02:42.830 --> 03:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:45.750 --> 03:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
partnerships and in a public private
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
private partnership kind of atmosphere
 
03:02:52.389 --> 03:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
you can very easily use money in
 
03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
all kinds of a multitude of ways in
 
03:02:58.950 --> 03:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
order to have the money come down from
 
03:02:58.960 --> 03:02:59.990 align:start position:0%
order to have the money come down from
above

03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
above
 
03:03:01.429 --> 03:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
and to
 
03:03:01.439 --> 03:03:02.790 align:start position:0%
and to
uh

03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
have strings attached that are like
 
03:03:07.990 --> 03:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
gigantic steel cables
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
forcing the situation and that's exactly
 
03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
what we see happening now this is
 
03:03:16.950 --> 03:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
fascism and for people who think that
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
fascism is on the extreme right nothing
 
03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:21.429 align:start position:0%
fascism is on the extreme right nothing
doing

03:03:21.429 --> 03:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
the extreme left is government
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
controlling everybody the extreme right
 
03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
is is the those
 
03:03:30.150 --> 03:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
those people who think that there
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any kind of government at
 
03:03:32.399 --> 03:03:34.389 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any kind of government at
all

03:03:34.389 --> 03:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
so so fascism may be a few tiny degrees
 
03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the right or maybe to the left of
 
03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
communism but it certainly is not on the
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
right of the political spectrum
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
so here we see what's going on and it
 
03:03:56.389 --> 03:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:58.870 --> 03:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
you're going on 13 minutes
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay we see fraud taking place which is
 
03:04:05.910 --> 03:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
fraud and absolute absurdity an example
 
03:04:07.349 --> 03:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
of the fraud
 
03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
that fauci has committed
 
03:04:13.590 --> 03:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
is that he claimed
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
he claimed that rem deserver
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and this is
 
03:04:22.150 --> 03:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is ensconced
 
03:04:25.030 --> 03:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the very coveted protocol treatment
 
03:04:27.670 --> 03:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
that is still being used right now fauci
 
03:04:30.309 --> 03:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
is a fraud he claimed
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
that rem deserver was a highly
 
03:04:34.710 --> 03:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
successful treatment
 
03:04:37.349 --> 03:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
for ebola and therefore it should be
 
03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
used for coven 19 disease
 
03:04:43.190 --> 03:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
well the fact is that the study that he
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
based that on
 
03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
in that study
 
03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:48.469 align:start position:0%
in that study
51

03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
51
 
03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the people treated with rem deservier
 
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
died it was by far the largest
 
03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
percentage in that study of people who
 
03:04:57.520 --> 03:04:59.190 align:start position:0%
percentage in that study of people who
died

03:04:59.190 --> 03:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
died
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
and of course ebola is a strong disease
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
too and i take that into consideration
 
03:05:05.120 --> 03:05:06.710 align:start position:0%
too and i take that into consideration
but

03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:05:10.469 --> 03:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
fauci used that it's a direct flat out
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
blunt bald-faced lie that fauci
 
03:05:17.429 --> 03:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
told in his covid protocol and that
 
03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
protocol is the very one that is being
 
03:05:23.670 --> 03:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
used right now and it's being mandated
 
03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
so so we get it
 
03:05:27.510 --> 03:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
again back to the subject of mandates
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
what are mandates
 
03:05:32.070 --> 03:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
i have a sign that i made that says
 
03:05:35.349 --> 03:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
mandates are lawless decrees because
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what they are
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
they have no nothing constitutional
 
03:05:42.469 --> 03:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
behind them and in fact those who
 
03:05:42.479 --> 03:05:44.630 align:start position:0%
behind them and in fact those who
cooperate

03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
cooperate
 
03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
with this are violating the constitution
 
03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
the highest law of the land both of the
 
03:05:54.150 --> 03:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
us and new hampshire
 
03:05:55.990 --> 03:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that's about all i have to say for
 
03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
today thank you so much thank you people
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
for giving real time
 
03:06:03.460 --> 03:06:03.470 align:start position:0%
thank you god thank you
 
03:06:03.470 --> 03:06:04.790 align:start position:0%
thank you god thank you
[Applause]

03:06:04.790 --> 03:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:06:10.630 --> 03:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
next stop is kelly potanza potenza is
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:23.110 --> 03:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.110 --> 03:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
so i had the same question that he had
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
so about wednesday because
 
03:06:29.349 --> 03:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
i wanted to actually hear what everybody
 
03:06:32.469 --> 03:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
said first before i spoke
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm actually going to speak on
 
03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
wednesday but i just would like to say
 
03:06:39.910 --> 03:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
one thing here about house bill 220 and
 
03:06:41.590 --> 03:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
tim i know you know who i am because
 
03:06:44.790 --> 03:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
i've uh have many conversations with you
 
03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
about this
 
03:06:49.269 --> 03:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
so when house bill 220 was first you
 
03:06:51.269 --> 03:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
know originally initiated
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
it actually had protections right
 
03:06:53.520 --> 03:06:54.550 align:start position:0%
it actually had protections right
so

03:06:54.550 --> 03:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:56.870 --> 03:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know i just want to read it
 
03:06:58.870 --> 03:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
because this is what
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is where it should ended
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
every person
 
03:07:05.910 --> 03:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
has the natural essential and inherent
 
03:07:08.950 --> 03:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
right to bodily integrity free from any
 
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
threat or compulsion
 
03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
by government to accept an immunization
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
end of story
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
there should have been nothing else
 
03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
added to this
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
and instead we had legislatures
 
03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
that decided to take it on their own
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
to add conditions on there
 
03:07:26.960 --> 03:07:27.750 align:start position:0%
to add conditions on there
and

03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's so much that i can unpack just
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
with hp 220
 
03:07:34.230 --> 03:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
because it's very similar in a sense
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
to let's say the biden mandate
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
right so we have the buy to mandate
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
where everyone you know is gonna you
 
03:07:42.950 --> 03:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
know all these businesses over a hundred
 
03:07:44.469 --> 03:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
employees all of the stuff right they
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
have to all get an injection
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
except for the people that work in the
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
white house or the post office or
 
03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:50.830 align:start position:0%
white house or the post office or
whatever

03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:07:50.840 --> 03:07:52.710 align:start position:0%
whatever
in

03:07:52.710 --> 03:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
we did the same
 
03:07:57.670 --> 03:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
in a sense right because this didn't
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
protect any any private individual it
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
didn't protect my rights or my job or
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that didn't protect all of
 
03:08:05.269 --> 03:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
these healthcare workers that were
 
03:08:07.830 --> 03:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
heroes forever
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
until okay we have a mandate now
 
03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
but here in the state
 
03:08:13.830 --> 03:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
it protects everybody that's in this
 
03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
building working in here that gentleman
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
that dictator that's in the corner
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
office protects him protects all state
 
03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:20.950 align:start position:0%
office protects him protects all state
employees

03:08:20.950 --> 03:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:08:22.469 --> 03:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't protect any of these people that
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
are probably sitting here right now
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
and that's what
 
03:08:28.710 --> 03:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's why everything is is is all smoke
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
and mirrors
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
and that's been the problem all along
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
people were championing you along were
 
03:08:36.309 --> 03:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
championing this tim you were
 
03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
championing this and when you first put
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
this out it was fantastic but it got
 
03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
gutted in the senate
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
not by the democrats by the people that
 
03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
we had the majority
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
and everybody needs to know that the
 
03:08:49.590 --> 03:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
people that are supposed to be on the
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
side of freedom my freedoms to protect
 
03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
my freedoms right constitutional rights
 
03:08:57.429 --> 03:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
so i've got a lot more to say next time
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
around but i just wanted to uh uh i
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to thank
 
03:09:05.670 --> 03:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think we should have to
 
03:09:07.910 --> 03:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank we should be here all the time
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
speaking about this
 
03:09:11.269 --> 03:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
but to be honest none of this should be
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
even happening anyway you have zero
 
03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional authority at all based
 
03:09:17.429 --> 03:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
upon new hampshire constitution to tell
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
me what i can do or not do with my body
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
my body by my choice only applies to
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
killing babies
 
03:09:26.229 --> 03:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
give me a break i'm really done with all
 
03:09:28.550 --> 03:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
of this but thanks for being here and i
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%

thank you kelly

and no man has the power
 
03:11:09.990 --> 03:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
to tell just when the hands will stop at
 
03:11:12.150 --> 03:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
late or early hour
 
03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
to lose one's wealth is sad indeed
 
03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
to lose one's health is more
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
to lose one's soul is such a loss
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
that no one can restore
 
03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
our eternal souls are at stake

properly
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
labeling rooms so that we know how to
 
03:13:06.630 --> 03:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
clean them
 
03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
that we know
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
what ppe to put on to go in there to
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
keep ourselves safe
 
03:13:16.229 --> 03:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
every day every day i went to work i
 
03:13:19.030 --> 03:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
stepped in a room
 
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
that was a coven 19 positive case
 
03:13:27.190 --> 03:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
i have not gotten sick
 
03:13:31.349 --> 03:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
i have not
 
03:13:34.389 --> 03:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
taken i've not been tested
 
03:13:34.399 --> 03:13:35.429 align:start position:0%
taken i've not been tested
because

03:13:35.429 --> 03:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
in my religious belief
 
03:13:40.830 --> 03:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
i do not take unnecessary medical
 
03:13:40.840 --> 03:13:42.710 align:start position:0%
i do not take unnecessary medical
procedures

03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
03:13:45.590 --> 03:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
it is unnecessary for me to take
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:51.910 --> 03:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
i had to be out i chose to be out of
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
work for 10 days
 
03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
because i wouldn't be tested
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
that is the only time during this whole
 
03:13:57.840 --> 03:13:59.349 align:start position:0%
that is the only time during this whole
pandemic

03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
if that's what you want to call it that
 
03:14:04.790 --> 03:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:07.269 align:start position:0%
 
when

03:14:07.269 --> 03:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:09.510 --> 03:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
this vaccine came out
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
at first
 
03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:12.150 align:start position:0%
at first
it

03:14:12.150 --> 03:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:14:13.750 --> 03:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
you didn't have to get it they didn't
 
03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:17.110 align:start position:0%
you didn't have to get it they didn't
care

03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
but then they said everybody had to have
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
it but you can apply for a religious or
 
03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
medical exemption
 
03:14:27.030 --> 03:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i did i know my constitutional rights
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
and i was not going to
 
03:14:31.590 --> 03:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
fill out the outrageous
 
03:14:34.469 --> 03:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
forms that they put i was not going to
 
03:14:37.750 --> 03:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
agree to wear extra ppe that i had
 
03:14:40.950 --> 03:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
almost passed out from wearing cleaning
 
03:14:44.550 --> 03:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
so i was denied my religious exemption
 
03:14:49.990 --> 03:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
because i would not adhere
 
03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:51.190 align:start position:0%
because i would not adhere
to

03:14:51.190 --> 03:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:53.830 --> 03:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
their policy
 
03:14:57.510 --> 03:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
i resigned i wasn't fired i resigned
 
03:15:00.790 --> 03:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
because i was one of four people at this
 
03:15:00.800 --> 03:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
because i was one of four people at this
hospital

03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
that could properly clean coven 19 rooms
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
or the operating room
 
03:15:13.429 --> 03:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
i saw daily people who were vaccinated
 
03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
coming to work
 
03:15:14.960 --> 03:15:17.190 align:start position:0%
coming to work
sick

03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
sick
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
coughing fevers shaking no matter if
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
this covid thing wasn't even here those
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
people should not have been at work
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
i saw this with my own eyes
 
03:15:36.870 --> 03:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
i was there
 
03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:38.309 align:start position:0%
i was there
um

03:15:38.309 --> 03:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:41.910 --> 03:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
and that's my testimony personally
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
i also have a daughter
 
03:15:44.319 --> 03:15:45.269 align:start position:0%
i also have a daughter
who

03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:15:47.670 --> 03:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
is 13 that comes to a lot of events with
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
me so some of you might have seen her
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
she actually had a reaction to her mmr
 
03:15:55.279 --> 03:15:58.150 align:start position:0%
she actually had a reaction to her mmr
vaccine

03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:00.950 --> 03:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
i was told when she was i think she was
 
03:16:03.030 --> 03:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
five or six at the time
 
03:16:04.790 --> 03:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
i was told
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
when i called because my daughter was
 
03:16:07.520 --> 03:16:09.269 align:start position:0%
when i called because my daughter was
limp

03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
limp
 
03:16:09.279 --> 03:16:10.469 align:start position:0%
limp
fever

03:16:10.469 --> 03:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
fever
 
03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
so hot i could barely touch her i felt
 
03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
like my hands were gonna burn
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
i thought my daughter was going to die
 
03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
i was told by a nurse
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
at the hospital
 
03:16:27.190 --> 03:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
that i could bring her into the
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
emergency room
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
but there wasn't anything that they
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
could do
 
03:16:34.469 --> 03:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
so i decided to keep my daughter home
 
03:16:36.070 --> 03:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
because if she was going to die she was
 
03:16:41.190 --> 03:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:41.200 --> 03:16:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
record has not even been put in her
 
03:16:46.790 --> 03:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
medical records
 
03:16:49.750 --> 03:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital did not
 
03:16:51.910 --> 03:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
report that to theirs
 
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
or anywhere that she had that reaction
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
also with the same daughter
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:06.229 --> 03:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
so it is very hard for her to do things
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
she has been told and i have emails that
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
i can forward
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
but i don't have them on me because i
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
didn't know what i didn't even know that
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
she would not be able to participate in
 
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
gym class
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
if she did not wear a mask
 
03:17:32.229 --> 03:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
they would bench her from getting
 
03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
physical activity in school
 
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
because she has a hard time breathing
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
and doing physical activities with a
 
03:17:41.269 --> 03:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
mask on
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
this daughter because she wants to see
 
03:17:44.710 --> 03:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
her friends
 
03:17:47.670 --> 03:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
and be social with her friends
 
03:17:50.229 --> 03:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
puts a mask on her face when she goes to
 
03:17:50.239 --> 03:17:53.110 align:start position:0%
puts a mask on her face when she goes to
school

03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:55.349 --> 03:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
and when she comes home
 
03:17:57.750 --> 03:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
you can tell that she hasn't had the
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
she had
 
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
she has allergies
 
03:18:09.920 --> 03:18:10.160 align:start position:0%

when she's active which she only goes to
 
03:18:16.229 --> 03:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
school for two classes because we
 
03:18:19.269 --> 03:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:20.830 --> 03:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
her temperature
 
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
rises it's
 
03:18:25.349 --> 03:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's been told to me since she was
 
03:18:26.710 --> 03:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know three
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
um the doctors have written many school
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
nurses saying unless she has
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
a fever over 100.5 not to worry about it
 
03:18:38.710 --> 03:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
it's just how her body works
 
03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
she recently had to be pulled out of her
 
03:18:40.720 --> 03:18:42.950 align:start position:0%
she recently had to be pulled out of her
classes

03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
classes
 
03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
because she had a temperature of
 
03:18:45.359 --> 03:18:47.510 align:start position:0%
because she had a temperature of
99.6

03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
99.6
 
03:18:49.510 --> 03:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
after gym class
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
and because she has allergies
 
03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:53.030 align:start position:0%
and because she has allergies
and

03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:55.269 --> 03:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
was upset that she was put in
 
03:18:59.190 --> 03:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
an isolation room that's her words
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
an isolation room in the nurse's office
 
03:19:03.830 --> 03:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
she was having a panic attack because
 
03:19:07.269 --> 03:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:08.389 --> 03:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
all alone
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
when nobody else
 
03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
and nobody even called me
 
03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:17.429 --> 03:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
nobody told me that she was put in this
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
room they said she had a sniffle and a
 
03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
fever but nobody told me that
 
03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
she was isolated
 
03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
so she was out of school for 10 days and
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
none of those 10 days was she given any
 
03:19:32.710 --> 03:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
of her schoolwork how is that right
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
how is that okay
 
03:19:36.790 --> 03:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
for her to fall behind and have to make
 
03:19:38.550 --> 03:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
all that up
 
03:19:40.150 --> 03:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
because of something that most likely
 
03:19:43.510 --> 03:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
again we don't test
 
03:19:48.150 --> 03:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
so we're not sure but she wasn't sick
 
03:19:51.750 --> 03:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:54.710 --> 03:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
there is no exemptions nothing for
 
03:19:58.830 --> 03:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
children at school for sports
 
03:19:58.840 --> 03:20:00.469 align:start position:0%
children at school for sports
so

03:20:00.469 --> 03:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
she won't be able to play basketball
 
03:20:04.630 --> 03:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
again this year even though she wants to
 
03:20:04.640 --> 03:20:06.469 align:start position:0%
again this year even though she wants to
because

03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:20:08.309 --> 03:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's required to wear a mask inside but
 
03:20:11.190 --> 03:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
not outside and you can
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
basically kiss your friend outside
 
03:20:16.469 --> 03:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
but inside you have to socially distance
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
and have a mask on
 
03:20:22.530 --> 03:20:22.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:22.540 --> 03:20:23.910 align:start position:0%

03:20:26.309 --> 03:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
also i wanted to say that
 
03:20:29.590 --> 03:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
i did work at a hospital so there is
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines that we had to
 
03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:33.030 align:start position:0%
vaccines that we had to
have

03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:20:36.550 --> 03:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
immune to certain
 
03:20:41.190 --> 03:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
certain diseases
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
so when i started there
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
they couldn't find my hepatitis b
 
03:20:45.359 --> 03:20:47.190 align:start position:0%
they couldn't find my hepatitis b
vaccine

03:20:47.190 --> 03:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
so i had to have my titers
 
03:20:49.120 --> 03:20:51.190 align:start position:0%
so i had to have my titers
taken

03:20:51.190 --> 03:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
taken
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
even though i had had my hepatitis b
 
03:20:53.279 --> 03:20:55.110 align:start position:0%
even though i had had my hepatitis b
vaccine

03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not immune to hepatitis b
 
03:21:03.359 --> 03:21:04.309 align:start position:0%
i'm not immune to hepatitis b
so

03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
because they didn't protect me from
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
hepatitis b
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not immune to hepatitis b
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
so why why this whole push for vaccines
 
03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:20.070 align:start position:0%
so why why this whole push for vaccines
that

03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
aren't even going to work that
 
03:21:23.830 --> 03:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
that natural immunity is most likely
 
03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:27.510 align:start position:0%
that natural immunity is most likely
better

03:21:27.510 --> 03:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
and i'll close with this
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
because what's coming here
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%

maybe this might resonate
 
03:23:00.309 --> 03:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
so as a mother of four daughters
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
i trusted my pediatricians and nurses
 
03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
however when i questioned them the need
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
and the safety of the vaccines my babies

03:23:15.190 --> 03:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
they began to show me laminated pictures

i did what most mothers do
 
03:23:40.950 --> 03:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
which was to listen to the doctors
 
03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
and continue with the scheduled
 
03:23:43.279 --> 03:23:46.150 align:start position:0%

03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
and 19 screws
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
screwed to her spine
 
03:24:18.550 --> 03:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
after a painful bone graft from her hip
 
03:24:21.269 --> 03:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
to cover her spine
 
03:24:24.309 --> 03:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
for bone regrowth needed
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
to cover these rods
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
she underwent a nine hour surgery
 
03:24:31.590 --> 03:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
where she also needed a blood
 
03:24:34.389 --> 03:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
transfusion as well
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
all the specialists told me
 
03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
there were no reasons for scoliosis
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
no studies that can show why this
 
03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:48.630 align:start position:0%
no studies that can show why this
happens

03:24:48.630 --> 03:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
happens
 
03:24:50.710 --> 03:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
and they also said this wasn't proven to
 
03:24:52.150 --> 03:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
be genetic
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
which was very confusing because we
 
03:24:56.870 --> 03:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
didn't have this in either side
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
of her family
 
03:25:02.070 --> 03:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
yet for some reason three
 
03:25:04.389 --> 03:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
of my four daughters
 
03:25:08.150 --> 03:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
all suffer from scoliosis
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
so last year being homebound due to the
 
03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:12.870 align:start position:0%
so last year being homebound due to the
lockdown

03:25:12.870 --> 03:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
lockdown
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
i did some serious research
 
03:25:17.429 --> 03:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
and discovered
 
03:25:19.590 --> 03:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
the very few studies that have been done
 
03:25:21.670 --> 03:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
on scoliosis
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
but one study
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
related to this spine disease has
 
03:25:29.190 --> 03:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
similarities to polio
 
03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:30.710 align:start position:0%
similarities to polio
however

03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:25:32.790 --> 03:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
due to the lack of
 
03:25:32.800 --> 03:25:34.070 align:start position:0%
due to the lack of
funding

03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
as we heard this morning children have
 
03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
received 72 vaccines
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's a minimum
 
03:25:48.790 --> 03:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:52.229 --> 03:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
as a child i probably received five
 
03:25:54.630 --> 03:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
including polio
 
03:25:57.269 --> 03:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if any of these vaccines
 
03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
caused my daughter's scoliosis
 
03:26:02.309 --> 03:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
but there does seem to lie some
 
03:26:02.319 --> 03:26:05.670 align:start position:0%
but there does seem to lie some
suspicion

03:26:05.670 --> 03:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:08.070 --> 03:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
what happens to the people's bodies
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
through generational vaccines
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
do we know
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
are there any studies
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
i haven't found any
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
if we don't even know how the long-term
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
safety and effectiveness of our current
 
03:26:21.760 --> 03:26:23.590 align:start position:0%
safety and effectiveness of our current
immunizations

03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
03:26:25.349 --> 03:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
how can we continue
 
03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
to mandate any experimental
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
and approved vaccines
 
03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:37.190 --> 03:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you claudine
 
03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:40.790 align:start position:0%

how you doing i'm gonna be reading for
 
03:26:55.190 --> 03:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
my phone and i'd just like to make this
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
statement that
 
03:26:58.229 --> 03:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
the statement i'm making reflects only
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
my personal beliefs and it does not
 
03:27:03.429 --> 03:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
reflect that of my job currently
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
my name is shannon gardner and i live in

i've been a first responder all my life

and also live in a dual household the
 
03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:13.200 align:start position:0%

myself my boyfriend
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
pretty much my boyfriend and myself have
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
driven every emergency vehicle equipped
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
with red white and blue lights
 
03:27:24.309 --> 03:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
i serve several years in the military
 
03:27:26.469 --> 03:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
and i also come from a family of nursing

police and teachers
 
03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
all my life i have taken positions to
 
03:27:33.190 --> 03:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
defend the freedoms of others and will
 
03:27:35.750 --> 03:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
continue to do so today
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
the topic of patriotism was brought up
 
03:27:39.910 --> 03:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
before and i think the true definition
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
of patriotism is signing your life away
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
in a dotted line for your country and
 
03:27:46.150 --> 03:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
not taking a vaccine
 
03:27:47.590 --> 03:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
when i was younger
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
still in the military i was going to
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
thailand to teach english
 
03:27:53.030 --> 03:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i was told i needed a special
 
03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:55.030 align:start position:0%
and i was told i needed a special
vaccine

03:27:55.030 --> 03:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
i got the japanese encephalitis vaccine
 
03:27:59.670 --> 03:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
because i was told i had to get it or i
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't go
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
i agreed and got the shot
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
as i stood up to walk away after rolling
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
down my sleeve i was told to sit down
 
03:28:09.030 --> 03:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
and wait
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
when i asked why i couldn't leave
 
03:28:12.870 --> 03:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
i was told it was because the vaccine
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
was new and my branch for the military
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
still didn't know all the fold side
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
side effects so they would have to
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
monitor me for an additional 30 minutes
 
03:28:24.389 --> 03:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure i didn't have any immediate
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
side effects
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
now that i'm older
 
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
with additional education
 
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
additional life experience and also out
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the military
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be another test subject
 
03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
i also refuse to see my two step kids
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
two beautiful little girls
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
or any other child be the nation's
 
03:28:45.910 --> 03:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
guinea pig to an experimental vaccine or
 
03:28:47.750 --> 03:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
booster shot
 
03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
mandating vaccination for work or being
 
03:28:52.150 --> 03:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
forced to show proof of vaccination as
 
03:28:53.590 --> 03:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
medical tyranny
 
03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:29:01.590 --> 03:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:13.990 --> 03:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
03:29:16.870 --> 03:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
can i just get your last name
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
axelman a-x-e-l-m-a-m thank you my name
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
is elliot axelman i'm a critical care
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
and flight certified paramedic i've been
 
03:29:26.309 --> 03:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
in ems since 2011 so that's about 10
 
03:29:26.319 --> 03:29:27.429 align:start position:0%
in ems since 2011 so that's about 10
years

03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
overall the education for whoever cares
 
03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
about education it's for paramedic and
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
all the emt and all that stuff is about
 
03:29:35.429 --> 03:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
roughly the same as a pa a physician
 
03:29:37.349 --> 03:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
assistant so it's a few years
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
and uh like 600 hours of clinicals
 
03:29:41.429 --> 03:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
i've worked in i've worked in uh
 
03:29:43.990 --> 03:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
critical care transfers and 911 systems
 
03:29:44.950 --> 03:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
throughout new york and throughout new
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire now for the past few years
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
all of my experience and all the data
 
03:29:50.309 --> 03:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
that i've seen because i've researched
 
03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
covent i
 
03:29:53.670 --> 03:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
actually worked in a coveted hospital
 
03:29:56.150 --> 03:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
last year in may of 2020 i worked for a
 
03:29:57.510 --> 03:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
few weeks in atlanta in a hospital with
 
03:29:59.510 --> 03:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
just covet patients for overflow from
 
03:30:01.190 --> 03:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
grady hospital
 
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
all my experience with covet and the
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
data and research of the statistics
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
leads me to believe
 
03:30:07.750 --> 03:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the stats of
 
03:30:07.760 --> 03:30:08.790 align:start position:0%
that the stats of
cases

03:30:08.790 --> 03:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
cases
 
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
infectiousness lethality
 
03:30:12.790 --> 03:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
and uh just how dangerous it is in
 
03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
general have been exaggerated like
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in history of existence
 
03:30:17.990 --> 03:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
depending on exactly the figures looking
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
at it might have been exaggerated by a
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
hundred fold maybe a thousand fold maybe
 
03:30:23.190 --> 03:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
ten thousand fold
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
they inflated the statistics from the
 
03:30:27.429 --> 03:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
beginning in order to propagandize the
 
03:30:29.910 --> 03:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
entire pandemic as we know now and in
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
order to pass
 
03:30:31.120 --> 03:30:31.830 align:start position:0%
order to pass
the

03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:33.750 --> 03:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know millions of different forms of
 
03:30:35.269 --> 03:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
corona fascism including in new
 
03:30:36.870 --> 03:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire and throughout the world they
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
inflated statistics first by cycling the
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
pcr tests 40 45 times instead of 20 25
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
times which was the standard and that
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
might have caused i don't know 99.9
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
false positives maybe so right right
 
03:30:51.190 --> 03:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
there we have maybe an inflation of a
 
03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
million fold of statistics they also
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
bribed hospitals as we know now cms the
 
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
center for medicaid and medicare
 
03:30:58.469 --> 03:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
services the federal government that
 
03:31:00.389 --> 03:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
sets all the reimbursement rates and
 
03:31:01.990 --> 03:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
they pay almost every person is a
 
03:31:04.469 --> 03:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
medicaid or medicare payer maybe 70 80
 
03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
90 of patients in the united states have
 
03:31:08.309 --> 03:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid or medicare so they control the
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
rates as well and they have most
 
03:31:11.349 --> 03:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
patients they were reimbursing hospitals
 
03:31:13.269 --> 03:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
i think uh nine thousand or thirteen
 
03:31:15.030 --> 03:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per covenant admission
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
and thirty seven thousand dollars per
 
03:31:19.510 --> 03:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
ventilator use if you listed covid so
 
03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
again when you incentivize people with
 
03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
money they're more likely to do it it's
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
that also might have inflated statistics
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
by again who knows how much 10 50 100 a
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
thousand fold because they're giving
 
03:31:31.830 --> 03:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
them 37 thousand dollars per patient but
 
03:31:34.870 --> 03:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
it gets even crazier a lot crazier they
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
started saying we don't even need tests
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
anymore there's something called
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
pathonemonic in medicine pathomonic
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
means a symptom that is a rare symptom
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
and it's guaranteed 100 of certain
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
disease they made it seem like every
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
symptom from general symptoms like
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
weakness fever rapid heart rate slow
 
03:31:50.790 --> 03:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
heart rate rapid breathing slow
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
breathing uh tiredness nausea diarrhea
 
03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
very common symptoms that everyone has
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
from time to time they essentially said
 
03:31:59.429 --> 03:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
the cdc that all of those symptoms each
 
03:32:01.349 --> 03:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
of them is pathomonic for covid meaning
 
03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
if someone has weakness or a headache or
 
03:32:05.670 --> 03:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
a rapid heart rate we are 100 sure they
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
have covid you don't even have to test
 
03:32:09.510 --> 03:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
them why waste a test i'm 100 sure they
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
have coveted so if anyone in a hospital
 
03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
has a heart rate over 100 which i in my
 
03:32:15.750 --> 03:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
opinion maybe 99 of patients in the
 
03:32:17.349 --> 03:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
hospitals have a rapid heart rate at
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
some point we can say 100 it's 100 sure
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's covered let's let's covet again
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
that inflated statistics by
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
essentially calling everyone coveted so
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
right there we have
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
statistics that could essentially say
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
that every human in the hospital in the
 
03:32:33.190 --> 03:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
world has coveted because everyone in
 
03:32:34.309 --> 03:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
the hospital by definition has some
 
03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
symptom right that it's a place with
 
03:32:37.830 --> 03:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
sick people so right from the get-go the
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
statistics were off and again i trusted
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
medicine i'm a critical thinker as you
 
03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
guys know me but i also trusted medicine
 
03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
i trusted the cdc i trusted the fda a
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
lot more than the other folks in dc but
 
03:32:50.229 --> 03:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
over the past two years i've lost a lot
 
03:32:54.389 --> 03:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
of faith and the cdc fda fauci have lost
 
03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
my faith by doing things that were
 
03:32:55.600 --> 03:32:57.030 align:start position:0%
my faith by doing things that were
anti-scientific

03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
anti-scientific
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
from a year or two ago when they start
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
started denying for the first time in
 
03:33:03.190 --> 03:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
history that natural immunity from prior
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
infection existed when i heard fauci
 
03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
tell rand paul and house and senate
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
repeatedly natural immunity that's not
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
worth nothing you need the vaccine and i
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
said you know it's got to be worth
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
something if you have the infection you
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
have antibodies do it that's how every
 
03:33:18.070 --> 03:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
virus and bacteria in the universe you
 
03:33:20.229 --> 03:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
know that's how it works i believe so
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
right away i knew
 
03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.790 --> 03:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
so let's stick to the policy let's try
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
not to assign assign blame
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
right overall with vaccines i thought
 
03:33:33.190 --> 03:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
this was about what is considered a
 
03:33:34.630 --> 03:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
medical intervention i would consider a
 
03:33:36.309 --> 03:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
vaccine a medical intervention i don't
 
03:33:38.309 --> 03:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of debate about that
 
03:33:39.510 --> 03:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's important for everyone to
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
remember again me as a medical provider
 
03:33:42.870 --> 03:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
who does things to patients very similar
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
to what an er doctor might do as far as
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
emergency care we deliver medications
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
and advanced airways and we run codes
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
and all that every time i do an
 
03:33:51.990 --> 03:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
intervention for a patient whether it's
 
03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
starting an iv and giving them fluid or
 
03:33:56.309 --> 03:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
medication or defibrillating them or
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
intubating them with the tube and
 
03:33:59.030 --> 03:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
putting them on a ventilator before i do
 
03:34:00.550 --> 03:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
every single thing
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
i subconsciously or consciously
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
calculate the risk and reward and just
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
two things there's what is the what is
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
the risk percentage and how profound is
 
03:34:10.630 --> 03:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
that risk is it a 80 risk and is the
 
03:34:12.950 --> 03:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
risk very profound is it death or is it
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
a low risk and a low amount of you know
 
03:34:17.830 --> 03:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
not a very bad side effect and the same
 
03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
with the benefit what's the chance of
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
benefit if i give an asthmatic albuterol
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
the benefit might be 80 and the benefit
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
is tremendous benefit because it can
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
help them with these vaccines and the
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
big takeaway is
 
03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
overall what's the benefit of the
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine that depends on how bad covet is
 
03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
again at all my experience it's not a
 
03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic there are millions of reasons
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
why the overall death rate if you look
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
at mortality has not gone up it's steady
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
2018 2019 20 20 21 there's no
 
03:34:45.030 --> 03:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
significant increase meaning people who
 
03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
may have died of flu or other causes as
 
03:34:48.550 --> 03:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned they were 80 years old
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
meaning they were technically speaking
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the most likely to die and the
 
03:34:54.150 --> 03:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
insult would have killed them it could
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
have been a flu or a trip and fall which
 
03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
we see a lot with elderly or coronavirus
 
03:34:59.830 --> 03:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
so if the overall excess mortality rate
 
03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
is not going up then by definition it's
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a pandemic
 
03:35:05.510 --> 03:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
overall what's the benefit of the
 
03:35:07.349 --> 03:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine again we have a lot of people
 
03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the united states believing
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
what they see on tv and from dc
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
politicians saying everyone has to get
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
the vaccine that's going to save you
 
03:35:15.349 --> 03:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
even though at the same time they're
 
03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
saying it's you could still get it and
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
you can still transmit it even with the
 
03:35:18.960 --> 03:35:20.630 align:start position:0%
you can still transmit it even with the
vaccine

03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
the benefit is directly proportional is
 
03:35:25.269 --> 03:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
related to how bad covet is for instance
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
me i'm 28 i'm in excellent shape i'm a
 
03:35:29.429 --> 03:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
boxer runner power lifter a personal
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
trainer so i'm a decent shape the risk
 
03:35:32.710 --> 03:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
of me getting covered and dying from it
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
is very very small i don't know maybe
 
03:35:36.309 --> 03:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
one in a million one in a billion so
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's that risk now let's compare it to
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of the vaccine i don't know
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
what it is but maybe not one in a
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
million maybe one in a thousand of
 
03:35:42.319 --> 03:35:43.670 align:start position:0%
million maybe one in a thousand of
myocarditis

03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
myocarditis
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
kind of small but kind of big a lot
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
bigger than covet what's the risk of
 
03:35:48.950 --> 03:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
infertility i'm still trying to have my
 
03:35:50.950 --> 03:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
first baby my wife and i we're getting
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
up there in age we're
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
just about 30 and if we are trying to
 
03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
have a baby and there's fertility issues
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
with which a lot of people have
 
03:36:00.870 --> 03:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned for a man and female there's
 
03:36:02.070 --> 03:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
fertility issues for both with the
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine we don't know that yet because
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been studied for that long the
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
one attending physician in the er i go
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
to said she's not sure but she waited
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
until she was totally done having kids
 
03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
and totally done nursing kids before
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
getting the vaccine so we just don't
 
03:36:14.560 --> 03:36:15.510 align:start position:0%
getting the vaccine so we just don't
know

03:36:15.510 --> 03:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:36:17.670 --> 03:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
when faushi and the dc politicians
 
03:36:19.510 --> 03:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
started saying we believe pregnant women
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
should get it based on this and this is
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
a quote he said we see no reason why it
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
would have a negative effect on
 
03:36:26.950 --> 03:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so just get it
 
03:36:28.389 --> 03:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's not again that's not science
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's not really how it works
 
03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's a few more thoughts here
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
even if this were the approaching ten
 
03:36:36.630 --> 03:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
minutes just to let you know oh wow
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
sorry i'll speed up even if this were
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the worst pandemic in history like the
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
bubonic plague multiplied by the spanish
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
flu and it were killing seven billion
 
03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
people in the world and we mentioned the
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
stats here like two people under 30 have
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
died in new hampshire a total of a
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
thousand or 1500 have died even if it
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
were killing billions of people a day i
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
still as a voluntarist i would not
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
support any government mandate good
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
ideas don't require force if it were
 
03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
killing billions of people would it be
 
03:37:01.590 --> 03:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
if everyone in the world died and i were
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
the last person still i wouldn't support
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
on principle a government mandating what
 
03:37:07.269 --> 03:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
you put in your body once the government
 
03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
can mandate what you put in your body
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
you have no freedom left and as liver
 
03:37:12.389 --> 03:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
disease state then there's no point in
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
really living anymore if you can't be
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
free i went over the very statistics and
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
others have gone over that a lot so you
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
don't even have to
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
and the of course the hygiene hypothesis
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
the whole hypothesis of the more you're
 
03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
exposed to things it could be good we
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
have tons of doctors on record
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
pediatricians saying maybe we're using
 
03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
too much bacterial soap and sanitizer
 
03:37:31.349 --> 03:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
maybe kids should actually be more
 
03:37:33.190 --> 03:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
exposed to these things and again
 
03:37:35.349 --> 03:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
speaking of kids they are less
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh vulnerable to kovid than they are the
 
03:37:38.550 --> 03:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
flu i wrote a whole book about this so i
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
went over the stats the flu kills more
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
than covet so kids are more likely to
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
get the flu and spread the flu and die
 
03:37:45.269 --> 03:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
of the flu than covet they're a little
 
03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
more safe with kovid now that kovat
 
03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
boxed out the flu kids are literally
 
03:37:49.830 --> 03:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
safer now than they were two years ago
 
03:37:51.349 --> 03:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
so we should not be masking kids and
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
abusing kids by making them depressed
 
03:37:55.269 --> 03:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
and suicidal and on drugs and
 
03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
not be able to see their friends and not
 
03:37:58.150 --> 03:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
develop mentally because they can't see
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
their faces we should take the masks off
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
masks literally scientifically there's
 
03:38:04.150 --> 03:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
more reason for to mask kids with flu
 
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
in conclusion because pretty much all
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
corona fascism has arisen from the
 
03:38:12.870 --> 03:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
government and what the government can't
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
do and i think a lot of people know this
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
now the government can't mandate every
 
03:38:17.590 --> 03:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
single person get a vaccine so they
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
deputize private companies to do their
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
dirty work which is disgusting and i
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
think people are catching on people are
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
smarter than politicians giving credit
 
03:38:24.239 --> 03:38:25.030 align:start position:0%
smarter than politicians giving credit
for

03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
my company for instance is has been
 
03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
deputized either
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
on purpose or or you know subconsciously
 
03:38:33.670 --> 03:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
deputized by the government to implement
 
03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
these mandates and then the government
 
03:38:36.550 --> 03:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
can say it's not them in fact the
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
government could say we don't want to
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
get involved in private business again
 
03:38:41.429 --> 03:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
we've spoken to sununu about this and
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
they have been involved in private
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
business private businesses in new
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire especially health like i work
 
03:38:45.439 --> 03:38:46.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire especially health like i work
in

03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
have to obey millions of laws i know
 
03:38:49.189 --> 03:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
there are a total of millions of
 
03:38:50.950 --> 03:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
regulations so they are already
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
essentially part of the government so
 
03:38:54.630 --> 03:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
the government can and should protect us
 
03:38:55.990 --> 03:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
from the coronal fascism from the
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
mandates and again someone mentioned the
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
exemption forms and i will i recall i'll
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
be emailing you a bunch of exception
 
03:39:02.070 --> 03:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
forms my company and a lot of other
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
companies it is four pages for religious
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
or medical they want you to prove that
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
your religion is legitimate who's to say
 
03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
that first amendment anyone prove it's
 
03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
legitimate and prove that you are a
 
03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
pious believer in religion and it's
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
really rigorous and the medical one that
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
i asked for is four pages they say have
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
you ever gotten a vaccine before what
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
was it why did you get it tell me
 
03:39:21.189 --> 03:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
everything about the vaccine why did you
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
get that but you don't want to get this
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
one and it's four pages of tremendously
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
unethical private hipaa violating
 
03:39:28.229 --> 03:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
medical history that's extremely
 
03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
inappropriate i'm sure it's illegal
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
under numerous federal and state laws so
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
we'll look into that and you know
 
03:39:36.309 --> 03:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
ridiculous medical exemption forms so so
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're that government new
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the feds are utilizing
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
private businesses they're deputizing
 
03:39:43.349 --> 03:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
them to do your dirty work it's pretty
 
03:39:43.359 --> 03:39:44.550 align:start position:0%
them to do your dirty work it's pretty
disgusting

03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
disgusting
 
03:39:45.670 --> 03:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
in conclusion because pretty much
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
everything is coming from the feds
 
03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:47.910 align:start position:0%
everything is coming from the feds
either

03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
um directly or indirectly via federal
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
money the grants the coercion the
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
propaganda we see the tremendous biggest
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
propaganda campaign in history of
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
existence i'm asking every state
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
representative to support full-on
 
03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
independence from the union that is the
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
only thing we can do to get away from
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
poutine biden we can't ask them nice
 
03:40:02.870 --> 03:40:02.880 align:start position:0%

03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
i graduated from new hampshire hospital
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
school of nursing in
 
03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:46.389 align:start position:0%
school of nursing in
1974.

03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
1974.
 
03:40:46.399 --> 03:40:48.070 align:start position:0%
1974.
um

03:40:48.070 --> 03:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:49.590 --> 03:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of points to make that
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
are different
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
is that better okay
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
this is all in mandates um
 
03:41:01.189 --> 03:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
the mandates were originally predicated
 
03:41:03.269 --> 03:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
under the thought
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
that those who were not vaccinated
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
were more likely to spread the vaccine
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:13.269 align:start position:0%
the the
covet

03:41:13.269 --> 03:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
covet
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
which of course wasn't true but anyway
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's what they said
 
03:41:19.590 --> 03:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
the cdc said that so it must be right
 
03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:20.630 align:start position:0%
the cdc said that so it must be right
um

03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:20.640 --> 03:41:21.910 align:start position:0%
um
but

03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:41:21.920 --> 03:41:22.790 align:start position:0%
but
uh

03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody really believed
 
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the nih website
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
they say that the covet germ
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
or virus
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
lives on a hard surface for up to three
 
03:41:35.920 --> 03:41:37.269 align:start position:0%
lives on a hard surface for up to three
hours

03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
hours
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
that means
 
03:41:38.479 --> 03:41:39.750 align:start position:0%
that means
anybody

03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
can spread the virus whether they're
 
03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or whether they're not
 
03:41:44.720 --> 03:41:45.990 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or whether they're not
vaccinated

03:41:45.990 --> 03:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
the cdc stuck to that until july 27 of
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
this year
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
on their website
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you go look at the cdc.gov website
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
they had
 
03:42:00.550 --> 03:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
information that they put out on the
 
03:42:00.560 --> 03:42:01.990 align:start position:0%
information that they put out on the
27th

03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
27th
 
03:42:04.070 --> 03:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
which stated
 
03:42:06.790 --> 03:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
and they were only talking about the
 
03:42:06.800 --> 03:42:08.830 align:start position:0%
and they were only talking about the
variants

03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
variants
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
but it really clearly applies to any
 
03:42:12.399 --> 03:42:14.389 align:start position:0%
but it really clearly applies to any
virus

03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
virus
 
03:42:14.399 --> 03:42:15.510 align:start position:0%
virus
that

03:42:15.510 --> 03:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:18.550 --> 03:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
a vaccinated person can
 
03:42:18.560 --> 03:42:20.630 align:start position:0%
a vaccinated person can
spread

03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
spread
 
03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
the covert virus
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
now that was a break from their previous
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
statements this was on the 27th
 
03:42:31.590 --> 03:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
as well as people were not vaccinated
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
the only caveat they had
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
was to say they
 
03:42:37.359 --> 03:42:38.950 align:start position:0%
was to say they
think

03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:42:42.150 --> 03:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
they can't do it as long
 
03:42:42.160 --> 03:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
they can't do it as long
perhaps

03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
03:42:44.160 --> 03:42:45.429 align:start position:0%
perhaps
but

03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:42:47.670 --> 03:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
if it's three hours it's three hours and
 
03:42:47.680 --> 03:42:49.030 align:start position:0%
if it's three hours it's three hours and
a

03:42:49.030 --> 03:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:42:51.429 --> 03:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
person who has not been vaccinated would
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
be four hours well that's
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense
 
03:42:56.080 --> 03:42:57.590 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense
so

03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
employers have gone to the point of
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
instead of saying oh well let's see the
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated they say well the young
 
03:43:09.030 --> 03:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine are more likely to be sick so
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
we'll just get rid of them
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's the latest thing oh they're
 
03:43:14.710 --> 03:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're more sick well the fact is that
 
03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
now as we all know
 
03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
the vaccinator getting very sick with
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
the variants
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
i have a person very close to me
 
03:43:29.189 --> 03:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:29.199 --> 03:43:30.389 align:start position:0%
 
got

03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
got
 
03:43:30.399 --> 03:43:31.590 align:start position:0%
got
coveted

03:43:31.590 --> 03:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
coveted
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
she was fully vaccinated
 
03:43:37.750 --> 03:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
she went home to her husband
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
who was fully vaccinated
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
they were both very sick
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
neither one could go to bed they had to
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
sit up in bed or they had to lie on
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
their stomach to breathe they had a 12
 
03:43:51.750 --> 03:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
year old daughter who got
 
03:43:53.830 --> 03:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
a little sniffle
 
03:43:56.550 --> 03:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
and we know that's the way it works
 
03:43:58.150 --> 03:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
so the fact is
 
03:44:00.790 --> 03:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's fraudulent and we know it's
 
03:44:04.389 --> 03:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
fraudulent so what should be done
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
is that people who have been fired
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
because of this should be given their
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
jobs back
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
and they should be given back pay
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know there's any law that they
 
03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
care can take care of that but the fact
 
03:44:19.590 --> 03:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
is this is what should happen this is
 
03:44:22.469 --> 03:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
fraudulent it's totally political has
 
03:44:26.790 --> 03:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
the next point
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to talk about
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
is autopsies
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
now unfortunately and i don't know the
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
reason i've heard
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh ideas
 
03:44:39.760 --> 03:44:40.790 align:start position:0%
uh ideas
why

03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the united states they just basically
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't allow autopsies on people who have
 
03:44:46.080 --> 03:44:48.950 align:start position:0%
don't allow autopsies on people who have
coded

03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
i could be wrong but it's very difficult
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
to find information on that however
 
03:44:56.150 --> 03:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
in other countries it's very simple in
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
fact in canada
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
they have some really good studies on
 
03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:01.590 align:start position:0%
they have some really good studies on
autopsies

03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
autopsies
 
03:45:03.590 --> 03:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
by the way i have links for all this
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
i've sent emails to all five of you
 
03:45:08.590 --> 03:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
before i came here just in case
 
03:45:08.600 --> 03:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
before i came here just in case
[Music]

03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't have a printer so i could send
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
you some emails so it's there all of the
 
03:45:15.990 --> 03:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
links to all of these things are there
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
don't believe me don't whatever you do
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
don't believe me do your own research
 
03:45:23.349 --> 03:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
check it out make sure that there's a
 
03:45:25.110 --> 03:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff on the internet that
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
make sure you check out those those
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
links to find the actual truth
 
03:45:32.800 --> 03:45:33.910 align:start position:0%
links to find the actual truth
so

03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
in canada they researched the autopsies
 
03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
they found
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
unlike what was originally thought
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
was that that little jab stayed in your
 
03:45:46.630 --> 03:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
arm and didn't go anywhere else
 
03:45:49.750 --> 03:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then these protein spikes
 
03:45:51.670 --> 03:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
would create you know
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
your antibodies and they wouldn't go
 
03:45:53.520 --> 03:45:55.189 align:start position:0%
your antibodies and they wouldn't go
anywhere

03:45:55.189 --> 03:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
03:45:55.199 --> 03:45:56.710 align:start position:0%
anywhere
well

03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
in autopsy they have found that these
 
03:46:03.510 --> 03:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
protein spikes go throughout the entire
 
03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
body and bloodstream and even pass
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
through the blood brain barrier
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
so what that means is you have little
 
03:46:13.269 --> 03:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
coveted spikes in your brain
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
in your ovaries
 
03:46:17.429 --> 03:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
in your liver in your kidneys
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera et cetera
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
well some of the other people have
 
03:46:26.710 --> 03:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they know
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
women who stopped ovulating after they
 
03:46:31.349 --> 03:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
had this well
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
can we prove it no because they're not
 
03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
going to do a study on it because they
 
03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
don't want us to know that
 
03:46:39.199 --> 03:46:40.150 align:start position:0%
don't want us to know that
so

03:46:40.150 --> 03:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:42.630 --> 03:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
think about this we're talking about
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinating kids now
 
03:46:48.550 --> 03:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
do you really want your five or
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
six-year-old daughter
 
03:46:54.790 --> 03:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
to have that covet spike in her ovary
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
do you want grandchildren
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
do you not care oh it's better if she
 
03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
lives it doesn't have children well
 
03:47:02.469 --> 03:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
let's think about this
 
03:47:05.910 --> 03:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to ourselves we don't
 
03:47:05.920 --> 03:47:07.189 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to ourselves we don't
know

03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:47:09.510 --> 03:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
we won't know for 10 years
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
because it's going to take that long for
 
03:47:13.110 --> 03:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
us to figure out what's happening to
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
these kids we know it's happening in
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
adults we know their ovaries are
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
stopping to work sometimes they start up
 
03:47:18.960 --> 03:47:21.189 align:start position:0%
stopping to work sometimes they start up
again

03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
again there's not a lot of studies i
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
just know people who say this is what
 
03:47:27.429 --> 03:47:27.439 align:start position:0%
happened like the people who previously
 
03:47:27.439 --> 03:47:30.070 align:start position:0%
happened like the people who previously
testified

03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:30.080 --> 03:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:47:33.990 --> 03:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
how can we possibly consider
 
03:47:37.040 --> 03:47:38.469 align:start position:0%
how can we possibly consider
knowing

03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
like everyone else testified
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
that these children aren't going to get
 
03:47:44.469 --> 03:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
sick anyway
 
03:47:44.479 --> 03:47:45.349 align:start position:0%
sick anyway
but

03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll just sterilize them
 
03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
03:47:50.790 --> 03:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have their kidneys shut down
 
03:47:52.150 --> 03:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
we know
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
we know for a fact that there are a lot
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
of younger people
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
getting myocarditis and pericarditis
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
just like the doctor testified earlier
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
we know that's happening and that's
 
03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
because those proteins are going to the
 
03:48:07.199 --> 03:48:08.309 align:start position:0%
because those proteins are going to the
heart

03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
heart
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
and the pericardium sac around the heart
 
03:48:12.800 --> 03:48:14.870 align:start position:0%
and the pericardium sac around the heart
so

03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
why and why especially for young kids
 
03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:20.070 align:start position:0%
why and why especially for young kids
yeah

03:48:20.070 --> 03:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
i'm old i'm 70 years old so what i got
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:48:25.990 --> 03:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's probably better because covert
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
would kill me except i think i already
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
got it so
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's another story
 
03:48:30.560 --> 03:48:32.630 align:start position:0%
that's another story
so

03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
in summary two minute warning
 
03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
in summary two minute warning
yeah

03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
i guess i can kind of cut it out there
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
because you've heard enough statistics
 
03:48:45.910 --> 03:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
on who's dying and there's been a lot of
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
12 to 17 year olds who've been
 
03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
significantly significantly affected and
 
03:48:52.630 --> 03:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's in the statistics so i don't need
 
03:48:54.150 --> 03:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
to tell you about that i sent that to
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
you in an email
 
03:48:57.429 --> 03:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
so i'll cut out now so someone else can
 
03:48:59.189 --> 03:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
frank staples
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%

even though my bail conditions say i
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
have to stay a thousand feet from the
 
03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive council when
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
i came in here that officer said
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to be here are you
 
03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
i said is the governor here hold on this
 
03:49:34.150 --> 03:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
is all tied in and you will hear don't

frank
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking now you're you're you're
 
03:49:47.429 --> 03:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
wasting my time
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
so stop frank i'm not wasting your time
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
but you are sir so i'm gonna continue on
 
03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
with my first amendment rights
 
03:49:56.800 --> 03:49:57.590 align:start position:0%
with my first amendment rights
so

03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
i've exercised my first amendment rights
 
03:50:01.590 --> 03:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
since day one
 
03:50:06.229 --> 03:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
of the lockdowns i've been arrested five
 
03:50:06.239 --> 03:50:07.429 align:start position:0%
of the lockdowns i've been arrested five
times

03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i've been ticketed twice for my
 
03:50:09.840 --> 03:50:10.950 align:start position:0%
and i've been ticketed twice for my
speech

03:50:10.950 --> 03:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
speech
 
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i will not stop and you cannot stop
 
03:50:13.680 --> 03:50:14.469 align:start position:0%
and i will not stop and you cannot stop
me

03:50:14.469 --> 03:50:14.479 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:50:14.479 --> 03:50:17.910 align:start position:0%
me
okay

03:50:17.910 --> 03:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.920 --> 03:50:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:20.469 --> 03:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
this officer said you're not supposed to
 
03:50:23.110 --> 03:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
be here and the governor is not here so
 
03:50:25.030 --> 03:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
he said you're fine the governor's not
 
03:50:25.040 --> 03:50:25.990 align:start position:0%
he said you're fine the governor's not
here

03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:50:27.670 --> 03:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
now the governor's supposedly coming
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
back and that officer is out there going
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
to bat for me saying that i shouldn't be
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
arrested if he does come back and if he
 
03:50:36.630 --> 03:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
does come back it's entrapment at this
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
point and i'm not worried about it i
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
will fight it in court and i will win
 
03:50:42.479 --> 03:50:45.670 align:start position:0%
will fight it in court and i will win
so

03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:47.910 --> 03:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
we also need to have a second shift
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
meeting or hearing here
 
03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
for the first shift workers
 
03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
and or
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
another one on the weekends to allow the
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
people who i'm here to represent
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
to speak their first amendment
 
03:51:07.269 --> 03:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:09.269 --> 03:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
if you don't know your rights you don't
 
03:51:10.710 --> 03:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
have any thank you
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
hey i am speaking and i'm the chairman
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%

frank
 
03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
my comment
 
03:51:28.630 --> 03:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
my comment is that people online can't
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
hear you because you're screaming in the
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
mic if you want to be heard put the mic
 
03:51:34.630 --> 03:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
back on the stand
 
03:51:37.510 --> 03:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
slow down stop slowly interrupting me
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
and get impressive with me because i
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
have ptsd and head trauma and when you
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
get aggressive with me i get aggressive
 
03:51:46.389 --> 03:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
and i cannot control the volume of my
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
voice i am disabled
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
i cannot control the volume my voice
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
when i get excited and you are exciting

how do you know that i know my rights
 
03:52:34.870 --> 03:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
because i successfully prosecuted this
 
03:52:34.880 --> 03:52:36.309 align:start position:0%
because i successfully prosecuted this

and now you
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
guys want to experiment on prisoners
 
03:52:47.429 --> 03:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
with this vaccine
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
because it is an experiment
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'll read this from fda.gov
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
overall risk benefit conclusions
 
03:52:59.349 --> 03:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
let's see here
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
the number of participants
 
03:53:02.239 --> 03:53:03.429 align:start position:0%
the number of participants
in

03:53:03.429 --> 03:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
the current clinical development program
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%

anyone who gets this shot i have friends
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
who've gotten it and signed the uh
 
03:53:39.359 --> 03:53:40.790 align:start position:0%
who've gotten it and signed the uh
waiver

03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
if you've read the waiver you will know
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
that you are entering into an experiment
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
and this is 100 against nuremberg code
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
and against the constitution's state and
 
03:53:52.080 --> 03:53:54.070 align:start position:0%

getting loud and people again are it's
 
03:53:59.269 --> 03:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
breaking up online so people i don't
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
care about the people online they can
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
come here and speak with their feet like
 
03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
i am like i said i can't control the
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
volume of my voice when i get excited i
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
am pissed off and this all ends when
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
everybody else gets as pissed off
 
03:54:12.720 --> 03:54:13.670 align:start position:0%
everybody else gets as pissed off
any

03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
end of story i don't care about the
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:24.560 --> 03:54:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
stop

03:54:26.630 --> 03:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
stop
 
03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
you're making me lose my train of
 
03:54:28.399 --> 03:54:35.349 align:start position:0%
you're making me lose my train of
thought

03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:38.469 --> 03:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's answer since day one
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
has been the vaccine the vaccine the
 
03:54:41.840 --> 03:54:43.110 align:start position:0%
has been the vaccine the vaccine the
vaccine

03:54:43.110 --> 03:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
but the vaccine as we've heard does not
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
stop the spread
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
but the unvaccinated people that are at
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
work that won't get it have to get
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
testing why aren't we testing the
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinated people as well they should be
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
tested if anybody is getting tested
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
because they'd be the asymptomatic
 
03:55:00.720 --> 03:55:03.269 align:start position:0%
because they'd be the asymptomatic
spreaders

03:55:03.269 --> 03:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
spreaders
 
03:55:05.349 --> 03:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:55:08.070 --> 03:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah experimenting on prisoners you
 
03:55:10.229 --> 03:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
guys now want to experiment on prisoners
 
03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
with this house bill 220 the department
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
of corrections may mandate medical
 
03:55:16.710 --> 03:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
treatment or immunization for inmates
 
03:55:18.870 --> 03:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
when a direct threat exists what direct
 
03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:19.830 align:start position:0%
when a direct threat exists what direct
threat

03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
threat
 
03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
i'm supposed to have been dead 10 times
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
over by attending all these rallies and
 
03:55:25.510 --> 03:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
hugging people
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's all
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
bogus and you guys know it it's all
 
03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
about money have you received pfizer
 
03:55:34.229 --> 03:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
donations or any other donations from
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
any of these uh vaccine companies
 
03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
because the governor has
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
have you
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
have you
 
03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
have you
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
the nazis
 
03:55:53.830 --> 03:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
called the jews unclean
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
and dirty
 
03:55:57.510 --> 03:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
and they put them in camps
 
03:56:00.150 --> 03:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
and experimented on them too
 
03:56:02.469 --> 03:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
just like that 27 million in funding was
 
03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
going to go to putting me and others
 
03:56:06.150 --> 03:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
like me
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
in fema camps isolation and quarantine
 
03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
upon the orders of the federal
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
government and you're telling me that
 
03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
isn't strings attached and that's not
 
03:56:18.150 --> 03:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
abrogating our state constitutional
 
03:56:18.160 --> 03:56:19.189 align:start position:0%
abrogating our state constitutional
rights

03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:56:28.389 --> 03:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:30.389 --> 03:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
and here's a simile for you
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
everybody talks about spreading kovitz
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
spreading kovid's spreading cobit
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.960 --> 03:56:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
covid

03:56:39.990 --> 03:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
covid
 
03:56:42.309 --> 03:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
is a subset of symptoms
 
03:56:43.830 --> 03:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
like aids
 
03:56:46.150 --> 03:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
aids cannot be spread
 
03:56:48.469 --> 03:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
hiv is to aids
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
as sars
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
cov2 is to coven so if we're trying to
 
03:56:56.150 --> 03:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
stop anything we should be trying to
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
stop the spread of the virus sars cov2
 
03:57:01.990 --> 03:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
which is what a coronavirus
 
03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
what is a coronavirus
 
03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
a common cold
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's a common
 
03:57:11.990 --> 03:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
cold and why is it novel what does novel
 
03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
cold and why is it novel what does novel
mean

03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
novel is something new
 
03:57:18.309 --> 03:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
whenever a virus mutates it becomes a
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
novel one so every year every flu virus
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
is novel every new coronavirus is novel
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's nothing new and it's not novel it's
 
03:57:27.920 --> 03:57:28.790 align:start position:0%
it's nothing new and it's not novel it's
just

03:57:28.790 --> 03:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
to say it's just the the next the next
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh evolution
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
of this virus which is completely
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
natural and the only way we're going to
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
get hurt immunity is if we let all these
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
kids and all these healthy adults catch
 
03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
the thing and then build up their own
 
03:57:48.150 --> 03:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
natural immunity so like i said there's
 
03:57:50.870 --> 03:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
a strong chance that i'll be arrested
 
03:57:53.189 --> 03:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
when i leave here for exercising my
 
03:57:54.870 --> 03:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights but do you think
 
03:57:57.269 --> 03:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
i give one f
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
no i don't
 
03:58:01.510 --> 03:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
because it's my right to be here and
 
03:58:01.520 --> 03:58:03.429 align:start position:0%
because it's my right to be here and
speak

03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
and i'll pay the forty dollar bail
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
and i'll get out in maybe an hour or two
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal and i will be back
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
and everybody else that was arrested at
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
the executive council meeting the other
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
eight people
 
03:58:20.790 --> 03:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
do you know a nurse was arrested for
 
03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
saying amen and then three or four other

03:58:32.550 --> 03:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
why was that
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
why were people singled out for
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
exercising our first amendment which you
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%

03:58:55.990 --> 03:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
here i am today exercising my first
 
03:58:58.150 --> 03:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
amendment rights like i have been
 
03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
getting arrested for throughout the
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
entire pandemic peacefully
 
03:59:05.670 --> 03:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
and there's no threats that have been
 
03:59:07.990 --> 03:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
made what happened to the
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
the ag's alleged investigation into
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
threats made because we know where you
 
03:59:14.160 --> 03:59:15.110 align:start position:0%
threats made because we know where you
live

03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
live
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
why do we know where you live
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
because it's public record
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
we the people are to hold you the
 
03:59:24.870 --> 03:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
government our public servants

that's our job
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
your job is to abide by the oath that
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
you took and the story and if you take
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
away our first amendment rights that's
 
03:59:42.150 --> 03:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
right the second is going to come out
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's the only one that's going to be
 
03:59:45.510 --> 03:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
left you're drifting away from policy
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about policy medical
 
03:59:47.120 --> 03:59:48.710 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about policy medical
intervention

intervention
 
03:59:51.189 --> 03:59:51.199 align:start position:0%

04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
for the house it's the
 
04:02:25.680 --> 04:02:26.550 align:start position:0%
for the house it's the
whole

04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
legislature's duty to hear the people
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
you're the ones who are here listening
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i just
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that
 
04:02:37.510 --> 04:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
so this is terese
 
04:02:39.030 --> 04:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
my name is therese grinnell i'm a
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
registered nurse for over 10 years
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
working with critically ill patients
 
04:02:45.670 --> 04:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
here in concord i appreciate having my
 
04:02:48.229 --> 04:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
statement read by a fellow patriot as i
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
have been prohibited from attending
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of being charged with a
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
disorderly conduct
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of being accused of saying
 
04:03:01.269 --> 04:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
amen at a previous public hearing
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
my questions to this committee are
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
number one why are we allowing doctors
 
04:03:07.750 --> 04:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
to be bullied
 
04:03:09.030 --> 04:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
told they
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
will be fired via email by concord
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
hospital if they prescribe ivermectin
 
04:03:18.070 --> 04:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
even though we now have an nih
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
government published medical journal
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
that states ivermectin is 86 effective
 
04:03:26.790 --> 04:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
in reducing covid19 symptoms
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
this medical journal has been emailed to
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
rep laying
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
number two why are doctors being told
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
they cannot write a medical exemption
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
for vaccine mandate for employment for a
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
person who has already recovered from
 
04:03:44.950 --> 04:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
covit 19 and lab tests reflect a higher
 
04:03:47.010 --> 04:03:47.020 align:start position:0%
level of antibodies
 
04:03:47.020 --> 04:03:48.389 align:start position:0%
level of antibodies
[Music]

04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
than a fully vaccinated individual
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
why should these individuals be forced
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
to take a warp speed new vaccine with
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
risk of adverse reactions or lose their
 
04:03:58.960 --> 04:03:59.910 align:start position:0%
risk of adverse reactions or lose their
job

04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
job
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
scientifically it makes zero sense
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
number three
 
04:04:06.389 --> 04:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
how is it possible government overreach
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure
 
04:04:10.469 --> 04:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
the workplace is not violating
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
civil rights
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
exemptions are being approved and denied
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
with no consistent constitutional basis
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
some employers approving all some
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
denying all
 
04:04:23.189 --> 04:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
some approving and denying the same
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
exact submissions
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
since we do
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry since when do we allow
 
04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination coercion hostility and
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
harassment in the workplace typically at
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
the hands of human resource department
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
and number four we
 
04:04:42.630 --> 04:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
still do not have the fda approved
 
04:04:42.640 --> 04:04:43.670 align:start position:0%
still do not have the fda approved
vaccine

04:04:43.670 --> 04:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
in stock to administer truth is if we as
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
employees take vaccine today to keep our
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
jobs our health insurance policies no
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
longer cover us
 
04:04:57.750 --> 04:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
as most policies become null and void if
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
the deep if the deceased has had
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
any experimental pharmaceutical
 
04:05:04.000 --> 04:05:05.750 align:start position:0%

number five
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
how is it that right to try is being
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
denied to families here in new hampshire
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
a youtube video was sent to me by a
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
medic medical director at dartmouth and
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
at 302
 
04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
three minutes two seconds the
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
administration speaks to the fact that
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
only their protocols are to be followed
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
families requests are to be dismissed
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
i have emailed that video to rep lang
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
why would we ever allow this to be okay
 
04:05:40.950 --> 04:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
what if this was your loved one
 
04:05:43.269 --> 04:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
in closing the risk of contacting
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
covid19 in the next 12 months on
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
historic numbers
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
is 3 percent with a 99.8
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
survival rate
 
04:05:56.150 --> 04:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
that is without proven treatments
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
that are safe and affordable yet being
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
denied to the public
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
this warp speed manufactured injection
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
is lasting on average six months with a
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
risk of adverse reactions such as heart
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
conditions blood clotting neurological
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
and even death
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
more now than all other vaccines
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
combined as documented in vares
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
it is interesting that most of the
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
population who was vaccinated early on
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
or over six months ago should now be
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
considered unvaccinated yet they were
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
they are given privileges to work
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
mandating the vaccine is like telling
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
someone else to wear a jacket because
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
you are cold
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
you can still contract into and transmit
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
and we have done a horrible job
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
educating the general public of such
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
which has also led to hospitalizations
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
and death
 
04:06:52.389 --> 04:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
when we realize
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
several things here that are just not
 
04:06:55.760 --> 04:06:56.710 align:start position:0%
several things here that are just not
okay

04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
we have destroyed so many lives by not
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
treating an initial posit an initial
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
positive result we have destroyed our
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
destroying livelihoods communities are
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
divided schools are a mess hospitals are
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
insanely short-staffed nursing homes are
 
04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
hell on earth with frail individuals who
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
are fully vaccinated having outbreaks
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
and agency staff filling in with no clue
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
about the patient
 
04:07:26.950 --> 04:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
i am an rn a foster mom and have put
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
everything on the line to do what is
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
right i beg you to do the same
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
lives are being lost right here right
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
now because of horrible health policies
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
you cannot leave here today and say you
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
did not know you know
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's time to start saving lives and
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
saving new hampshire therese grinnell
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of the new hampshire noble nine
 
04:07:51.910 --> 04:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
arrested on 1013 participating in
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
the political process
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:56.980 --> 04:07:56.990 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:58.070 align:start position:0%
all right
[Music]

04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who wish to speak
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
so for the committee i think um what
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing next is we'll take up
 
04:08:07.590 --> 04:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
wednesday we'll come in the morning if
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's anybody here that wishes to
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
testify we'll allow testimony and then
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
we'll go immediately into a work session
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
to talk about what a committee report
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
might look like
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
and um what the next actions will be
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
my goal was to wrap it up by friday the
 
04:08:23.110 --> 04:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
12th if we can get our answers from dhhs
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
and the medical society that we put
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
forward to them um
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
in taking that so does that sound okay
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:37.040 --> 04:08:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
again i think that that'll be the
 
04:08:40.950 --> 04:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
general idea where we're heading we have
 
04:08:42.550 --> 04:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
to the end of the month but i'd like to
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
wrap this up as soon as we can
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
because i know people have holidays
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
coming up and those kind of things so we
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we get all the
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
information we can and then generate our
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
report from there
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing else come forward to
