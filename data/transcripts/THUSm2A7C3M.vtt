deler thank you Mr Speaker good morning
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
everyone I'll be
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
brief um this change to subpoena power
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
this proposed change first I believe
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
it's unne necessary the reality is under
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
current rules issuing a subpoena in this
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
house is a practical
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
impossibility what this rule change does
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
is it adds so many different steps and
 
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
so many different hands that it has to
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
go through it codifies a practical
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
impossibility into an actual
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
impossibility and then it does one more
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
thing we have a duty to preserve
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
zealously the powers of this body the
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution gives this body the power
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
of inherent contempt we have the
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
authority though we won't use it anytime
 
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
soon I'm sure to take a vote hold
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
someone in contempt and enforce it
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
ourselves this rule would give that
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
authority over to the executive branch
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
by causing them to take up a
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
contempt and possibly not pursue it that
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
pres that power needs to be preserved
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker as was noted the house already
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
has the power to issue a subpoena we
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
don't need a rule change to be able to
 
00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
don't need a rule change to be able to
do

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:12.670 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.269 align:start position:0%
do
[Music]

00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
that the change that's before us adds in
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
a procedure for when a committee wants a
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
um subpoena to issue they can already
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
come to the Full House we don't need a
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
rule for them to do
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
that but what this would require is it
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
adds in a trip to the rules committee
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
before the matter goes to the Full
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
House and the thing that is the most
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
difficult for me is that it adds the
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
speaker enforcement
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
powers and when we were in the rules
 
00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:53.799 align:start position:0%
committee we were told that there would
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
be a follow-up
 
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
bill that would elaborate at on the
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
speaker's enforcement
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
Powers I don't know what's in that bill
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
that bill as a bill would come to us
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
here in the house and we would vote on
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
it that's fine guess where it goes next
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
it goes to another chamber who may
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
change it into something we don't like
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
and then it has to be signed by the
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
governor so we don't know what powers we
 
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.389 align:start position:0%
governor so we don't know what powers we
are

00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
giving I don't sign a contract without
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
reading it I don't
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
vote on rules or bills that have not
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
been properly vetted and I hope you will
 
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
join me in voting against this one by
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker u i rise in support
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
of the proposed uh Amendment to the
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
rules I think it's important to State at
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
the beginning that I don't disagree with
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
the assertion that the house has the
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
inherent authority to issue subpoenas
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
the problem is that the current the
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
current rule is really very vague about
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
the circumstances under which that can
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
happen when it should happen that kind
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
of thing and that resulted frankly in a
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
very unfortunate
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
situation uh U last term that's what
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment is designed uh to uh to
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
change and it's
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
true that the purpose of this amendment
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
is to is to sort of limit the authority
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
of when subpoenas are issued and to make
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
sure that in fact when subpoenas are
 
00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:58.150 align:start position:0%
sure that in fact when subpoenas are
issued

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
issued
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
the leadership of the house knows about
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
it is on board with it through the rules
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
committee and that the speaker is also
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
on board with it um that's what this
 
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
does it provides a process for the
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
issuance of
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
subpoenas and which I assume as
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
everybody has said and I completely
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
agree with would be relatively a very
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
rare situation um as you know I've been
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
in the house for this was my third term
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
I know there are people who have been
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
here a lot longer than I have who have
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
said that putting aside the the uh the
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
situation involving the the impeachment
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
of uh former Chief Justice Brock in 2000
 
00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:45.079 align:start position:0%
they can't remember a time when
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
subpoenas were ever issu when when
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
subpoenas were ever issued so this
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
idea of issuing subpoenas to compel
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
testimony or to compel the production of
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
documents is is really a very rare thing
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
and if we're you know if we're going to
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
I think the IDE the whole idea of this
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
rule is if we're going to start down
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
that road of doing it let's proceed with
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
a great deal of caution let's make sure
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
that before that happens the house is on
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
the house leadership is on board with
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
that and the speaker is on board with
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm a committee chair I don't want
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the power to have to be able to
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
issue a subpoena on my own and I don't
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
want my committee to have the the power
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
to issue a subpoena on its own because
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
that might mean my committee will have
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
one standard another committee will have
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
another standard that shouldn't be the
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
way we we we sort of start on a new
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
process it may be a rare process but
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's one that's pretty important
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it's one that can end up in in the
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
end with um with with some pretty
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
significant consequences it's
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
correct that the speaker
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
could if this if the rule were complied
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
with the speaker presumably could order
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
the sergeant in-arms to go out and
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
arrest someone that had not complied
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
subpoena that hasn't that has never
 
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
happened as far as I'm aware in New
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think it's probably happened
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
pretty rarely around the country from a
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of research I I did my
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the Congress of
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
the United States last did something
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
like that over a hundred years ago in
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
1914 so it's a pretty rare
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
situation um it seems to me we want to
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's it's a very
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
controlled situation so that's why I
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
think this this proposed amendment makes
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
sense thank you does the member yielder
 
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
yields thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I just wanted
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify something if this rule right
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
now is voted down will committee chairs
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
and committies have the authority to
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
subpoena that's an excellent question
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
and I think the answer is we're not
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
really sure about that as as evidenced
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
by as evidenced by what happened last
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
term somebody some committee chair
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
apparently thought that they did have
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
that Authority um so uh you know
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point I think this is
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the motion before us is the
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment to house rule
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%

stations are on would everybody make
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker despite what you have
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
just heard if I know that whether we
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
adopt this amendment
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
or whether we leave the rules as they
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
are they are both crystal clear that no
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena shall issue except by majority
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
vote of the entire house membership and

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
lengthy procedure part of which we do

not know yet and over which we may not
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%

under the current rule which is very
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
minimal in terms of its wording um is is
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
confusing and has as evidenced by what
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
happened last term and if if I know that
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%

dressed in a proper business attire not
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
need to

00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
Prout thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
speak against this
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
amendment the only way to enforce this
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
would essentially be to make a motion to
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
reprimand a member and we tried that in
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
this body five years ago I was the the
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
subject of an attempt to do that
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think it went well for anyone
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
involved um and I suggest that we do not
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
adopt this and do not start down that
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
path again where the only practical way
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
to do anything in in regards this of
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
someone violating it is to go down that
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
road again which is not a good road and
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
also this rule is vague I mean proper
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
business attire can mean different
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
things to different people I mean I'm
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
wearing jeans today with a suit jacket
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly this is more formal
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
than I usually dress when I present at
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
conferences in front of hundreds of
 
00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.430 align:start position:0%
conferences in front of hundreds of
people

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
um so it's going to mean different
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
things to different people it's just
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to take us down a morass that
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
we don't want to spend our time talking
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
about again and again please vote no
 
00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.870 align:start position:0%
about again and again please vote no
thank

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you Mr
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
Speaker I Rise also in opposition to
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
this uh Amendment um for some of the
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
same reasons the prior um speaker
 
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned um proper business attire is
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
not defined in statute or in
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
rules so where do you find a
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
definition Google of
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
course so I Googled
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
it and what I found was that proper
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
business attire is not being followed by
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
a large number of the members in this
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
chamber today
 
00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.270 align:start position:0%
chamber today
including

00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
me um I'm not wearing dress
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
shoes and I don't wear dress shoes
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
because I've got a big knot on my right
 
00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.829 align:start position:0%
because I've got a big knot on my right
big

00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
toe more information than you needed um
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
I'm also not wearing proper dress slacks
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
I think they look okay my wife even said
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
I look nice as I left this morning so I
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
I'll take it from my wife that I'm doing
 
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.430 align:start position:0%
I'll take it from my wife that I'm doing
all

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
right but the bottom line is if this was
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
enforced and taken very seriously by a
 
00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.870 align:start position:0%
enforced and taken very seriously by a
future

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.430 align:start position:0%
future
speaker

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
um we would have a hard time dealing
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
with all of the folks who would be in
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
violation um I think it's a bad
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
idea let me say what's a good idea
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
though it's a good idea for all of us to
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
be respectful of the body respectful of
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
the constituent who sent us here and
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
respectful of
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves we should be dressing
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately that's not well defined
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
either but I think most of us know it
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
when we see
 
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
it and if someone defines appropriately
 
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriately then perhaps the
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
leadership from their caucus ought to
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
if it's a woman who's dressing
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
inappropriately I would suggest that a
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
woman member of leadership chat with her
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
um I certainly don't want to be the one
 
00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:43.559 align:start position:0%
doing it um we're going to have sexual
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
harassment TR training later today um I
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
think this opens a slippery slope for uh
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
many of us so bottom line is Google says
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
we're all all out of line not all of us
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
many of us are out of line um let's use
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
our heads let's dress appropriately
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
let's be respectful of this institution
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
and let's vote red on this please thank
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
not thank you Mr
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker Representatives Hall
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives Hall is a hallowed
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
institution with over 200 years of
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
history the history of dignity and
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
respect and the way we dress should
 
00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.750 align:start position:0%
respect and the way we dress should
reflect

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
that now the previous speaker spoke of
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
having leadership talk to the members if
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
they're dressed inappropriately well we
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
can't because there's no rule how many
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
times we've heard people say why is that
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
person dressed that way why are they
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
wearing the T-shirt ripped jeans casual
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
clothes sport know
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
and uh well we can't talk to them
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
because there's no
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
rule so when I first learned about
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
politics in New Hampshire it was 2008
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
and one of my mentors was then speaker
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
well former speaker Donna scitec and we
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
talked about how to dress in the house
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
and she told me she always wore a jacket
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
and my first term I had a friend who
 
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to go to the department
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
store and buy fancy clothes she went to
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
Goodwill she had two jackets and she
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
switched them out and then her second
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
term she had a third jacket to add to
 
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.750 align:start position:0%
term she had a third jacket to add to
the

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
rotation so this isn't
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
about calling a fashion police together
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
and and look at and see I always look to
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
see what shoes um being worn in the
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
first Roka she has best shoes in the
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
house but no one's looking at your shoes
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody's going to notice
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
your pants the public sees us from the
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
waist up we're elected officials and we
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%

00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker so on convening day
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
two years ago we gathered here in this
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
chamber and passed a number of
 
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
amendments that the rules committee
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
recommended on a bipartisan basis one of
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
those amendments which I was proud to
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor with the majority leader my
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
good friend from
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
Auburn which added language to house
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
rule 44 that is Up For Debate today
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
the rules committee recommended that
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
language on Executive session notice two
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
years ago because it would improve our
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
process it would assure that the public
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
is properly notified of our business and
 
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
that decisions to enter executive
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
session on the same day as the Bill's
 
00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing would be made with
 
00:54:14.359 --> 00:54:15.549 align:start position:0%
public hearing would be made with
thoughtful

00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
consensus the amendment passed on a
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
Voice vote and for the past two years
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
rule 44 has worked
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
well obviously this is a new term
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
committee membership is no longer tied
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
and with a two- seat majority on every
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee Republicans will be able to
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
report bills out with any desired
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation on a Partyline
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
vote our public notice standards need
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
not be rolled back for the majority to
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish its objectives of course
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
chairs need to have tools at their
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
disposal to move bills along and meet
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
our deadlines the existing rule
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately provides those
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
tools if a committee wants to enter
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
executive session after a Bill's public
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
hearing to honor a family in attendance
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
or dispose of legislation that the
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously agrees needs no
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
further work the rule as it currently
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
stands permits
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
that I've yet to hear of a scenario
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
where the current rule impedes a
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee from entering executive
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
session for good
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
reason house rule 44 as currently
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
written and adopted works well for
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
committees and provides appropriate
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
notice to the public I urge members to
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
vote no on the pending motion to retain
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
the existing rule on Executive session
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
notice thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
Sweeny thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
two years ago this house passed on a
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis a rule change
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
reflective of the makeup of the house at
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
the time in order to Ure a fair process
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh for all bills coming forward in the
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
last few weeks I have heard a lot from
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
constituents my colleagues here in this
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
house many of you about traditions and
 
00:56:09.789 --> 00:56:09.799 align:start position:0%
honoring time honor traditions of the
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire House of Representatives
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
now is the time as we embark on a new
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
two-year session to review the rules
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
changes that we made two years ago to
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
accommodate the the situation of the
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
house breakdown at the time and see how
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
we can get back to some of those older
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
time honored Traditions uh that we
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
hastily abandoned those two years ago uh
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
to restore these New Traditions uh old
 
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
traditions back into the house for the
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
future uh two years terms and
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
potentially even longer beyond that uh
 
00:56:43.789 --> 00:56:43.799 align:start position:0%
which is why I brought forward this
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
amendment to house rule 44b uh so that
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
we can go back to the Traditions that we
 
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
used to cherish as this body uh to
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that committees and the chairman
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
have the tools at their disposal uh to
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
act on the people's behalf as we
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
consider all of the issues that are
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
going forward in New Hampshire uh as
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
they they hear bills and their
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
committees or as issues come up that
 
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
committee chairman and their committees
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
can work together in order to move the
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
process forward and deliver Real Results
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
remember a time when under a similar
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
rule chairs despite the requirement in
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
our rules that executive sessions get
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
enough notice so the public can be here
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
to watch them if they want
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
to chairs used to post in the calendar a
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%

permitting and if I think it is
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
deplorable that we would not give a Time
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%

lot easier if the chairman could just

get up and make the itl motion to begin
 
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
recognized representative ner chair
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
ner thank you Mr Speaker the rule change
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
to house 64 presents some simple
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
clerical fixes to the rule it makes sure
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
that the security Personnel mentioned in
 
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
the rule are identified correctly as
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
they are properly mentioned in rule 62
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
and not rule
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
61 the amendment is in keep with house
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
tradition about display of self-defense
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
tools the house has limited the display
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
of firearms for years and this change
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
would be keeping with that tradition be
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
it Tartan day or someone standing at the
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
well where the slit in the jacket pops
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
open at the wrong time the goal of the
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
policy was always to prevent intentional
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
display of a firearm on the house
 
01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
floor sitting in the front row I have
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
had to speak to a number of gentlemen
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
when their jacket hiked up when they
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
leaned over to speak into the microphone
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
and suddenly they were in unintentional
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
violation of a house rule the simple
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
change corrects that issue by clarifying
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
that the issue at hand is intentional
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
display versus inadvertent display I
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
would ask that you support this simple
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker chair recognize representative
 
01:05:54.319 --> 01:06:00.589 align:start position:0%
Speaker chair recognize representative

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker this change would add the word
 
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
intentionally to the rule prohibiting
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
the display of deadly weapons in rep's
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
Hall I urge you to vote against this
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
motion because adding this one word
 
01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
would unfortunately become a license to
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
become careless with the carrying of a
 
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.109 align:start position:0%
become careless with the carrying of a
deadly

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
deadly
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
weapon carrying a concealed weapon
 
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
especially in this chamber means bearing
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to ensure that it
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
remains concealed and out of sight while
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
I know that many of my colleagues for
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
better of or Worse um do carry uh
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
Firearms into this chamber I can
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
honestly say that perhaps because of the
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
location I sit in in reps Hall I've
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
never personally seen a weapon uh
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
displayed either intentionally or
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
unintentionally here but one of the
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
reasons for that is that our current
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
rule doesn't have words like
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
intentionally or knowingly in it so the
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
bottom line is this if the display of a
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
weapon can be regarded as acceptable as
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
long as it's an accident we no longer
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
have an enforcable rule what we have is
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
the illusion of a
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
rule this isn't a matter of Freedom it's
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
a matter of self-discipline and personal
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility I urge you to vote no on
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%

01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:27.799 align:start position:0%

simple rule with a simple represent
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker there is a reason
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
why we require 3 fifths vote to special
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
order a bill and that's because these
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
bills are very special it could be a
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
widow of a law enforcement officer who's
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
died who's been killed on on the job and
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
who's here to watch a bill to
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
memorialize her husband it could be the
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
parents of a child who was killed by a
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
drunk driver who are here to w witness a
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
bill that would provide stricter
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
regulation on the serving of alcohol
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen these bills come and they're
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
always unanimous because they reflect
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
our humanity and our coming together in
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
a nonpartisan way to support Granite
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
Staters who are extremely invested in
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
the work that we do let's not change
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
that and make it a simple majority
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
because that will create Havoc we will
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
see special order motions coming and
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
going looking for that one vote margin
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
that majority in order to disrupt the
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
calendar and the public notice we've
 
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
given to our constituents to say hey
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
this is the order of the bills that
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to take up to remove that
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
ability to stick to our public notice in
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
our calendar is going to be create
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
confusion Havoc if it does not help us
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
fulfill our duty to Granite
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
Staters so I ask that you vote no on
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment let's keep special order
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%

for a very very long time uh his has
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
never been controversial a special order
 
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
motion is not the final motion on a bill
 
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
it just simply moves when you do it and
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
out of courtesy we should make it easier
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
for us to change which order we go
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
through bills to make it easier to
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%

01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
division vote chair recognized
 
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
if I know that requiring three fifths
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
requirement to special order a bill has
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
worked fine for those in frequent times
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
when a member of the public is here to
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
witness a vote on a bill inspired by
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
them or their family member like the
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
naming of a state road and if I also
 
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
know that straying from the Three-Fifths
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
requirement would invite chaos as any
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
member only needs a simple majority to
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
disrupt the scheduled order of noticed
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
bills as printed in the house calendar
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
and finally if I also know that we are
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
here to serve the public to serve the
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire not our own
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
convenience would I now press the red
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
button to continue our practice of
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
keeping special orders special thank you
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
know that what this rule change would do
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
is return us back to the tradition of
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
the way we did it before the most recent
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
term we did not see and if we if I know
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
we did not see all the problems that
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
have been stated by the other side of
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
this debate in terms of them being made
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
for trivial reasons them being made for
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
partisan reasons that just didn't happen
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
and if I know we did it last term
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
because of the unprecedented closeness
 
01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
of the house that we don't have a again
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
this term would I press the green button
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
to return us to the process that worked
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
well for many years and allow us to
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
special order bills instead of a more
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
complicated series of other motions that
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
all require 50% but accomplish the same
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker what
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
this rule change would do is allow
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
members to Prime sponsors of bills to
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
withdraw the bill later in the process
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
than they currently can is essentially
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
what it is and they need the concurrence
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
of all the house co-sponsors on the bill
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
to do that and so what how would work is
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
that if for whatever reason they find
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
out there's many bills on the same topic
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
they have a conversation with the
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
chairman whatever reason the prime
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor is convinced the right thing to
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
do is with withdraw the bill they can
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
notify the clerk get all the co-sponsors
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
also notify the clerk and then the the
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
committee chairman doesn't have to
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
schedule a public hearing and that
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
motion to withdraw it would go on the
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
consent calendar for us to vote on next
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
time we're in session now then there's
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
I've heard from some people and there's
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
some concerns could this be used to gain
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
the system in any way um and it's
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
written so that hopefully it can't be
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is is the
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
chairman of the committee doesn't have
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
to schedule a public hearing doesn't
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
have to exec the bill but it doesn't
 
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from doing that so if say
 
01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
me a prime sponsor Bill heard the
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee was planning to amend a bill
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
with a non-gain Amendment or perhaps
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
even a Jimmy amendment in a way they
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't like and they want to withdraw the
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
bill to prevent that the committee can
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
just ignore the withdrawal request yes
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
we'd have we'd have to get the people to
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
pull it off consent and vote it down on
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
the floor if the committee is all in
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
favor of doing that I don't see that
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
being a major hurdle and that might
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
happen once and then people will realize
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work um so hopefully this is
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
a an efficient way
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
that people can't gain for partisan
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
reasons to get bills out of the process
 
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
once the prime sponsor admits this isn't
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
worth anyone's time thank you and please
 
01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.510 align:start position:0%
worth anyone's time thank you and please

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
36e the chair recognizes representative
 
01:19:47.760 --> 01:20:05.149 align:start position:0%
36e the chair recognizes representative
Penza

01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I'm G to keep it
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
easy so I know we all um make tons of
 
01:20:13.629 --> 01:20:13.639 align:start position:0%
money in here so uh we have lots of time
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
on our hands and I just think that this
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
simple sentence um in our second term
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
when we're filing bills you can file one
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
bill on your own and then the rest you
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
have to have six sponsors since we have
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
to have 201 votes to pass a bill I think
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
this shows viability of your bill um to
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
be able to get six co-sponsors I don't
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
think that's much to ask and
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
um and that's pretty much it that's why
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
in a division has been called members
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is an amendment to
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
house rule 6
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
36e this is a division vote the chair
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes repres presentive tki for a
 
01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.430 align:start position:0%
recognizes repres presentive tki for a
parliamentary

01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment would limit every one
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
of us to filing one bill in the second
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
year unless we find six co-sponsors to
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
sign on and if I know that we just went
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
through a challenging filing period with
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
tight deadlines late drafts calls to OSS
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
and for many of us we didn't have the
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
time or bandwidth to finalize our
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors when we were simply trying
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
to get our bill filed and over the
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
Finish Line never mind worry about
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrary requirements for co-sponsors
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that each one of
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
us was chosen by our constituents to
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
participate in the legislative process
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
on their behalf which includes the

amendment to house rule 28 house rule
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
28 the chair recognizes Representative
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
Speaker well then this would make the
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
clerk of the house a very powerful
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
figure indeed more so than he is
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
now this rule would let committee chairs
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas the committee chair
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
shall confer with the clerk of the house
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
on the substance of the subpoena and who
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
shall prepare the subpoena and issue it
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I guess if I'm having trouble getting
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
something from the Department of Safety
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
I would go talk to Paul Paul will figure
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
out how to write it up I don't know if
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
he's going to get counsel or not I'm
 
01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:43.639 align:start position:0%
shocked that this rule doesn't say that
 
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
you confer with house counsel and then
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
when that's all done um it says issue it
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
so he's going to drive out to
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner Quinn's house and serve
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
him I am not sure that's how any of this
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
is supposed to
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
work who is the person who will defend
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
any incoming lawsuits or challenges the
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
clerk of the house has to get a lawyer
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
the reason the Speaker of the House does
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
it because we have house counsel and the
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
speaker is the
 
01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
client house counsel also knows about
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
some of these things and can issue the
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
proper form so it's um not a great idea
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
but even if you think it is it's poorly
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
thought out and can't possibly work so
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
please vote against the amendment do you
 
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker currently if everybody reads the
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
current rule in place which is going to
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
stay in place if we don't make a
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
change all all all I'm changing is the
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
entire house
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
membership goes to committee the entire
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee votes on a subpoena
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
and then the committee chair works that
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
out specifically
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
with the clerk to write up a
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
subpoena there's nothing else in there
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
the other one was very complicated had a
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
lot of different parts and pieces to
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
it I really don't understand why our
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
rule currently does not align with the
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
subpena process that many states and
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
Congress is already consistent with if
 
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
it's 100% with Mason's Manual of
 
01:27:29.709 --> 01:27:29.719 align:start position:0%
legislative procedure that is our book
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
that we should be looking to and
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
committees are closest to the subject
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
matter and the issues at
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
hand I there's been a lot of talk about
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
this today and I just don't understand
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
we're all talking about you know going
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
after people or anything like that it's
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
not about that I want to be able to as a
 
01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
committee if we're looking for
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
information and we're getting a
 
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
roadblock I want to be able to get that
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
information whether whatever it may be
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
whatever committee you're in let's say
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's from an agency that's not
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
responding it would be really great to
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
be able to get them a certified letter
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
from the house from a committee to say
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
Hey you have to provide us that
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
information that's as simple it is I
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't have any other things in here I
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
keep it very clean I keep it simple this
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
proposal really is a step towards more
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
effective governance by simplifying the
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
process and ensuring equal power among
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
all committees this amendment ensures
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
that subpoena power is not vested in one
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
person and reduces legislators need to
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
jump through unattainable
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr

Speaker Mr Speaker this rule proposes to
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
bring us back to where we were a few
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
years ago um making members have to hide
 
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
their firearms and disobey rules because
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
I know that no one here is voluntarily
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
going to give up their constitutional
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
right we ask a lot of the members here
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
we we work a lot for a 100 bucks and we
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
take our safety seriously which is why a
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
lot of Us
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
carry every morning before I come here I
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
contemplate the danger that I'm going to
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
face and that a lot of children are
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
going to face and I'm not talking about
 
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
here I'm talking about on the road to
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
get here because that's where more
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
people die than worrying about children
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
being exposed to
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Firearms everyone here is responsible
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
lawful gun owner if we're going to take
 
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:30.280 align:start position:0%
this right away from us what's next
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to speak
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
anymore because it might hurt somebody's
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
feelings we should have every right that
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
every other citizen does because we
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
should be an example to the freedoms of
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
the people in New Hampshire I would ask
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
Speaker the amendment before us today
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
would restore a house rule that until
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
2011 had stood for over 40 years so if
 
01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about going back to
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
traditions of the New Hampshire house
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
this is actually a good way to do it if
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
we approve this amendment carrying or
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
possessing deadly weapons in this
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
chamber the gallery or our anti rooms
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
would once again be
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
prohibited New Hampshire is currently in
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
the minority of legislative B IES across
 
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
the country that allow deadly weapons to
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
be brought into the chamber while
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
displaying them is prohibited under our
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
current rules concealing them and
 
01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
bringing them onto the floor is
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
allowed those who favor the current role
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
argue that banning guns from the chamber
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
would make us all soft targets for
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
terrorists and mass Shooters my reply to
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
that is the same as it was in 2023 when
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
I introduced a similar Amendment welcome
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
to the club with more firearms in
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
circulation than ever before it's become
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
sadly apparent that more guns in more
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
places is not part of the solution it's
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
the biggest part of the problem as a
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
nation we remain number one when it
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
comes to both our firearm homicide rate
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
and our firearm suicide rate and no
 
01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
other country is even
 
01:34:18.189 --> 01:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
close guns do not make legislators safer
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
or our constituents safer they simply
 
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
make more people dead
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
last year in this chamber we saw how
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
quickly an argument between legislators
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
could escalate into a physical
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
confrontation I have no idea if either
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
legislator was armed at the time but
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
firing a weapon in a crowded chamber
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
either intentionally in self-defense or
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
completely by accident comes with
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous risks were we lucky that time
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but something I am sure of
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
is that I don't want to depend on luck
 
01:34:56.669 --> 01:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
the next time the tempers flare or the
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
next time someone's firearm falls out of
 
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
a purse or falls out of a
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
holer Beyond concern for Public Safety
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
and our own individual rights this issue
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
raises a key question is the people's
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
house an appropriate or a necessary
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
place for legislators to carry guns or
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
other weapons or should it be a place
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
reserved for Goodwill healthy debates
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
and our best ideas for moving this state
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
forward so we can help all of our
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
constituents lead Better
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
Lives we don't allow weapons to be
 
01:35:31.149 --> 01:35:31.159 align:start position:0%
carried into our courtrooms we don't
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
allow them to be carried into our
 
01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
prisons and whether openly displayed or
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
concealed we should never allow them to
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
be carried into the people's house by
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
anyone other than the Troopers and the
 
01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%

01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is floor amend M to
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
house rule 64 this is a roll call vote
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%

01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
people's house every right should be
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
observed not just some of them and if I
 
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
know that in the people's house we lead
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
by example we have freedom for our
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
citizens we passed constitutional carry
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
why would we strip ourselves the very
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
rights we fought to give our citizens
 
01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
and finally Mrs speaker if I know that
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
we are never going to support a rule to
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
roll back that and if I know that the
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
people that want this would also
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
probably be happy pulling all of our gun
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
rights not just in here would I stop
 
01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:51.320 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that if we're all
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%

01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%

amendment to house rule

01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh this is one of two rule rules
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
amendments that simply codifies our
 
01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
already existing best practices in this
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
one all it says is that if a chairman
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
institutes a time limit for speakers
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
that that chairman will evenly apply
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
that to the extent possible and in an
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
alternating fashion the vast majority of
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
chairs already do this this also allows
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
the chair to be able to give the prime
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor or whoever's introducing the
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
bill any experts anyone the chair
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
chooses extra time to speak they just
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
have to add a little note saying why
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
they're doing that what this is
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
preventing is the very rare but actually
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
existing examples of a few chairs that
 
01:40:32.589 --> 01:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
have acted not in the best way in the
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
past where they would come up with a
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
three minute time limit for the people
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
who disagreed with them on a bill and
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
then magically didn't imply that time
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
limit to people who agreed with them on
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't usually happen most
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
chairs actually do the right thing but
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
it has happened and we don't make rules
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
for the the good actors we make rules
 
01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
for the Bad actors and so this just
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%

01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
that have to do with issues that there
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
are National experts three days does not

01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
to come and give the committee expert
 
01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
testimony uh uh in this amendment I've
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
switched it to 10 days three days is the
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
Thursday for that calendar for the
 
01:47:00.669 --> 01:47:00.679 align:start position:0%
follow for the hearings for the
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
following week by switching it to 10
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
days it's simply the calendar before
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
that now I understand push back on we
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of bills we have a lot of
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
business we're always running against
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
deadlines we're always
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
behind but each one of us asked people
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
to put us here every single person
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to be a legislator every single
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
person who's a chair I presume wanted to
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
be chair and while it's inconvenient and
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
maybe even
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I think that including the
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
people in their own business is more
 
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
important than our comfort because we
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this job for them in
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
addition if we bar access to these
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
hearings because that we are surprised
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
three-day notice what we're really doing
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
is handing over influence to the people
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
who get to be here in other words the
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
people who are paid to be here here the
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyists so I just want to make sure
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
that people have more access to their
 
01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
own hearings their own business their
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
own government and I think good
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
governance is more important than our
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%

Smith thank you Mr Speaker so this
 
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
change would make it so that after an
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
election when the speaker assigns people
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
to committees the first named House
 
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
member would call the first meeting of
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
your policy committee at which the
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee who may have never met each
 
01:50:54.589 --> 01:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
other before will elect the chair and
 
01:50:54.599 --> 01:50:56.350 align:start position:0%
other before will elect the chair and
vice

01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
vice
 
01:50:59.470 --> 01:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
chair how's that going to work I first
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
of all if I want to be a committee chair
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
should I start campaigning for that job
 
01:51:07.390 --> 01:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
in I don't know June guess who might be
 
01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
on the committee or should I just raise
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
as much money as possible and blanket
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
letters out to anybody that might be on
 
01:51:16.589 --> 01:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
the committee and then once we get there
 
01:51:18.990 --> 01:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
I succeeded and the best campaigner wins
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's not always the best nonpartisan
 
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
administrator of the committee
 
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
so it's just not going to work I don't
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
know how the organizational meeting
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
would get scheduled I mean chairs do a
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
lot of work before you actually meet
 
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
they're going through the bills they are
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
arranging presentations and agencies to
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
come in and talk to you for your
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting and none of that
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
work will be able to happen until some
 
01:51:44.109 --> 01:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
other meeting happens and they get
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
themselves elected so please vote down
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment chair recognize
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr Speaker I'm going to
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
make this very short I firmly believe
 
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
that where there are 20 people on each
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee and where all
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
Representatives we should be
 
01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to elect the chairman and the
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
vice chairman of our
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
committee and even though for this year
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
everybody's been appointed the same
 
01:52:38.069 --> 01:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
ones may get elected if this bill
 
01:52:41.069 --> 01:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
passes I don't expect it to
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
pass but I want to give people some
 
01:52:45.790 --> 01:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
thought to
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
change that I believe we need in the
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
House of
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives we need to give
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives more
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote for different things
 
01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
that have always been the same in the
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
past I think we need to change them for
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%

amendment to house rule 52 house rule 52
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
and I have nobody speaking I guess
 
01:53:53.199 --> 01:53:54.830 align:start position:0%
and I have nobody speaking I guess
so

01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
I do you recognize representative
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker so those of you who are not
 
01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:09.320 align:start position:0%
completely no new know that for for all
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
the history of the body up until this
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
last term it only required one person to
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
remove a bill from consent and that
 
01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
worked really well there's one
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
historical example of one representative
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
long ago before I was ever elected that
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
did something but other than that it not
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
only worked well um it also was very
 
01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
important because I think it was three
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
years ago a member from across the aisle
 
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
from me pulled by one person pulled off
 
01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
a bill from consent explained to the
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
entire body how the bill actually
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
impacted County governments in a way
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
that no one had anticipated and that
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
bill was completely
 
01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the recommendation was overturned
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
unanimously by the body so when we have
 
01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
a thousand bills before us it's really
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
important to have everybody's eyes on
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
these bills because not all these bills
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
get read by every member not every
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
member has the same understanding of of
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
those issues so it's really important to
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability to pull things off of
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
consent calendar consent we understand
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
to mean consent of the entire body
 
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
because when we do a unanimous consent
 
01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
speech spe it requires how many people
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
to object only one one person can object
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
and force a vote so for all of our
 
01:55:32.589 --> 01:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
history of this entire chamber it's only
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
been one person that removed a bill from
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
consent until last term when it jumped
 
01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
10 so this amendment rule uh change is
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
simply saying maybe not 10 how about
 
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
three I think that's a fair number and I
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.669 --> 01:55:56.679 align:start position:0%

01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr Speaker I Rise
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
vehemently against this bill
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
not because I have any particular
 
01:58:28.069 --> 01:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
problem with the sex designation of the
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
chairperson in that position in fact if
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
this had simply offered to add the word
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
chairwoman I'd have no problem pressing
 
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
green my problem is that when used
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
properly the word chair is a verb not a
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
noun it is not who you are it is what
 
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing it doesn't become a
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
position until you add man man or woman
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
to the end of it and I think that would
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
send a terrible message if we can't use
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
parts of speech right thank
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
you chair recognize rips in of
 
01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
Speaker so first of all this isn't a
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
bill this is an amendment to
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
rules so we should use language properly
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
chair is a noun I see a few of them
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
right here also we frequently use the
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
word chair as a noun some words have
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
multiple meanings actually if you open a
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
dictionary whole pages of dozens of
 
01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
meanings for one word so yes chair does
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
mean a chairperson chair person is a
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
long word I thought chair nice short
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
sweet would be a better gender neutral
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
term and this replicates the process
 
01:59:40.270 --> 01:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
that OS currently goes through when you
 
01:59:43.229 --> 01:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
ask them to draft a bill if they come
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
across gendered language currently in
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
law they will automatically fix that
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
language that's what they've been doing
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
for years so this simply applies that to
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
our rules which OS does not have
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
anything to do with chair is just a
 
02:00:02.189 --> 02:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
short simple inclusive version and I
 
02:00:04.069 --> 02:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
don't think that people's genitals have
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the position so I
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't think chair man or chair woman
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
will be in order and with that I
 
02:00:13.069 --> 02:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
02:00:15.629 --> 02:00:15.639 align:start position:0%

Smith thank you Mr
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
Speaker this rule would change the
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
current practice where a committee chair
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
can wave referral of a bill to requiring
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
a vote of the
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
committee so here's the problem
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
we're signing bills right now committees
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily meeting right
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
now the committee chair sees no this
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't belong here and we've
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
already had one request for this now
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
they can't do anything about it without
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
scheduling a meeting of the committee
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
which by the way has to be noticed in
 
02:03:41.950 --> 02:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
the calendar because when you're dealing
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
with a quorum of the committee it's a
 
02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:45.310 align:start position:0%
with a quorum of the committee it's a
public

02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
meeting there could be times where this
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
pushes you past a deadline just so the
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee can meet and go oh yeah that
 
02:03:57.870 --> 02:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong here so um just it will
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
definitely take more time and the likely
 
02:04:02.589 --> 02:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
result is they're just not going to be
 
02:04:04.990 --> 02:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
able to wave the referral because they
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
can't get the committee together to meet
 
02:04:10.549 --> 02:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
right away so please let the chairs have
 
02:04:13.069 --> 02:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
this flexibility vote against the
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%

02:04:25.549 --> 02:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr Speaker this is a
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh floor Amendment uh
 
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
sponsored by one each from each party uh
 
02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
the need for this amendment was
 
02:04:35.709 --> 02:04:35.719 align:start position:0%
identified uh last uh session in
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
response to it what was an inadvertent
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
mistake and so let me let me uh tell you
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
the very specific circumstances and why
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is more specific uh than the
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
previous speaker L on under rule 47 a
 
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
bill is automatically assigned
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh as uh to a second committee when
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations or other circumstances
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
are involved uh we review policy bills
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the first committee and understand
 
02:05:05.229 --> 02:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
the finances would be reviewed in the
 
02:05:07.069 --> 02:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
second committee the first committee's
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
done with their work uh by by
 
02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
mid-February for a two committee Bill uh
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
the second committee chair may want to
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
passing the bill but doing so would send
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
the bill immediately to the Senate
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
without any financial review what's
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
oever uh this amendment will allow to be
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
passed over to the second committee but
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
only after a review and a vote of the
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
full committee there's been some
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
concerns expressed that this would the
 
02:05:37.069 --> 02:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
slow the progress of a committee Bill a
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
sec a two committee Bill isn't expected
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
to arrive in the Senate until after
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
crossover day in mid April as we said
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
these bills would be coming out of the
 
02:05:47.709 --> 02:05:47.719 align:start position:0%
first committee and voted on the floor
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
in February so we can afford the few
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
days time for one meeting notice to make
 
02:05:56.189 --> 02:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
sure we get it right uh this avoids a
 
02:05:58.910 --> 02:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
problem that occurred where Finance
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
review was waved off when there were
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
significant Appropriations consequences
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
last year and on one occasion we believe
 
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
that the past version of the bill uh had
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
been later amended making the
 
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
Appropriations much more
 
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
substantial uh the co-sponsor and I
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
agreed we would Advance this rule change
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of which party was in the
 
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
majority and uh I'm happy to do that uh
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
here here uh it is not a
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
partisan uh Amendment this is just a
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
good governance Amendment you know we're
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
here as volunteers we know we have a
 
02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
major lift to balance the budget and
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
preserve essential services for granted
 
02:06:38.549 --> 02:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
Staters whether by accident or design we
 
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
should make full use of the skills of
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisles or at least
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
allowing them to weigh in before uh
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
forgoing the critical review of the
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
budget and implications of a
 
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
bill uh this structure of the amendment
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
still allows for a majority of vote of
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
the committee uh uh to wave Financial
 
02:06:59.790 --> 02:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
committee review for example uh after a
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
vote so this bipartisan request does not
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
limit the ability of the majority party
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
to jump the line it just does so with
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
more protections against a mistake with
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
more transparency I think we can work
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
together build a better budget and a
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
stronger New Hampshire please uh join
 
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.480 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know

schedule where we're going to process
 
02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
800,000 bills in like 90 days which is
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
insane and if I trust our committee
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
chairman to do a good job managing that
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker uh if I
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
know that bills are assigned to a second
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee for very sound reasons and if
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
I know the first committees frequently
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
defer discussion of Financial and other
 
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
matters knowing they will be discussed
 
02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:17.559 align:start position:0%
later and if I know that we have time to
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%

speak thank you Mr
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker this is also a rules amendment
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
that simply codifies what we already do
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
it says basically what we already do
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
that when a chair gets a Minority Report
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
and this is usually if it's an issue at
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
all an issue with minority reports the
 
02:11:38.669 --> 02:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
chair receives the reports from the
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
committee on a bill if the chair thinks
 
02:11:43.149 --> 02:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be changes usually
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
to The Minority Report that those
 
02:11:46.830 --> 02:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
changes should be agreed to by the
 
02:11:49.069 --> 02:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
author and this requires that it be
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
signed consent for those changes
 
02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
um in the past not always most chairs do
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
it correctly but some chairs have edited
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
material in a Minority Report without
 
02:12:04.350 --> 02:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
permission in addition it's happened on
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
occasion that chairs have kind of
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
pretended to not have received the
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
Minority Report resulting in The
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
Minority Report not even being in the
 
02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
calendar whatsoever so this says that
 
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
the chair has to follow that and submit
 
02:12:18.549 --> 02:12:18.559 align:start position:0%
it in a timely way if it's changed it
 
02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
has to be agreed to by the author and if
 
02:12:23.549 --> 02:12:23.559 align:start position:0%
the chair simply doesn't submit it even
 
02:12:25.709 --> 02:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
though they received it then the report
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
would be printed in the calendar without
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%

02:23:02.270 --> 02:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
don't know about his elimination of the
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
guinea worm and what that horrible um
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
parasite would do is an interesting
 
02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
thing to
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
Google and it's quite an
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
accomplishment that I say he's a Nobel
 
02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
Prize winner for his human rights
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
work and the thing that um
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
inspired me and probably many of you the
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
Camp David Accords we brought together
 
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
monum vean and onor Sadat in a
 
02:23:34.830 --> 02:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
successful way and one of my professors
 
02:23:37.630 --> 02:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
when I was in college he had served as
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
an interpreter and um assisted President
 
02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
Carter in that he was my favorite
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
professor and I took every class of his
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
I could Dr Abdul aiz SED originally from
 
02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:53.630 align:start position:0%
I could Dr Abdul aiz SED originally from
Syria

02:23:53.630 --> 02:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
and then there's Habitat for Humanity I
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
mean the list of things that go on I
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
mean how many of us picked up a hammer
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
to help uh with hurricane relief for
 
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
building new homes in areas that uh
 
02:24:09.469 --> 02:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
needed new housing probably be a good
 
02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
idea to do that
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
here and I think the reason why I was
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
compelled to ask to give this talk is um
 
02:24:21.630 --> 02:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
just the personal note of Cath TH Rogers
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
who is a colleague who passed away a
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
couple years ago worked for Jimmy Carter
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
and his presence in New Hampshire was
 
02:24:33.269 --> 02:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
really interesting and at his at Kathy
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
Rogers funeral Senator Shaheen told
 
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
hilarious story about Kathy somehow
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
getting a a pig into the opponent's
 
02:24:44.590 --> 02:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
office and somehow connecting that to
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
farm uh policy anyway I feel like Kathy
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
Rogers is with us here today to honor
 
02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
him she probably would have written a
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
better speech than I'm than I'm giving
 
02:24:58.910 --> 02:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
and when I listen to the speaker of the
 
02:25:03.309 --> 02:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
US House and the Senate leader in DC and
 
02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
the vice president they all three of
 
02:25:07.870 --> 02:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
them said he was the first president
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
that they were aware of as a gen xer he
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
was the first President I was aware of
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
too as a first grader 6 years old in
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
1976 we got to vote with photos and we'd
 
02:25:22.349 --> 02:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
Circle the one and I was so excited to
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
Circle Jimmy Carter's picture and cast
 
02:25:28.429 --> 02:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
my vote that you know my school had I
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
think he won the
 
02:25:30.439 --> 02:25:33.590 align:start position:0%
think he won the
election

02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
anyway I just will say regardless of
 
02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
party there's so many things I could say
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
about him but I think you can agree that
 
02:25:44.349 --> 02:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
you can see within him many things that
 
02:25:47.269 --> 02:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
would Inspire any of us to be better
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
Servants of our public to do better as a
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
human being I think there are things
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
about his life that could Inspire
 
02:25:58.110 --> 02:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
anybody and his funeral is tomorrow and
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
he will be having his homegoing ceremony
 
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
in PL uh Plains Georgia in the coming
 
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
days and it's with that in mind that I
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
honor him with your um
 
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
participation and Mr Speaker I hope we
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
can have just a moment of silence for
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
this wonderful man and for his life of
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
