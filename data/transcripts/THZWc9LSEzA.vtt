being um not needed and also it's may be
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
a small matter but it doesn't list a uh
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
a landowner as one of the designes it
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
does have a member of the public on here
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't specify that it's a
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
landowner smallish but I'll be voting no
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
Timberland or owners of of current use
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
land the the that my is that that public
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
member of the current use board is is
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
meant to be a stand in for a um a land
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
owner themselves and uh the the um I I
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
understand where the
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
um the talk around 697 in this
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
commission um comes from and I would say
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
1697 does a very specific thing it
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
releases a report this November um in
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with numerous people on this
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
subject this commission doesn't Begin
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
work until the following year taking
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
into account that report um the
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
solutions that are going to be necessary
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
will be something that has to be
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
designed by a group um the it we
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just take
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
dr's um prescription we should take a a
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
look at this and let a diverse group of
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders come together and hopefully
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
put together something is um
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive so the the I I will be
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
voting yes and I would hope others would
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
St thank you Mr chairman um I'm voting
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
in favor of the ought to pass as amended
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that when we first had the
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
topic of carbon credits and how they're
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to affect lifestyles in New
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it be working or
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
recreating that um we brought this in
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
and now we are looking at a commission
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
that will hopefully bring us a lot more
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
expertise and help us to respond to the
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
Advent of carbon credits and in the
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
context of State
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
lands so this is an opportunity for us
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
to get ahead if possible and I think the
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
commission will be a popular Commission
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
help representa
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative the
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
Q thank you Mr
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
chairman so this this commission and
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill as it is is anything but
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
popular when the state Forester director
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
of division enforcement lands opposes it
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Timberland owners oppose
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
it in its current form in at at the way
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
we just amended it they oppose it
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
no other stakeholders support this those
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
are the stakeholders those are the
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
experts we have no business binding a
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
future legislature by passing a
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
commission now that doesn't take effect
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
for two
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
years that's
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
ridiculous right there's plenty of time
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
to look at the report from 1697 that
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously out of scitec they'll
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
issue a report in no report in November
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
we can interim study this
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
now and take a look at it in November or
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
a future legislature can easily create
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
this Commission in five
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
minutes right but when I hear from the
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
key experts and I hear from our own
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
group here that some of the members are
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
confused on this we should not be
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
passing this commission that doesn't
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
take effect until two years when the key
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders tell us they're perfectly
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
happy with 1697 the work it does they're
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
a little happier with this amendment
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
that the current use part is out but
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
there are still two members from the
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
current use board on this
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
commission we should re
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
re-refer this bill for interim study so
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
if we could make that motion I'd be
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
happy to make it I don't know whether
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
no is there any other members of let see
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative Darby you had your hand
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
up did you
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
l referring to me thank you
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative who are you referring
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
Lon Oh I thought you were but I know you
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
you don't look alike I
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
believe who is it you want go ahead yeah
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you a
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
gentleman representative L thank
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
you I I think we have no idea the impact
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
of carbon credits
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
coming coming our way and I think it
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
could be enormous I do think it's
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
important that we start studying it and
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
this just sets up to take the
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
information from the bill that came out
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
of Science and Technology and be
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
prepared to study it um I I think it's
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
tremendously important and we we we
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't know it's the stakeholders Beyond
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
who come to the state house it's
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's whose lives are very much
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
ected by the timber industry in those
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
communities up north and I think we
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
should be prepared we're not enacting
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
any law we're just getting set up to do
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
the work and study this important issue
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to vote for
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
it okay represent representative
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
wolf um I'm going to vote for this
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
because yes it doesn't start for two
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
years or a year and a half whever but it
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
sets it up we got the other Bill coming
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%

00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:33.710 align:start position:0%
 
important

00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
Rong thank you Mr chair I agree with um
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
representative lontine and
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative wolf that it is important
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
to study this before this bill came
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
before us I don't know about you but I
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
didn't know anything about these carbon
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
credits or the extent that they play a
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
role in our state and I think it's
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
imperative that we study this more we
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
get the key stakeholders together I mean
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
when I look at the the opening section
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill it says there is established
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
a commission to study the effect of
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
forest carbon programs on local tax
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
revenue and the Legacy Timber industry
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's incredibly incredibly important
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
for us to do and when we look at their
 
00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
objectives uh to to study the effective
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
Forest carbon programs possible
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
alternative Revenue sources for towns
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
that account for net imp to the local
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
economy you know in the other four areas
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're looking at that's our
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure these things
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
are addressed and I think having people
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
together from diverse stakeholder groups
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
to look at it is is going to be very
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
important and to Mr mcu's point that in
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
in the future we could set this up in
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
five minutes we've already been
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
discussing this for about 10 or 15
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
minutes so I think it's time that we
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
just move this forward get it in place
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
so that when we do have further
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
um information this commission can hit
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
the ground running thank
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Derby thank you Mr
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
chair um members of this uh committee
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
received emails from both um the nhtoa
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
as well as this morning um Mr Hackley um
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
nhtoa um reported three concerns that
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
they had um related to 795 they referred
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
to it as Timber taxation current use
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
references in what was going to be
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
studied as well as transparency they
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
were specifically referring to um the um
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
the deed the um the deed language so um
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh and um Mr Hackley uh responded and
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
said I agree with nhtoa basically um so
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
let me I'll just repeat sort of what I
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
said apologies for the repetition here
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
but this amendment actually addresses
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
the concerns of nhtoa the Timber tax
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
thing gone the current use references
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
gone now the transparency uh I think
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
that's honestly a a an incorrect label
 
00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
for the issue um the uh it's talking
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the the the
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
language says should um should carbon
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
credit programs be recorded on the deed
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
to determine that there's some concern
 
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
that some of these not always but
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes those um carbon credit
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
programs um are com uh carry with the
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
property if it's with the property you
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
know it seems reasonable that um the
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
deed is an appropriate place to record
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't know that's why this
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's why the commission needs to study
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
and that's why that language wasn't
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
removed but to be clear there were three
 
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
issues two of them are addressed one of
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
them needs to be studied um the uh Mr
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
Hackley said I agree with I have the
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
same concerns and and they're addressed
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
So otpa based on the amendment we just
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
passed is appropriate thank
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.070 align:start position:0%
passed is appropriate thank
you

00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
repr thank you just responding to what
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
Mrs rung said um nhtoa does not support
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
this neither does the D the director
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
from preservation of forests and and the
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
director that representative Derby just
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned so if we think those experts
 
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
if we know if if we think we know better
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
than those experts that this committee
 
00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
is tasked to work with that's a shame
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
because they've studied this at
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
length we have another bill that is
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
already passed this commission doesn't
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
take effect for two
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
years right and the stakeholders the
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
experts have told
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
us they don't want this in its current
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
form this morning in real time so I
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
caution all of you to think if you know
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
better than the experts then then pass
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
it and we've heard it clearly stated
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
that the stakeholders opposed this
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
bill repres representative wolf for a
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
second time I don't believe and maybe we
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
should ask that anybody has seen this
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
amendment because it just came down
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
today this
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
morning so I don't know
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
that and I won't ask but I just got it
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
this morning I don't know how anybody
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
else got it earlier
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
so this addresses the concerns that I
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:47.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday all
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
Bale thank you I just have one final
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
statement um and that's just that when
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
you get a number of emails from really
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
invested stakeholders you have people
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
who are willing to work on the
 
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
commission I feel that people will come
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
forward that have an interest in the
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and we need to believe in
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
the communities that support us and
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
involve them and I do think that this um
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill as amended really involves people
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
that need to be in the know and that
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
have so much expertise to contribute
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
because the best legislation comes from
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
opinion I have a question of
 
00:30:35.519 --> 00:30:37.230 align:start position:0%
opinion I have a question of
Representative

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.830 align:start position:0%
Representative
Kelly

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
Kelly
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
Kelly there's a line on item 21 says the
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
first meeting of the commission shall be
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
held before July 31st
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
2025 I read that to mean that this this
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is the time that you meeting has to
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
be started it can be started any time
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
before that so knowing how commissions
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
are set up and how long it takes to get
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
members on a
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
commission this is not a Comm commission
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
that is going to be have going to occur
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
in two years this is a commission that's
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
going to occur as soon as it's possible
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
and it recognizes
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
that I re I I'm reading this to mean
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
that the the two-year rule is not is is
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
was in the origin other amendments but
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
do not exist not there anymore in fact
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
it says November 1st of
 
00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:46.029 align:start position:0%
it says November 1st of
2026

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
2026
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
two I'm reading was
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly yeah to answer your
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair so section two of the
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill is the repeal so section one of the
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
bill would take effect January 31st of
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
2025 so less than a year from now the
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
commission could be established from
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
that point forward so between January
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
31st of next year and July 31st of next
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
year the commission meet have their
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
first meeting I believe that there's a
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
at that point we will have enough data
 
00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:22.519 align:start position:0%
um from the
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
1697 um Bill to start to have those
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
discussions I believe that you correct
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
that there are people who are extremely
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
motivated to talk about this issue and
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
so there will be it will me the
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
commission will likely meet long before
 
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
that July 31st date correct thank
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
you representative representative M mchu
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you mentioned earlier the
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
importance of keeping this bill uh
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
keeping this subject matter under the
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee and I agree
 
00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:54.669 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee and I agree
with

00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
you would it not be kept under the
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee with unlimited
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
public participation from any part of
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
the public any stakeholder in fact if it
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
were re-referred that's a just a
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
question to the chair could could we not
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
re-refer it keep it here within our
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
purview which is what you stated was a
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
priority and several other members have
 
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.029 align:start position:0%
priority and several other members have
as

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
well and and of course doesn't the chair
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
have the ability to caucus State I
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
stated that yes so wish you wish to talk
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
about what happened in caucus stated it
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
here was a priority to keep it within
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
the subject matter experts so I haven't
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
spoken on that but go right ahead well I
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
I I believe it's important to keep it
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
within the subject matter exports and
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
and pay attention to the composition of
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
the board and my suggestion is we could
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
in fact keep it
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
here clarify the the dates of
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
implementation maybe maybe implement it
 
00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
sooner so we don't you know in in in
 
00:33:52.279 --> 00:33:54.230 align:start position:0%
sooner so we don't you know in in in
January

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
of anytime anytime sooner if we kept it
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
here I don't want to get into an uh back
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
and forth with you how the the what we
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
need to do is go on with with the go I
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
cannot stop a mo a motion in the mid the
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
in mid motion this is just discussion of
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
the mo of a motion there is a motion
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
before us the proper procedure is to for
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
the motion to be defeated if the if uh
 
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.750 align:start position:0%
the motion to be defeated if the if uh
and

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we go otherwise I
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
have no authority to to pull pull a
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
motion back from the from the from once
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's in front of the committee would a
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
motion to table be in order uh no there
 
00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
you cannot table in committee uh
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative Al montain do you want
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
question and unfortunate by the way
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's in committee you
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
can't call a question
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.390 align:start position:0%
can't call a question
either

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
will uh yeah I just want to make one
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
more comment I think by setting up uh
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
this commission that does include
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
members of this committee we are still
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
keeping it in committee but I think the
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
things that have to be studied are very
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
Broad and will take a lot of time that
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
members of this committee will not be
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
able to do all that work on their own
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%

the question
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
um we talked a lot about stakeholders
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
I've talked to the representatives from
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
the North Country they are stakeholders
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
in this they're they represent people
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
from the North Country they support this
 
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.640 align:start position:0%

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott um what we heard was
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
that um the there was some concern about
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
um the length of time um the
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
qualifications to retake the test um and
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
um provides uh rul making for um Dees to
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
determine how the um what what those
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
requirements are whether it's work
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's work whether it's um
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
training or other uh recommend other um
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
other qualifications in order to retake
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
the test um this amendments in both the
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
septic designer program and septic
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
installer program that involve rules the
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
test of course um the requirements to
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
retake the test but as well as other um
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh requirements in terms of um licenses
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
like that um and uh providing Dees Ru
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
making Authority for these these
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive programs I believe is
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate and so just to summarize
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
this um this incorporates language from
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
um suggested by representative makoni as
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
well as the rul making language uh
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
requested by Department of Environmental
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
Services so I urge you uh to pass uh
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment thank you thank you any
 
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
amendment representative run thank you
 
00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.349 align:start position:0%
amendment representative run thank you
Mr

00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
chair um initially when this bill was
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
brought forward and and even with the
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
amendment I thought it was a great idea
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
but subsequent to the public hearing we
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
received a letter from a Mr Spalding who
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
is in this business and he raised some
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
concerns to me that make me feel as
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
though this bill and the amendment are
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time I didn't
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
realize and and I don't know if it would
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for Mr trobridge to
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
address us but that there there there
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
likely exists a disconnect between the
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
course that's used to prepare the
 
00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:38.559 align:start position:0%
examinees for the test and the actual
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
test that the test doesn't reflect the
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
course material and that may be the
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
reason for um the high failure rate not
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
the lack of experience in the field and
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
the course is developed I believe it's
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
delivered by an outside organization but
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
Dees ad ad ministers the test um I would
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
like us to defeat the amendment and
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended so that we can
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
move to have an interim study because in
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
all of this we have never had a
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
discussion about the course and that
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be a very integral part into
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
the certification of the
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
examinees thank you any further yes
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly thank you Mr
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
chair um the amendment um that's been
 
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
presented before us uh it seems a I
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
think about driver's licenses and we
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
give people three chances before they
 
00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
have to go back into doing studies I
 
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.079 align:start position:0%
think this is a little too restrictive
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
day any further discussion on the
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
amendment first first Mr
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
chair uh I wasn't when the amend
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh came out I did contact
 
00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:01.710 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh came out I did contact
representative

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
mcon and he uh he liked he he approved
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
of the the
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
representatives representative Darby's
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
also in speaking with this
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh on a memo that
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
we received in yesterday afternoon from
 
00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.430 align:start position:0%
we received in yesterday afternoon from
Mr

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
Spalding complaining about the quality
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
tests this I'm I'm told that by the uh
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
committee researcher that this actually
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
you can't even put this information into
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
the file because it came after the
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
hearing this I hold this to be a the
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
same thing that you were if you were at
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
a a wedding and the preacher says Speak
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
now or forever hold your peace somebody
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
running down the aisle says stop go back
 
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.559 align:start position:0%
forget about
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
this well no you have a chance to come
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
before this committee and testify so we
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
can ask you the
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions the fact that you didn't do it
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm not I I'll listen to what
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
you have to say but it's not going to be
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
determinative as far as how I vote so uh
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
I I look at it for what it is it's some
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's you're late sorry now I why should
 
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.240 align:start position:0%

00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
the the rest of us
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
for fact that somebody was out of town
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
when they uh when this was
 
00:46:03.069 --> 00:46:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
held thank you any other discussion
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
first time no first time as
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative run thank you Mr chair I
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
totally appreciate that uh chairman Rulo
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
um I agree with you the frustration but
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
um it's not always easy for people to
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing up here um it's
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
and there were some issues raised
 
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
regarding the contracted course also
 
00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
that many of the septic designers and
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
installers that we would expect to hire
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
these people who failed the test um
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
they're really one or two man shops and
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
they may not have the the payroll to
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
support an extra person um if if we
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
can't put the breakes on I mean I still
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
support an interterm study but perhaps
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
if we could at least recess the
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on this like we did
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
for um representative Kelly's bill um
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
just it would give me some time to get
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
further educated on these issues and see
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
if there is some uh credibility to them
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I would also like to follow up with
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
Mr trobridge about some of the claims
 
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
made in that Spalding letter but I I
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if if you would be amenable
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
to just you know having us deal with
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
this next time when I feel more
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.549 align:start position:0%
 
take

00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%

Vale thank you Mr chairman I will be
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
and um just simply I think we need to
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
get more people out there and hopefully
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
improve the rate of passing so that we
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
have this resource in our state we do
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
need we need people in every industry um
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
and we certainly need
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
people in the septic installing industry
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
things are behind and we do want to get
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
people certified to design um so I will
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
be voting on to pass as amended thank

discussion on ought to pass is
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
amended representative Simpson did you
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
want to say something I didn't catch you
 
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
before thank you Mr chair I was actually
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
um raising my hand to make sure to move
 
00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
it or to Second it but I am but I am
 
00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
happy to say that I think it we have in
 
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:19.799 align:start position:0%
so many fields we have on on uh on the
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
ground experience as part of training
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
and I think that hands-on experience um
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
many fields I hesitate to say every is
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
really really um important and so I'm
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
glad that we're um giving this uh doing
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
this hopefully um making this
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity available to um those who
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
will be in the field of septic so thank
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
you thank you comments on the motion
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended representative
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
rang thank you Mr chair yeah I still I
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
still have concerns with this um we
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
could have somebody working in the field
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
which I think is a is a great
 
00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity I agree with representative
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
Simpson um I'm not sure we have the
 
00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:04.799 align:start position:0%
capacity in to hire these people with
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
the existing installers and designers
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
who are out there and I I think
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
Representative donelly makes a great
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
point that if they fail it's just going
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
to prolong the ability for them to take
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
the test and then primarily I don't know
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
anything about this course until I read
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Spalding's letter and I know that um
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative Hoy had also um as a
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
certified installer he is aware that you
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
know there is a disconnect between the
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
course and a test I just feel we're
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
pushing this on thinking that it's going
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem and I I would really
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
regret if that happened and we found out
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
we're in the same boat we are in two
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
years so I I would prefer I'm not going
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
to vote otpa I I'm hoping it fails so
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
that I can introduce a motion for
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
interim study thank you thank thank you
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on otpa
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
I I share um representative Run's
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about the test um not only what
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
we heard in the letter that was that was
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
sent to the committee but also from
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
other Representatives that have taken
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
the um the septic system installer test
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the past and um
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
and reflected on similar challenges I
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
really hope that um that Dees uh listens
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
to this feedback and evaluates the
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
alignment between the um the the
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
coursework the opportunities to train
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
for this and the test itself um because
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
they the the pass rate on the test is
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
abysmal it was reported as abysmal both
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
by the prime sponsor as well as by Dees
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
and um I I believe that uh training um
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
that training on the job training of
 
00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
course is an is a critical aspect of it
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
but um there's also other aspects of it
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
that need to be that need to come into
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
play however um we also heard that um
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
there are limited spots for the test um
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
people that retake and continue to fail
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
are um taking up those spots and um and
 
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
that there's a real problem that needs
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
to be solved that I believe will be
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
addressed by this
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill that is the reason why um as was uh
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
represented in testimony described in
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that Dees um went to uh
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative mcon to begin with to
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
start this process I think it's a fair
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
step forward I think there's more to do
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
but I um urge a to pass as amended thank
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative wolf you're raising your
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
hand yes sir go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
I Echo representative Darby's comments
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
because I think unless we start to move
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
this forward and I'm hoping that Dees
 
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
has heard loud and clear our concerns it
 
00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
won't change and I agree that it should
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
be studied more but I think we need to
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
move it forward to get those people in
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
there and then if we need to amend it in
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
the future we will if Dees hasn't hurt
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
us when this committee reconveyance so
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote for
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
discussion did you want to say no no I
 
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.230 align:start position:0%
discussion did you want to say no no I
want

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh the chair wants to just make a
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
comment about testing and Publishing I
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
remember during the hearing they
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that questions that wouldn't
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
appear on the exam were published so
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
people could see it uh reading the
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
amendment and looking at the law I think
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
the disconnect if there is one can be
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
corrected outside of this amendment I
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
don't think it's impossible to
 
00:54:51.319 --> 00:54:52.710 align:start position:0%
don't think it's impossible to
coordinate

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
coordinate
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
testing um I'm a licensed attorney and
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
we can look at the tests from prior
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
years and then we have online testing uh
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
but the testing can be coordinated I
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
think in the the test itself with the
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
department so I think that issue can be
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
resolved outside of this amendment so
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support the amendment based
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
upon the other testimony we did have
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
during the hearing just thought I'd put
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
that out there and since I was the last
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
one to speak I'll ask the clerk to read
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%

01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:10.839 align:start position:0%
right like to reopen the hearing or
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
actually start the hearings on today's
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
agenda U so pardon for
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
the for about being late on House Bill
 
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
1268 relative to prohibiting the
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
issuance of large groundwater withdrawal
 
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
permits for the commercial sale of
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
bottle or bulk water uh representative
 
01:06:35.279 --> 01:06:39.190 align:start position:0%
bottle or bulk water uh representative
uh

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
yours good morning Mr chair and uh good
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
morning members of the resource
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
Recreation committee the record uh I'm
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
Tony Kaplan representative of the towns
 
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
of hener Bradford and Warner a MAAC 8
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
and here to talk about House Bill 1268
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
on L large groundwater withdrawals for
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a bottle or bulk
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
water and the idea is to prohibit large
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
extractions of over 57,000 gallons in a
 
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
24-hour period of uh groundwater the
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
reason for that reason to want to uh
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit these groundwater extractions
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
and and protect the groundwater resource
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
is uh twofold first off we see that
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
around the country um groundwater is
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
being pressured under pressure from
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
industrial uh industrial extractions
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
there's private Equity firms that are
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
buying up bottled of water companies
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
such as uh you know Poland Springs in
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
our neighbor State of Maine and Deer
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
Park others uh and the what these
 
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
private Equity firms do their business
 
01:07:44.589 --> 01:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
model is to try to extract profit from
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
these companies uh and how they do that
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
is by pumping up the amount of water
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
that they pump and uh you know bottling
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
more water and selling more water so
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's putting groundwater uh reserves
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
Under Pressure around the
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
country um the other thing is climate
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
change uh with a warming climate uh we
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
see that we're more prone to Drought as
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh matter of fact in the last 20 years
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire 11 of them have been
 
01:08:09.599 --> 01:08:10.549 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire 11 of them have been
drought

01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
drought
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
years uh and even with the increased
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
rain you know the uh intense rains that
 
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
we see uh what happens is that rain just
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
just washes off the surface doesn't
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
really soak into the aquifer so uh
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
another reason to want to protect
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater is uh the threat of climate
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
change um so also the the growth of the
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
bottle water industry is problematic in
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
itself uh plast the use of plastic to to
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
make these bottles uh you know it takes
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
2,000 times more energy to make a bottle
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
of water than it does just to use the
 
01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
tap water so you know that's that's a
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
threat again to the to the environments
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
that climate change becomes like a
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
vicious cycle of course you know
 
01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:54.759 align:start position:0%
threatens the it threatens the climate
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
which again is threatening the
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater so
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of the plastic waste ends
 
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
up in in landfills I think the estimate
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
is something like 86% of the plastic
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
bottles end up uh you know just trashed
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
in our landfills we see the bottles on
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
the side of the roads all the time just
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
being you know thrown out uh and if uh
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
if they end up in incinerators the you
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
know that's problematic in terms of the
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
air emissions and the the Hazardous
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
wayte getting into the ash which ends up
 
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
in landfills and into the groundwater
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
again as it leeches out of the landfill
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
so uh so it's just it's a problematic
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
industry in itself um so that's the idea
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
that that's the idea I'm hoping that you
 
01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
see it my way and and uh would seek to
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
protect this the precious resource uh
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
that we need municipalities depend on it
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
for their drinking water uh private
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
homeowners depend on it um what what
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
happens with the groundwater extraction
 
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
if it if it gets too problematic there's
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
not a lot of research done on the
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
effects of uh pumping bottled water um
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
but we have seen in some states that you
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
know you you get uh obviously lowered
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
groundwater T lowered water table means
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's less water available for other
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
purposes uh there's less water into our
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
streams uh streams running dry Springs
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
running dry um and even things like land
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
subsidence where the land starts to sink
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
and in some states we're seeing that
 
01:10:25.149 --> 01:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
happen uh so it's a it's a it's a public
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
resource should be protected and that's
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill intends to do so with
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
that I'll uh hope to take any
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative rung then repes
 
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative L
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
montain thank you very much very much Mr
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you this is such a
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
difficult issue because I don't think
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
there's any right or wrong way and I
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
want to give you uh an example of what's
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
going on in miramac and and you know ask
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
what your response to that would be as
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
you're aware we have the largest
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
groundwater contamination in the history
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire with pasas and it was
 
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
discovered in
 
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
2016 there are still to this day
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
families in my community and represent
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
of hey's community who are relying on
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
bottled water because their tap water is
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
so polluted and there's disagreement
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
with the polluter on whether they're
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
going to take responsibility for that um
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
to put in some type of a filtration
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
system so would your bill prohibit the
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
government or communities from being
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
able to address those issues when we
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
there they are faced with an emergency
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
like shouldn't we have the state be able
 
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
to say we have to pull bulk water uh or
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
we we we have to ban this because this
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater is so polluted that we need
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
to rely on commercial water to address
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
it yeah that's an interesting uh you
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
know hypothetical um I don't think this
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
bill would actually put you know present
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
day production of bottled water out of
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
business and it's not going to stop it
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
cold you know what I mean there's
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be plenty of
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
bottled water uh from the just what's
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
out there at present uh to meet those
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
kind of emergency
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
uses um but but I think that what we're
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
trying to stop with this build would be
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
the you know continued expansion upward
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
of of the bottle water industry uh
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
because it's problematic in terms of
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
protecting the groundwater resource
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
which you know is is a precious resource
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
and you
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
know as you as you can appreciate in
 
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
marac we need to protect the groundwater
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
um from pollution and and from you know
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's just for it's for uh for what
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
we needed for which is public health and
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
and drinking water you know we need
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
portable drinkable water
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I mean I think it it's
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
bottled water is definitely necessary in
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
emergency situations uh like the one in
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
marac today and I wouldn't want to you
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
know obviously not stop that ability to
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
use bottled water for those purposes and
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think this bill would do that
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
though for a
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
followup um so you say you don't think
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would prevent that but do you
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
think that should be in the purview of
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
De yes to make that decision rather than
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
just say the department shall not
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
approve any large water groundwater
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
extraction do you think they might be a
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
better judge depending on a particular
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
situation whether they need to grant
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
that permit okay so I see what you're
 
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
saying if there was an emergency such
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
that we needed to pump our own water for
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
instance because there's no commercially
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
available bottle water and it was an
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
emergency yeah I mean that that I don't
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
know if if that's you know in some other
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
statute that an emergency power the the
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
state can take resources from wherever
 
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
they want basically but that might be
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
something to consider as an amendment
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
mean in your committee I mean that's
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
about representative Lon for a
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I then had
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
the second thought that my question is
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
probably better suited for Dees but
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you could answer this question
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
where does the figure of
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
57600 gallons come from that is
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
something that the will be better able
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
to answer than I I mean it seems like
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
that is the upper limit of you know that
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
would that's what's considered a large
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater extraction I don't know why
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
is representative Derby for a question
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan for taking my
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
question um we I've definitely been
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
reading lately about aquafers across the
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
country that have been decimated by over
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
withdrawals um the Midwest is really um
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
being particularly hampered by it um and
 
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
aquafers are are large they they impact
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
a lot more than one Community um
 
01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
obviously New Hampshire has a very
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
different sort of climate um than the
 
01:15:18.629 --> 01:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
Midwest and I'm wondering if you have
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
any um uh are if this is something
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're concerned about happening
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or if there's you've
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
seen any practical effects of large
 
01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
water withdrawals um impacting you know
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
Community um Water
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
Resources yeah I mean I don't think
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're in the same thank you for the
 
01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
question represent I mean we're not at
 
01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:41.719 align:start position:0%
the point of you know people in the
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
midwest who see their aquafers is drying
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
up I don't think that's the situation in
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is intended to be
 
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
more of a forward-looking proactive
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
approach too to defending our our
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
resources I you know but I mean in terms
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
of the impacts uh and what the situation
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
is you know with our groundwater at
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
present I think somebody from DS might
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
you Brandon
 
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.110 align:start position:0%
you Brandon
Kern

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Brandon kernin I'm the
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
administrator of the drinking water and
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau um we're here to
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
testify and House Bill 1268 which would
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit our agency from issuing a
 
01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
permit for large groundwater withdrawals
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
that are going to be used for bottle
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
water or bulk water if they exceed
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
57,600 gallons over any 24-hour period
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
or that's 40 gallons a minute if you PP
 
01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:02.790 align:start position:0%
or that's 40 gallons a minute if you PP
pump

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
pump
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
continuously we oppose this legislation
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons and first of all
 
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire already has a
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive permitting process in
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
place for large groundwater withdrawals
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
ensures that existing water users and
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
water resources and environmental
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
resources will not be adversely impacted
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
in this process issues a permit that
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
permit has two things associated one it
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
has ongoing monitoring reporting and two
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
it expires in 10 years we have to
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
reissue a permit every 10 years and so
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
this bill could impact a couple
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
facilities that have a permit that would
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
need a new permit every 10 years with
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
the permitting process and the renewal
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
we reassess the situation we reassess
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
other water users in the area that may
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
have developed over time we look at the
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
water budget to the extent climate
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
change is concerned we look at that and
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have been building floting into our
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
permits triggers that address the
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
droughts reoccurring droughts we've seen
 
01:17:59.470 --> 01:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
lately where based on different water
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
level measurements or precipitation
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
Trends you have a variable withdrawal
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
rate in your permit it's just not a
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
one-sized fix fits-all type of permit
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
and so we don't think the prohibition
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
for um bottle water is necessary because
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
we have such a comprehensive um process
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
in place we also don't think the
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed because since the
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
law for large withdrawals was passed in
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
1998 and the rules into 2000 we have no
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
new operation in New Hampshire that's
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
relying on a large groundwater
 
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawal permit at this time and
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's for a couple of reasons one you
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
our our pering process is relatively
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
prohibitive compared to other states it
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
is so comprehensive but it's also costly
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
and timec consuming that a corporation
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to develop a new bottle of water
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
which are all printing process would go
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
to somewhere like New York or somewhere
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
where it's really easy to drill hole and
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
pump water without ongoing cost of
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
complying with a permit and that upfront
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
two threee permitting
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
process another reason I think we
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any new operations using a
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
large groundwater permit in our state is
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
that the marketplace has simply changed
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
you bottle water has trended towards
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers buying water from
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and treating it
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
substantially and adding their own
 
01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
proprietary minerals and vitamins or
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
what have you to it and and selling that
 
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
product opposed to the traditional
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
Spring Water another reason is it's just
 
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen in New Hampshire where people
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
land owners that have Wells have tried
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
to develop bottle water facilities like
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
breaking into the marketplace is very
 
01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
difficult you have to get access to
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
shelf space on the supermarkets you have
 
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
to get access to the transportation
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
networks and the companies in the
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
marketplace already have those in place
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
and it's hard for a new independent
 
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
player to to to get get those
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
things we also think that a large that
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
the prohibition is not needed because
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know of the permits we've issued so
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
far in the state for bottled water which
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
has been um six four have never operated
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
never even built their facility they
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
obtained the permit spent all that time
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
and money but never found the business
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
planned to pan out and never actually
 
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
constructed their facility of the other
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
two one of them never operated on a
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
large scale that exceeded the permitting
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
threshold of 57,600 gallons they ended
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
up just producing small volumes of water
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
and selling them at local country stores
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
and things like that and then the six
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
permit is for a facility that's in
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
operation right now but they essenti
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
replace free Flowing Springs that were
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
grandfathered from regulation you know
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
so they basically could just divert the
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
spring into their plant and bottle that
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
they replace that with Wells so that
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
they would have you know better
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
protected water less susceptibility to
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
bacteria contamination so what I'm
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
saying is just we haven't really seen
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
the pressure for bottle water um
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
development in the state what we have
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
seen though is you know 35 new community
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
sources permitted under the large
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
withraw printing process that are active
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
we've also seen four golf courses um for
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
irrigation that have been permitted and
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
active so that's kind of where you know
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
the growth for water extraction has been
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
not with bottled
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
water I do want to point out that the
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
spirit of house 1268 is is kind of um
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
inconsistent when you think about a
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
technically there's lots of consumptive
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
uses of water out there a bottle water
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
really strikes people emotionally we get
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
calls a lot when people see a truck near
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
a stream or a lake filling up with water
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
and driving away but we don't get calls
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
when there's a hose thrown in a lake or
 
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
a well next to a lake and it's pumping
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
and irrigating a soccer field during a
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
drought irrigating is the same thing as
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
extracting water for a bottle water
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
you're not Wheeling the water through
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
the environment it's gone it's displaced
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's either going on the grass and
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
evaporating or it's being transpired by
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
vegetation and then there's other
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
consumptive uses you know all over the
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
state the state itself owns aquaculture
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
Farms where we're pumping from Deep
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
Wells right into a tank that's just
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
flowing away into the Watershed that's
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
displacement of water water you know
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's manufacturers of different
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
products that use water that are pumping
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
water and shipping it away so there's
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
lots of consumptive uses of water out
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
there Beyond bottled
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
water I do want to caution that although
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature certainly could pass a
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
law prohibiting proh
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
prohibiting use of uh of large
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawals for bottle water um that
 
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
could violate common law um you know the
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
legislature works as statutory law but
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
there's another body of law out there
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
based on Court decisions going back to
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
England and the colonies and then our
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
own country's um judicial system that
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
establishes that property owners have a
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
right to use water on their land in that
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
if a law is passed just taking that
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
right away from them without some
 
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
compelling need protecting the
 
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
environment or public health that that
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
could be a taking and compensation could
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
be required by the state or by the
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
property owner from the
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
state um one thing I do want to point
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
out that if this were to pass we really
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
need to clarify the bulk water part of
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
this um right now we have bulk water
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
being um being provided all over the
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
state usually from Community water
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
systems that contractors doing
 
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
construction maybe swimming pool
 
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
companies that fill up swimming pools or
 
01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
even for Community Water Systems
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
emergency supplies for of water
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
Community water systems are relying on
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
tankers that carrying water from
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
Community water systems that have large
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
withrawal permits and it's not clear if
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
this would apply those that bulk water
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
situation and we'd be really worried if
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
it did because we really need that
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
emergency supply of water for Community
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
Water Systems when these small systems
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
have a well failure or a big leak and
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
lose a lot of water and need an outside
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative Rong thank you
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Kel for taking
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
my question um getting back to the
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
number of uh that's the the the
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
permitted allowable amount it's um
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
57,600 gallons how was that number
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
derived so back in 1998 and it it holds
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
true today we had two sets of
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
regulations for Community Water Systems
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
when you wanted to develop a source and
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
for small community Water Systems things
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
like a Condominium Association or
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
something um we had one set of
 
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
regulations and then for municipal
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
systems we had another set of
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
regulations and it seemed like the
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
breako for those larger operations the
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
Community Systems versus those smaller
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
water systems was about 40 gallons a
 
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
minute or 57,600 gallons a day you know
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
essentially it was a consensus number at
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
the time where we had that number
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
already differentiating the two type of
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
withdrawals and for developing policy it
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
was thought that that would be a good
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
place to draw the line it's it served us
 
01:24:41.629 --> 01:24:41.639 align:start position:0%
well I mean certainly there's situations
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
where it may not be low enough but that'
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
be a very localized rare situation and
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
there's situations where it's Overkill
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
where if you're in a really remote area
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
without a lot of other water users that
 
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
threshold is very low to require all
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
this work so it's it's kind of the
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
history of
 
01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:01.639 align:start position:0%
it representative Donell thank you Mr
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
chair for take letting me to have this
 
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
question um so I'm a representative from
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
Salem and I know that we have um
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
additional water source coming down uh
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
through the pipeline and I also
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
understand that there will be a mar the
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
marac uh Wells that are going to be
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
drilled or they're actually being worked
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
on to help increase that water source
 
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
coming down through southern New
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
how would this Bill affect that
 
01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.149 align:start position:0%
how would this Bill affect that
particular

01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
project to the
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
extent you know so right now there's
 
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
water being wheeled from Manchester
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
Waterworks all the way down to the state
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
line and so to the extent any of the
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
Water Systems be it Dairy plasti Salem
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
any a penu smaller systems want to
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
provide bulk water or want to allow a
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
new business that might bottled water it
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
would draw in the question the
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester waterwork large withdrawal
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
permit they have a well that goes
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
underneath the marac river and hooks it
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
and that has to be renewed every 10
 
01:25:58.350 --> 01:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
years so we're not sure how this would
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
interplay with uh that type of H
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
you Gary Abbott associated general
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:29.070 align:start position:0%
you Gary Abbott associated general
contractors

01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman again for the record
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Gary Abbott I'm the Executive
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
Vice President of the associated general
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
contractors of New Hampshire I will be
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
brief since Brandon kind of took my
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
thunder away representing contractors we
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
looked at this bill the original look
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
was we're not a bottled water company
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
but it says the department shall not
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
approve any large groundwater extraction
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
for bulk water so in the construction we
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
do an awful lot of water tank trucks for
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
dust control to meet the dust control
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
that Dees requires that we keep the dust
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
down for health and other reasons and so
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
there start to become a lot of questions
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't take too many water
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
trucks to equal
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
57,600 gallons so we were wondering if
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
this exclusion was going to impact the
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
construction industry and I know I
 
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
raised it with Brandon at our last
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
week's hearing and said this bill does
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
this affect me or not and it could
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
because I think there's real no
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
definition of bulk water and clearly we
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
consume some water in the construction
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
industry I would leave you with that so
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here today to oppose it
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh I think our system that is already in
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
place is a good system with the
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
Department approving uh you know large
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawals in the process
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
they go through so I haven't heard
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
anybody testify that we have a problem
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
with our existing system and uh would
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
hope that you would uh not pass this
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much and
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%

interesting to this day we still have a
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
couple veterans with us so um yeah I
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%

um it's uh it's what we do um that's
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%

bit and and uh as was stated you know in
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
addition to being a good corporate
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
citizen you know the international bed
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
Water Association has consistently
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
worked with the Department over the
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
years um and has supported uh the
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
permitting system uh and so you know we
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
haven't having not seen any issues we
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
don't see a need for this legislation
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
and would ask that you find it
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%

representative how many uh gallons per
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
day are you withdrawing I didn't hear
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
that I we regulated to that we do not go
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
over it I would have to get exact
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
numbers I don't have that in front of me
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
so that's under the
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
57,600 but how close Okay at some point
 
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
maybe you can send us an email I
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely will what you

committee representative Derby thank you

Mr chair one of the um thank you very
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question yes yes um
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns we heard was about
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
plastic pollution plastic pollution is
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
very important to me as well so can you
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
talk about what you know your company
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the Bott water industry in general
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
is doing to address pathoplastic
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
pollution and you know look for
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
alternatives to avoid you know filling
 
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
our landfills that are you know under
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
strain in New Hampshire you've probably
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
seen those
 
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
bills thank you yeah I I do think this
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
is a separate topic but you know what
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to touch on what we're
 
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
doing as a company um and I'm pretty
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
proud of this actually we we've made a
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
massive initiative here um we're proud
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
to say that every every bottle that we
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
produce is made with 50% postc consumer
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
plastic and we're doing that in our own
 
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
facilities we have one in Southern
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
California and one in Tennessee that the
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
owner is built um from the ground up
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
we're we're formulating our own clean
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
plastic and rep putting that into every
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
bottle that we're producing today it's a
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
massive foot forward for this pollution
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
problem it's 50% and we're on our way to
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
100% to close close the loop
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
completely you're
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
welcome and answer representative Wolf's
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh question my my good friend from the
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
Department handed me a piece of paper
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
that indicates they currently use
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%

01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
um would you ever consider constructing
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
one in New
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know that's uh I'd have to
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
talk to the owner of about yeah why not
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
not you know why not it's a great
 
01:35:58.590 --> 01:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
initiative it's a great initiative and I
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
think we're well like I said we're well
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%

I think that's anyone else wish to speak
 
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.629 align:start position:0%
I think that's anyone else wish to speak
on

01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
this if
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
not I'll close the hearing on House Bill
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%

committee members um this um this bill
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
would I know do one of the things that
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
people don't even want to hear it
 
01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee but in this
 
01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
case I think it has some merits and I
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
hope you'll listen because as you've
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
probably seen um or heard U on the news
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of problems with dams
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and it's getting
 
01:37:24.109 --> 01:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
getting worse we've had uh a number of
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
dams and um the gentlemen from Dees will
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
go into more specifics on this but the
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
number of dams that have been considered
 
01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know really a problem if they
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
would have fail has gone up drastically
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
not because we're making new dams but
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
because we're building stuff near dams
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh there was a a lot of uh publicity
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
last summer to a dam over from gtown
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
that would have uh I'm not sure what the
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
status of is right now but it was
 
01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
planning to be torn down which would
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
have torn a lot of people's waterr
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
property from Waterfront into mudf front
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I know just in my my uh District on
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
the merry meeting River there's two or
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
three dams that are uh having problems
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
with them and you know a lot of this
 
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
goes back to uh federal regulations and
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
what's happened in the uh electric power
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
markets there was a time back in the
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
late 9 in the 90s actually where there
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
was a problem a program called qf of
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
qualified facilities and that meant if
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
you qualify as a renewable electric
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
generator you were getting paid based on
 
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
what people thought the rates were going
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
to be into the future which meant
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the rates were as much as
 
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
three times the uh wholesale price of
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
electricity you were getting paid and
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
this spurred a lot of people into
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
putting hydroelectric facilities on some
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
of these dams some of them which were
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
there some of them which they
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
refurbished some they built new and over
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
time those contracts got so expensive
 
01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:48.679 align:start position:0%
that uh Public Service AKA eversource
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
bought them out and others just expired
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
with time because there was a it was a
 
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
limited amount of time so now you have a
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
situation where they're not getting paid
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
anywhere near as much and a lot of those
 
01:39:01.629 --> 01:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
people just simply abandon their license
 
01:39:05.229 --> 01:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
and to look at renewing that is very can
 
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
be very expensive uh there's uh Federal
 
01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
requirements on permitting and there's
 
01:39:13.629 --> 01:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
also uh requirements on putting in fish
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
ladders whether or not there's fish
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
there to go up the ladder doesn't seem
 
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
to be an issue you have to build a fish
 
01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:20.679 align:start position:0%
ladder if you want to relicense so
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's it's it's a major problem across
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and like I say I'll have
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from Dees Cory do most of
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
the he'll give you the specifics on this
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
but the reason we want to set it up is I
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
was requested to put in the bill by Dees
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
and as written this is sort of a almost
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
a photocopy of a bill that was done
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
20-some years ago and I regret to say uh
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
almost that I was on that committee too
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
we had come up with some actions and uh
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
the problem's back again and it's gotten
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
worse um as written I wouldn't recommend
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of Chang es to the bill and
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
I've submitted this in writing on the uh
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
on the um web page the first one would
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
be to to go from three to one members of
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate because as you know if we got
 
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
one member of the Senate to show up
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to get lucky so no offense
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
to Senators but that's just the way the
 
01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:09.639 align:start position:0%
world works the second one would be to
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
add a member from Dees appointed by the
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
dees uh commissioner like I said I
 
01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
submitted this in writing to their
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
website because I think it's really
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
important to have their technical
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
expertise as a member of the committee
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
and the other thing then and I this is
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
when really want to get a feel when you
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
you people hear more uh on this and you
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
obviously this is your field of
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
expertise but does it need to be
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
expanded to cover not just state owned
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
but Municipal owned uh dams as well
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
because I know a lot of town-owned
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
facilities are having problems I mean I
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
know of two in the towns I represent and
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
there's many more of them and I know
 
01:40:48.990 --> 01:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
there's I think there's another bill uh
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
out somewhere that would allow the town
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
to buy a Dam from the state before the
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
before the state tore it down so maybe
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
these things can be worked uh together a
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
little bit but uh and I'll take any
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions but I think the experts the
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
me got any questions by members of the
 
01:41:11.159 --> 01:41:13.270 align:start position:0%
me got any questions by members of the
committee

01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
no representative Derby and Then
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
followed by representative R thank you
 
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you representative
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
paron for taking my question I think you
 
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
said that you were on the commission
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
before 20 years ago or something that
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
studied a similar issue can you just
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
describe some of the solutions that were
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
um advocated at from that commission
 
01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:33.639 align:start position:0%
actually I tried to find a copy of the
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
report last week without any luck I know
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
there were some uh but also the the
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
the the world has changed substantially
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
since then because of the law the you
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
know loss of those qualified facility
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
hydro plants and there's so much more uh
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
develop velopment around the dams uh
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
with it wasn't there before and and the
 
01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
big difference is it it changes I mean
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of dams like that there
 
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
one over Northwood Meadow state parks
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
that sort of the whole lake went down by
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
itself because part of the dam failed
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
and then that clog that it went back up
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
again so it was really concerned is the
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
dam been damaged or not and so forth the
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
state's Park systems been over there
 
01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:14.679 align:start position:0%
looking at but that's a low impact Dam
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing for Miles
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
Downstream of that that all you do is
 
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
flood a bunch of Meadows and so forth on
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
the other hand there's a there's a dam
 
01:42:23.589 --> 01:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
in straford now that the school district
 
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
owns because they bought some land and
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
that's been upgraded to a substantial
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
impact because if it broke it could take
 
01:42:32.109 --> 01:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
out a road uh you know a state highway
 
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
so I I don't remember that I would I
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
would try to get a copy and submit it to
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
the committee obviously but I don't have
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
it on my hands right
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
now Senator
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
Bron thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:42:46.589 --> 01:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for taking my
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned in your testimony
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
that um this bill came about about from
 
01:42:53.229 --> 01:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
work you had done or advice you'd gotten
 
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
from Dees is that correct um correct are
 
01:42:58.109 --> 01:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
you aware of their current letter
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill where they recommend
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
it be amended to be more consistent with
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill uh 549 and their
 
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0567 s yeah that's that's what
 
01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:12.679 align:start position:0%
the gentl from Dees will speak of yeah
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
oh okay so I I just want to know but
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of that okay thank as
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
well as the ones I mentioned here
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
because I like I said you know let's be
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
realistic we're not going to get through
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
Senators to show up for a study
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
committee yeah that's true and I I would
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
want someone from Dees on the committee
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
you representative har thank you Mr
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington for taking my
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
question if I just quickly read the
 
01:43:41.229 --> 01:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
Senate bill and the Senate Amendment and
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
it very similar to your bill so why do
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
we need your bill well I guess I
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
submitted the bill quite some time ago
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
at the request Dees if you feel that
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
that bill coming this Direction covers
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
it adequately I have no problem with uh
 
01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
withdrawing this bill and then you you
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
people will see it when it comes out of
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
the Senate I mean there's no need for
 
01:44:08.109 --> 01:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
duplicate bills so if if just if I'm not
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
sure Mr chairman if I need to do
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
something on that but if the committee
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
requests that to be done and I have to
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
do it just give me a call and I'll do it
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
because I really don't want I mean uh I
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
don't think you guys like being here
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
every day any more than I do so um if
 
01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have one bill that's
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
going to do it let's let's have one bill
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
there's no need for two thank you for
 
01:44:31.149 --> 01:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
answering my
 
01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
question representative thank you Mr
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and I appreciate your
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
suggestion very much how do we go about
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
seeing whether the Senate Bill covers
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
everything in representative herance
 
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
bill or vice versa uh do we want to come
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
comes to exec do we it what I guess any
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chairman what is aure
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
to take care of that well we could we
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
can uh hold on to the bill until uh
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
until it we get Senate if it comes over
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
before crossover ends otherwise we'll
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
just either take uh either pass it not
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
pass it or
 
01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
I you know interim study those are are
 
01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.270 align:start position:0%
I you know interim study those are are
three

01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
options can't retain it because it's be
 
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.470 align:start position:0%
options can't retain it because it's be
otherwise

01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.669 --> 01:45:36.679 align:start position:0%
be should that would have been that
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
would have been last year so we have we
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
have three options we are if I'm not
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
mistaken i' have to check but I think
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
believe we are taking up all of the
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
taking up all of these bills that we're
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
doing today next week
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
week try Mr chairman if I can I will try
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
to get in touch with the Senate and see
 
01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
what the status is on that and get back
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
to you if that helps that that might
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
help anyone
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman members of the
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Corey clarf chief engineer
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
at the dam Bureau at the New Hampshire
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
Services and as we you were just
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
discussing um Dees does support this
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill if we incorporate some of those
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
changes that we've worked on in the
 
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
Senate version and I'll get into some of
 
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
those um here in a minute so as as
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
um the nhds Dam Bureau is responsible
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
for all uh state owned dams in New
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roughly in New Hampshire we
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
have about 273 state-owned dams uh about
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
100 of those are owned by nhdes another
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
100 owned by fishing game and the
 
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
remainder are owned by do UNH veterans
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
home and a couple other
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
agencies Dees is responsible for the
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance of all of
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
those Dees and fishing game owned dams
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
roughly 208 dams and so the average age
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
of these Dam dams is around 100 years
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these dams have not seen
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation in 40 to 50 years or even
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
longer time periods and so we're really
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
coming into a time in which we're we're
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
looking at our capital investment that's
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
needed to keep this inventory up and as
 
01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:37.719 align:start position:0%
just a quick study that we did earlier
 
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
this year we we analyzed all the
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
different dams those 273 dams and came
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
up with a figure of roughly $414 million
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
to repair all state-owned dams and out
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
of that 414 million roughly 300 million
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
is needed just for the repair of
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
high-hazard dams in New Hampshire or
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
high Hazard state owned dams there are
 
01:48:03.149 --> 01:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
63 of those one thing um to note is when
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
when this issue was looked at in 2004 as
 
01:48:08.109 --> 01:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
the representa Harrington mentioned
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
there were 20 29 High Hazard dams at
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
that time now obviously the state of New
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has not built another 34 dams
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
since that time the issue has really
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
come down to two things one there's
 
01:48:22.109 --> 01:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
increased devel Downstream of dams when
 
01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
development occurs um the the the dam
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
can be reclassified to a high Hazard if
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
the failure of that dam was to impact
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
one of those structures Downstream just
 
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
real quick on the hazard classifications
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
when I mention High Hazard it's you
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
could have a brand new dam that still
 
01:48:41.589 --> 01:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
meets that criteria has nothing to do
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
with the condition of the dam it's
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
solely based upon if that dam was to
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
fail whether it's new whether it's old
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
and impacts uh residents or businesses
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
Downstream in which possible loss of
 
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
life could occur that is a high Hazard
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
Dam so we have state of in Hampshire
 
01:49:00.669 --> 01:49:00.679 align:start position:0%
owns 63 of those currently and as I
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned roughly to bring all those
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
High Hazard dams into current criteria
 
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
we'd be looking at about 300 million
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
dollar of capital
 
01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.149 align:start position:0%
dollar of capital
investment

01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
so how do we how do we currently pay for
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
all all of this well currently we we use
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
the dam maintenance fund and capital
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
funds and general funds to cover the
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
majority of all of these expenses the
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
dam maintenance fund was created in 1989
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
and the the sole outside Revenue that
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
comes into that fund is from Hydro
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
leases the state of New Hampshire leases
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
nine sites to Hydro power developers
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
those sites such as Lakeport Dam on the
 
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
Outlook outload of
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
winaki uh ponok Dam up in uh Miland on
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
the Andre Skagen um we have dams over on
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
the PCAT quog as
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
well and so the the rent payments that
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
are based on the revenue coming into
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
those hydropower facilities go into the
 
01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
dam maintenance fund
 
01:50:01.229 --> 01:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
however over time the revenue has
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
significantly dropped during the first
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
13 years of the D maintenance fund that
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
fund was primarily um covering all
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
expenses at the dam Bureau and the
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because not only with
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
the expenses less at that point in time
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
but also these hydropower developers
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
were in power purchase agreements with
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
PS H at that time and so they were
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
getting anywhere from 8 cents to 70
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
cents a kilowatt hour for the the power
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
they were producing in in 2002 PSNH re
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
renegotiated their um Power purchase
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
agreements as as part of the RSA 374
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
which was the electric utility
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
restructuring legislation that came
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
through at that time so since then since
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
2003 the hydrop power developers have
 
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
been getting current market rates for
 
01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
their power which last year averaged
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
about 3.6 cents a kilowatt hour so not
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
only are the revenues going down for the
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
hydropower producers but at the same
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
time the regulatory requirements are
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
going up uh a lot of these sites are
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
seeing relicensing that is taking place
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
this is a license that is generated
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
through the Federal Energy Regulatory
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
Commission those licenses typically are
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
good for 40 years and a lot of these
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
sites were developed in the 1980s 1970s
 
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
so a lot of those sites are now up for
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
relicensing and not only the
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
requirements to relicense a site but
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
also the future requirements as part of
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
that license are really uh driving some
 
01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.149 align:start position:0%
that license are really uh driving some
of

01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
the financial issues that we have at
 
01:51:37.629 --> 01:51:37.639 align:start position:0%
these hydropower sites along with
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
obviously the declining uh return on uh
 
01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:44.030 align:start position:0%
obviously the declining uh return on uh
the

01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:46.350 --> 01:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
declining rate for power that the these
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
sites are seeing and so with all that um
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
with all that being said the dam Bureau
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
has continued to rely more and more on
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
Capital funds and general funds in order
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
to meet our goals and obligations for
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
the operation of the 208 dams and also
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
the repair and reconstruction of the 273
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
dams and so with this committee we can
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
look at is is it time to re-evaluate how
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
the dam maintenance fund is funded
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
should we continue looking at hydrop
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
power or can we look at other other
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
sources and as I previously mentioned
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
in 2004 a similar committee was formed
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
under s SP 488 to review the effects of
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
this electrical utility
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
restructuring some of the outcomes that
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
came out of that and this is the report
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
that was previously mentioned was um to
 
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
look at uh the unfunded roll toll or gas
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
tax to boers short front maintenance
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
fees increased fishing license fees
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
increased boat registration fees
 
01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
increased Ming permit fees increasing
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
par fees and leasing additional
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
dams however after after subsequent
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
legislative efforts in the years after
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
that uh committee developed their report
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh none of those we all the other all
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
the recommendations I previously
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned with the exception of the
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
first two
 
01:53:06.069 --> 01:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
actually were found to be deficient and
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
not recommended to the committee for
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
further analysis those first two I
 
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:12.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned the unfunded roll toll gas to
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
boers in the shorefront maintenance fee
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
failed to make it out of the legislature
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
at that time so we we continued to use
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
the dam maintenance fund since that time
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
however we've been continuing to rely
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
more and more on Capital and general
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
fund to to meet our needs and
 
01:53:30.589 --> 01:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
obligations I will add though however
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
we've been fortunate that there have
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
been uh Federal money that we've been
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
able to tap in tap into to help cover
 
01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
some of our expenses but uh currently
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're still seeing those uh capital and
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
general fund expenses continue to
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
Cline so the other two pieces of this
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that I just want to mention
 
01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh that tie into the the uh the bill
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
currently going through the Senate s SP
 
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
549 would be one to clarify that the
 
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
revenue resulting from the sale or
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
transfer to dams as well as other
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue can be deposited in the dam
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund currently the way the
 
01:54:05.709 --> 01:54:05.719 align:start position:0%
statute is written the dam maintenance
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
fund receives funding from the leasing
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
sites one way that we're trying to
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
diminish our revenue is we're actually
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
looking at um selling some of these
 
01:54:17.069 --> 01:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
sites so we have a hydrop power site
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
that's currently going to be going
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
through relicensing uh the hydr power
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
developer that leases that site is
 
01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
actually looking to purchase that site
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
at the open market rate and so we are
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
looking to actually sell that site so we
 
01:54:32.109 --> 01:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the revenue that
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
comes in from the that sale is able to
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
go into this Dam maintenance fund for
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
the repair and reconstruction of
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams the other legislation
 
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
would be to amend RSA 42 Goen
 
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
12 to clarify when it's appropriate for
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
nhds to reclassify Mena
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
stams several years ago uh 42 col2 was
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
created or amended rather so that
 
01:55:00.669 --> 01:55:00.679 align:start position:0%
essentially we had these grandfather
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
non- Mena stams and here in New
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have uh four different
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
Hazard classifications we have the high
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
Hazard that I already spoke about we
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
have significant Hazard low Hazard and
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
non- menace non- menace dams are
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
essentially these dams that are in the
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
middle of nowhere usually privately
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
owned but sometimes publicly owned um in
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
which if they were to fail no one would
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
other than the landowner there's no
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
threat Downstream or anything like that
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
however one thing we found is that some
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
of these dams do pose a threat to
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
Downstream infrastructure and we just
 
01:55:32.669 --> 01:55:32.679 align:start position:0%
want to clarify the language in the
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
current statute so that if that non-
 
01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
Menace Dam cannot discharge the required
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
amount of water to ensure that the
 
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
downstream area is being protected then
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh we would we would go in and
 
01:55:47.229 --> 01:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
reclassify that Dam to make sure it can
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
discharge one one example of this is uh
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
this this summer up in Newport there was
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
a non- Mena Stam in which we looked at
 
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:54.990 align:start position:0%
a non- Mena Stam in which we looked at
in

01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
2019 because of the because of the
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
statute we could not reclassify it
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
however we did at that time observe a
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
downstream driveway and a structure that
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
could have been impacted sure enough in
 
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
July the stam actually failed and took
 
01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
out that Downstream driveway and so
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
we're just looking to clarify this so
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
that way moving forward we hopefully
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't run into these similar issues and
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
so with that um that's all I have today
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll open up for questions
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
I have a
 
01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
question uh Senate Bill
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
549 is that similar to what's being
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
asked in this bill or is that you list
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
made a list of uh of actual action items
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
is that in Senate Bill 549 are those
 
01:56:41.709 --> 01:56:41.719 align:start position:0%
action items occurring yes yes Senate
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 549 already includes those two
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
other action items okay so Senate Bill
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
549 is actually jumped ahead of what
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually doing what
 
01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.069 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually doing what
actually

01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
proposing uh if this is this is a
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
proposing of committee to discover stuff
 
01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
to do Senate Bill 549 is actually doing
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
stuff right proposing it Senate Bill 549
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
is is is very the only difference
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
between that bill and and this bill is
 
01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
that it includes those other two um
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
other two requests to amend the existing
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
statutes okay so it already has so it's
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
actually has has this but it also has
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
other other goodies
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
yes any other questions Representative
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
no Rong yeah Mr chair I did check up and
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
just for you um the information the
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
question you brought up before um Senate
 
01:57:44.669 --> 01:57:44.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 549 has been approved by the senate
 
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
committee it's on the consent calendar
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
for their session
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow good as
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
amended maybe if they release it they'll
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
might even get it before crossover uh
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions by
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you thank you
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representa Point uh thank you
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just to confirm
 
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
so the department um supports um 549 as
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
amended Senate 549 as amended okay thank
 
01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:16.550 align:start position:0%
amended Senate 549 as amended okay thank
you

01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
y representative ho for a question
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
does your uh Authority go to Bieber dams
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
no no these are just just solely
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
man-made structures and the current
 
01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
definition of a dam and statue is any
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
structure over six feet in height
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
there's a couple other nuances but
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
overall it's any man-made structure over
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
six feet in height that's impounding
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
water thank
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Lon question thank
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
question which may be um not really
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
Germain but are there any other
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
classifications besides a menace
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
structures that Dees applies to whether
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
a dam should be rebuilt or not such as
 
01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
populations So currently the way the
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
reclassification process works is a dam
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
is is reviewed by by the dam safety
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
inspector or internally at Dees and
 
01:59:26.589 --> 01:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
really it's a it's a review of potential
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
Downstream impacts that affect life
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
property and economic losses and also in
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
those economic losses you can look at
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
town roads state roads that sort of
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
thing but purely from an ecological
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint they are not
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
reclassified if if that answers your
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
question they're not okay
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
thank any other questions by members of
 
01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:54.350 align:start position:0%
thank any other questions by members of
the

01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
committee one additional thing this is
 
01:59:58.750 --> 01:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
only state owned dams we're not talking
 
02:00:01.229 --> 02:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
about Municipal and not talking about
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
private uh over the years it's been a
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
big deal around privately owned dams uh
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
people wanting to be turned over to the
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
state and the state saying no we can't
 
02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
afford it yeah when we mentioned the dam
 
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund that fund is only used
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
for the repair reconstruction or
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
operation of state-owned
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
dams any other questions representative
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question um
 
02:00:31.629 --> 02:00:31.639 align:start position:0%
representative Herrington actually sort
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
of asked the question I'm
 
02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
just um just want to follow up on what
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative Rulo just asked which is
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
that um I understand that what the
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund is used for as you just
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
described but should the um uh
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
should the commission study um Municipal
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.709 --> 02:00:59.719 align:start position:0%
well it is certainly a an issue for
 
02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
municipal dams and privately owned dams
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you fund these things
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know you you have of course at here
 
02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
at the State of New Hampshire we have
 
02:01:09.149 --> 02:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
our own funding resources that we can
 
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
put into these um however there are
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
plenty of dams that are owned out there
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
by municipalities and there are plenty
 
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
of dams that are owned out there by
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
either Lake Associations or Village
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.629 align:start position:0%
either Lake Associations or Village
districts

02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that all of them are
 
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
struggling of trying to figure out how
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
do we go and fund these these projects
 
02:01:30.189 --> 02:01:30.199 align:start position:0%
obviously when it comes to a municipal
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
owned Dam um there are municipal owned
 
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
dams that are leased out to hydrop power
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
I believe the city of NASA has a couple
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
of those um so but obviously the way
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
they handle things is completely
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
different than how none of none of
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
um none of the rules or regulations or
 
02:01:51.629 --> 02:01:51.639 align:start position:0%
statutes that I'm aware of that apply to
 
02:01:55.069 --> 02:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
how Dees leases out our properties to
 
02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
hydrop power producers apply to any
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
Municipal owned dams or anything of that
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
nature and then um to further answer
 
02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:05.639 align:start position:0%
your question uh the the dams that are
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
owned by either Village districts or
 
02:02:08.669 --> 02:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities that don't have a
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
hydropower entity they are then looking
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
at either the residents of the community
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
or in the village District or they're
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the residents around that
 
02:02:19.629 --> 02:02:19.639 align:start position:0%
that body of water to to come up with
 
02:02:21.790 --> 02:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
the funds necessary to do the repairs
 
02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
and operations and it is always a
 
02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.189 align:start position:0%
and operations and it is always a
challenge

02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
so for a followup thank you Mr chair um
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you again so it sounds like the
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
what you're the recommendation here for
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
this um for this commission is to look
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
at the um the the damn whatever the the
 
02:02:46.030 --> 02:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
state Dam fund and you know how that
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
gets funded for state owned dams and
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a problem with
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities and privately owned dams
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
but you know the stud's got to be sort
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
of constrained that's what you're saying
 
02:02:58.069 --> 02:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I I believe so just just because of
 
02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
the way that funding can be raised to to
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
do this you know the way municipalities
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
can you know with their property taxes
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
and everything else and the way they can
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
raise money is different than how we can
 
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
these any other questions by members of
 
02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:17.550 align:start position:0%
these any other questions by members of
the

02:03:17.550 --> 02:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee is that
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
Point uh do I understand this correctly
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
most of the money that comes in for your
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
operations in the various
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
funds uh their Cash Cow is uh
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric production correct thank
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
you I I will just build upon that we we
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
do also have um seven other accounts
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
that solely are for what we call Project
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
accounts and those are funded through
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
water user agreements which are also
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
tied to hydrop power so for just for an
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
example there is a uh water user
 
02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
agreement for what we call the wiip
 
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
pasak project money that goes into that
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
account is solely to be used for the
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
sites that the state owns within the
 
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
wnab basaki river Lochmere Dam Lakeport
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
Dam that the money gets into that fund
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
by us essentially releasing the water
 
02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
for Downstream hydropower users so those
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
hydrop power users along the winaki
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
river and then the hydrop power users
 
02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
even down within the marac uh amsk
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
Garbin Falls uh hooks it they pay into
 
02:04:32.589 --> 02:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
this water user fund but once again
 
02:04:34.750 --> 02:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
those funds can only be used and even
 
02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
and even only can be used for those
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
particular projects and even in that
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
case we're looking at Capital needs that
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
exceed the amount of money that are in
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
funds representative uh um well do you
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
have Surplus in any of those I think you
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
said seven designated
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
funds very minor Surplus just to make
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not going over in into
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
our not exceeding what's in that Surplus
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
but we we try to keep a a positive
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
balance from year to year on
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
those thank
 
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
you seeing no additional
 
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you

great to be back Mr chairman and uh for
 
03:34:58.110 --> 03:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
the record my name is representative
 
03:34:59.830 --> 03:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
Chuck grassy I representative Rochester
 
03:35:04.469 --> 03:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
W 4 and uh I'm here to introduce HB 1314
 
03:35:06.269 --> 03:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
and before I start with the discussion
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
of the bill I'd like to read something
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
that was written by someone who worked
 
03:35:12.349 --> 03:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
on this with me uh um and basically what
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
she wrote was when when the slogan the
 
03:35:16.349 --> 03:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Advantage was first coined
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
it was linked to our income and sales
 
03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
tax policies our tax policies were
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
important but just as important the
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
Priceless intangibles New Hampshire
 
03:35:26.429 --> 03:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
offers it's incomparable natural beauty
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
its healthy environment the intent of
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is to remember that we are the
 
03:35:32.269 --> 03:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
stewards of our lands and Waters and
 
03:35:34.349 --> 03:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
must balance development and growth and
 
03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
the products of modern society with
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to use protect and
 
03:35:41.309 --> 03:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
treasure our water systems our landscape
 
03:35:43.469 --> 03:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
if we do not identify and counteract
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
threats both natural and man-made if we
 
03:35:47.229 --> 03:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
do not protect the inheritance of our
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
children the New Hampshire are Advantage
 
03:35:50.950 --> 03:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
will become nothing more than an empty
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
and ironic
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
slogan Mr chairman uh when I was growing
 
03:35:56.750 --> 03:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
up a kid I always remember on our
 
03:35:58.269 --> 03:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
license police you say Scenic New
 
03:36:00.750 --> 03:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people came to New Hampshire
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
historically for its beauty they came
 
03:36:04.630 --> 03:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
here for the environment for clean water
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
for the clean for clean air and when we
 
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
looked at the new at the state
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
development plan
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
um what we found is is that nobody was
 
03:36:15.990 --> 03:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the environment as part of
 
03:36:18.550 --> 03:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
our um as as something we should protect
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
as a resource here in the state um the
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
state development plan was basically
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
written back in 2000 and by order of
 
03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
this legislature and they said in the
 
03:36:30.269 --> 03:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
statutes that it should be updated every
 
03:36:33.070 --> 03:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
four years in 2003 they were supposed to
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
start and they did but nothing ever
 
03:36:37.630 --> 03:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
happened became of that when I called
 
03:36:39.150 --> 03:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
legislative services and said could you
 
03:36:40.990 --> 03:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
get me a copy of the state comprehensive
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
development plan they said we can't find
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
it they called me back in 3 days and
 
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
they said we can't find the plan at
 
03:36:49.790 --> 03:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
State Library doesn't even have a copy
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the plan now this is from
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
2000 and I happen to know a planner
 
03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
friend of mine who works for the state
 
03:36:57.870 --> 03:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
and I said did you check in with this
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
person they called him and he said I
 
03:37:01.110 --> 03:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
happen to have one in a box in the
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
bottom of my closet in my office and so
 
03:37:04.830 --> 03:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
now the state has a copy of the state
 
03:37:06.870 --> 03:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
development plan but it goes through and
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
it talks about a number of sections if
 
03:37:11.790 --> 03:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
you take a look at at section n A and B
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the rsas it talks about uh
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
what we need to protect and how we need
 
03:37:19.389 --> 03:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
to manage our resources in the state but
 
03:37:20.830 --> 03:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
it does nothing as far as the
 
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
environment is concerned so what I did
 
03:37:25.429 --> 03:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
is I drafted up a section and working
 
03:37:26.630 --> 03:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
with some other folks up in the Lakes
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
region in particularly uh we drafted out
 
03:37:29.710 --> 03:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
a section and we try to include
 
03:37:32.189 --> 03:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
everything that we looked at as as that
 
03:37:34.269 --> 03:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
we should be protecting in the state of
 
03:37:36.510 --> 03:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as as as far as our
 
03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns our Waters our
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
Lakes our air quality and then we also
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
drafted a section of the development
 
03:37:47.349 --> 03:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
plan dealing with um with threats so
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
that hopefully if this development plan
 
03:37:50.550 --> 03:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
is updated every four years as the RSA
 
03:37:53.429 --> 03:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
say it should be what uh what we'd be
 
03:37:54.990 --> 03:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
looking at is that every four years the
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
state would take on the job of going
 
03:37:59.830 --> 03:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
over what are our what do we have for
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
resources as far as the environment is
 
03:38:03.550 --> 03:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
concerned and what are the threats so
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
every four years it wouldn't be
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
something that we would be reacting to
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
threats to our environment such as Pas
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
but we something that every four years
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
we would be looking for what what
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
threats should we be
 
03:38:16.830 --> 03:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
anticipating in the state of New
 
03:38:18.910 --> 03:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now people have said well this
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
is going to cost a ton of money I'm not
 
03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
looking for any money here and and I
 
03:38:24.710 --> 03:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
really I'm not asking you to do much at
 
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
all what I'm asking you to do is put
 
03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
this in the state development plan if
 
03:38:30.150 --> 03:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature determines the wisdom
 
03:38:32.070 --> 03:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
next year in a budget year that they
 
03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to fund it then basically
 
03:38:35.070 --> 03:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
nothing will be done but it will be in
 
03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:35.750 align:start position:0%
nothing will be done but it will be in
the

03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:38:38.510 --> 03:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
plan so that if a future legislature
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
decides to fund it next year I'll be
 
03:38:42.510 --> 03:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
coming in in a budget year asking that
 
03:38:45.630 --> 03:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
we fund this plan so that we go through
 
03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
and we take a look at all of the factors
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
that are important for for the
 
03:38:50.670 --> 03:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
development of the State of New
 
03:38:52.630 --> 03:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire both economic and
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
environmentally that we when we do take
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
a look at those things um we we we look
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
at the environment because right now if
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
we updated the environmental resources
 
03:39:02.670 --> 03:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
plan we would not be looking at any
 
03:39:04.750 --> 03:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
environmental resources whatsoever but
 
03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
by adding this section and adding a
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
section on threats it would make that
 
03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
happen and I'll be happy to answer any
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
questions we have any questions for the
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you for taking my question um
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
what state agency is responsible for
 
03:39:25.630 --> 03:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
producing the plan well it would be
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
headed up by the um office Planning and
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
Development whatever it's called
 
03:39:30.630 --> 03:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
nowadays because it's changed its names
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
a number of times they would basically
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
head it up and they would work with the
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
particular agencies that would be
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for that if it was something
 
03:39:38.429 --> 03:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
that dealing with environmental issues
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they would be taught working
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
with the folks at d yes um if it was to
 
03:39:44.429 --> 03:39:44.439 align:start position:0%
deal with Industrial Development and
 
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
resources as far as land use for
 
03:39:47.790 --> 03:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
industrial another section of the the
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
plan which currently exist they would
 
03:39:50.910 --> 03:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
look for the the the business and
 
03:39:52.349 --> 03:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
industry Association they would probably
 
03:39:54.030 --> 03:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
work with them to help them develop a
 
03:39:56.510 --> 03:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
plan uh so you they would be able to
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
pull everything together and in the
 
03:40:00.870 --> 03:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
document it talks about that the office
 
03:40:01.870 --> 03:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
of Planning Development has
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility for for doing this thank
 
03:40:07.269 --> 03:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
03:40:07.279 --> 03:40:09.150 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
representative

03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:40:09.160 --> 03:40:11.030 align:start position:0%
representative
celly

03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
celly
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you be for being here
 
03:40:14.670 --> 03:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
representative so um just reading
 
03:40:16.830 --> 03:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
through your proposal the the state has
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
a a 10-year Forest plan that the
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
division of uh Boris and L puts out
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
every year very comprehensive plan so in
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
this type of thing they would you're
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the office would just
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
reach out to them and then take those
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
pieces and plug it right in yeah plans
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of individual plans up
 
03:40:35.309 --> 03:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
here this is a place where the
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislature back in 2000 tried to
 
03:40:40.110 --> 03:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
centralize everything and so what they
 
03:40:41.469 --> 03:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
would do is if there are plans like that
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
they would just pull those into this
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
here so and and be able to update it
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
more frequently and that's what we're
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
hoping to
 
03:40:52.750 --> 03:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
do representative run thank you Mr chair
 
03:40:54.189 --> 03:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative grassy for
 
03:40:56.790 --> 03:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question how do you see this
 
03:40:59.590 --> 03:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
plan um interfacing with local
 
03:41:01.590 --> 03:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh one example I'm
 
03:41:05.550 --> 03:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
thinking of is perhaps in protection of
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Waterway um the this
 
03:41:12.349 --> 03:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
plan might call for expansion of a
 
03:41:15.670 --> 03:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
sewage system that might take over you
 
03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
know across many Town boundaries um how
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
would this plan help coordinate with
 
03:41:22.670 --> 03:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
those different
 
03:41:24.670 --> 03:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
towns well I think that what you'd be
 
03:41:26.349 --> 03:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
looking at here in this plan if it was
 
03:41:28.590 --> 03:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
to develop something which wanted to
 
03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
protect a certain Waterway and there was
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
the advantage to regionalizing uh
 
03:41:35.269 --> 03:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
septics in and we do have some Regional
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
septic facil Wastewater facilities here
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire uh
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
Franklin being one of one of them is
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
that it would give more State impetus to
 
03:41:45.990 --> 03:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
those plans that if we looked at that we
 
03:41:47.670 --> 03:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
need to do more work more regionally and
 
03:41:52.349 --> 03:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
as we know waste water um air quality um
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
contaminants do not recognize Town
 
03:41:56.110 --> 03:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
boundaries uh communities have their
 
03:41:58.389 --> 03:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
Master plans the state has its master
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
plan 2000 was the last time we did a
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
master plan for the State of New
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm looking at that if we
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
update the plan we just have a section
 
03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
that recognizes that the environment is
 
03:42:12.510 --> 03:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
a resource um you know it's it's always
 
03:42:14.790 --> 03:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
been a resource for us and we seem to be
 
03:42:17.790 --> 03:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
looking away from that thank
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
03:42:23.950 --> 03:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative I I have one can you
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
comment on the fiscal note although you
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
say you're not asking for money the
 
03:42:32.710 --> 03:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs state that
 
03:42:35.149 --> 03:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
this may require a third party vendor to
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
help draft the plan with the uh planning
 
03:42:40.149 --> 03:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
and development office and could could
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
cost money for the next year but still
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
it costs money if we put it in the plan
 
03:42:47.070 --> 03:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
it it certainly would would cost some
 
03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
money at some point in time whether it
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
be a third party vendor that they hire
 
03:42:51.389 --> 03:42:51.399 align:start position:0%
to bring in to do this plan or if it's a
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
commission that we have internally uh
 
03:42:55.189 --> 03:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
the state can report ad when this was
 
03:42:57.030 --> 03:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
originally written it was written with
 
03:42:58.269 --> 03:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
the office of planning and development
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
and uh a commission of individuals that
 
03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
represented uh business interest and
 
03:43:06.189 --> 03:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
ended up uh you know and and represented
 
03:43:07.469 --> 03:43:07.479 align:start position:0%
other interests in the state of New
 
03:43:09.950 --> 03:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh resour that represented
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
resources they didn't take into
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
account the environment and that's what
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
I think they you know it was the
 
03:43:18.349 --> 03:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
environment was a secondary thought to
 
03:43:19.710 --> 03:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
everything else they were doing we
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
should have a section that talks about
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
the environment itself so yeah it will
 
03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
cost money to put this plan together and
 
03:43:27.070 --> 03:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
and over this year so I saying I'm not
 
03:43:28.590 --> 03:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
looking us for doing it this year just
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
get it into the plan and then next year
 
03:43:32.550 --> 03:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
I will come in with a budget proposal to
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
actually Implement to do update to the
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
plan thank you no other questions for
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
the representative don't seeing none
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your test thank
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
you our next and last pink card Andrea
 
03:43:52.189 --> 03:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:03.389 --> 03:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
favor right good afternoon I'm Andrea
 
03:44:05.670 --> 03:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
Laro uh president of New Hampshire lakes
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
and it's nice to see you all and uh we
 
03:44:11.469 --> 03:44:11.479 align:start position:0%
are here in support of this bill and I'd
 
03:44:13.510 --> 03:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
like to Echo um all that representative
 
03:44:16.510 --> 03:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
grassy said uh this seems like common
 
03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
sense when we're um coming up with a a
 
03:44:20.429 --> 03:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
plan a development plan for the state
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
that we include the environment and we
 
03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
include a look forward to threats to our
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
environment we know and I know this
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee knows lakes and ponds in
 
03:44:31.990 --> 03:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
particular are so important to the state
 
03:44:35.710 --> 03:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire for so so many reasons
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh you all also know that
 
03:44:41.149 --> 03:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
our lakes and ponds are experiencing
 
03:44:43.189 --> 03:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
some really serious
 
03:44:43.199 --> 03:44:44.750 align:start position:0%
some really serious
degradation

03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
degradation
 
03:44:47.830 --> 03:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
and I would like to think that if we had
 
03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
the environment and a look forward to
 
03:44:52.429 --> 03:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
the risks to the environment in a state
 
03:44:54.750 --> 03:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
a planning process in a planning process
 
03:44:57.870 --> 03:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
that actually um you know continued um I
 
03:44:59.550 --> 03:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
know it's been since 2000 since I've
 
03:45:02.630 --> 03:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
done this document but to every uh four
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
or five years look at the environment
 
03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
how we're developing it um and the
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
threats that we might not be in such a
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
reactive mode I feel like we are in a
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
very reactive mode to what is happening
 
03:45:16.229 --> 03:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
to the health of our Lakes right now and
 
03:45:18.030 --> 03:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
I know this committee has heard a lot
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
about uh toxic
 
03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria um and that's you know a
 
03:45:24.349 --> 03:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
really serious problem that I feel like
 
03:45:26.110 --> 03:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
we're behind the eightball here in New
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it would have been nice to
 
03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to be in a position you know
 
03:45:33.710 --> 03:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago to sort of um
 
03:45:36.189 --> 03:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
take some precautions to to help
 
03:45:38.750 --> 03:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
minimize um this issue that we're
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with and I shutter to think what
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
other risks might be out there um for
 
03:45:45.630 --> 03:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
our lakes that we don't even know about
 
03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm hopeful that inclusion of the
 
03:45:50.070 --> 03:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
environment and threats into a planning
 
03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
process that does actually happen every
 
03:45:54.269 --> 03:45:54.279 align:start position:0%
four or five years will help us better
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
Steward our Lakes uh for cleaner and
 
03:45:58.910 --> 03:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
healthier lakes that again are so so
 
03:46:00.670 --> 03:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
important to our state for so many
 
03:46:02.429 --> 03:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
reasons so I thank you for this
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment and I'd be happy
 
03:46:06.990 --> 03:46:07.000 align:start position:0%

communities along the mar ma River in
 
04:33:10.990 --> 04:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
one um one problem that has caught my
 
04:33:18.670 --> 04:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
eye in the community has been um people
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
who have drowned in the marac rever um
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's something um f first one I
 
04:33:32.830 --> 04:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
can remember um going back to 2013 um 11
 
04:33:37.070 --> 04:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
years ago um already there um there was
 
04:33:39.551 --> 04:33:39.561 align:start position:0%
this guy in my neighborhood we knew um
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
who went by Krabby who um ran into us
 
04:33:45.070 --> 04:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
one fourth of July we were like and we
 
04:33:46.510 --> 04:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
knew he always like to go swimming at
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
the river up at SWS Falls so um we ran
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
to him 1/4th of July and um just talking
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
about how high the river had gone up
 
04:33:59.150 --> 04:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
lately and he's like oh yeah I've been
 
04:34:01.390 --> 04:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
up there watching to make sure people
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
don't drown and um then at turns out in
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
the news the next few days later we find
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
out that he himself had drowned so um I
 
04:34:16.629 --> 04:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
mean yeah people do know that it's
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
dangerous um but um sometimes the
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
resources just aren't there um so there
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
was also um so um there was also some
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
reporting in the Boston Globe um last
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
year 2022 um about how there have been
 
04:34:44.310 --> 04:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
um 31 people have died in the river over
 
04:34:48.590 --> 04:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
the last 12 years um it mentioned some
 
04:34:51.910 --> 04:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
um it mentioned some people who have
 
04:34:54.990 --> 04:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
been doing some advocacy um to try to
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
reduce drings in it um so yeah that made
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
me think of how we could actually um
 
04:35:05.629 --> 04:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
address this from a policy point of view
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
so um that summer uh I actually went and
 
04:35:14.189 --> 04:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
did a survey of the public access sites
 
04:35:17.590 --> 04:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
along the river um basically the places
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
where you can put in your boat or
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
whatever um to see what sort of uh
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
safety features they had um and I took a
 
04:35:31.230 --> 04:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
bunch of pictures um not not really sure
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
what the best way to share them with you
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
all is but um if any of you wants to see
 
04:35:40.869 --> 04:35:40.879 align:start position:0%
them um just let me know um so yeah one
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
of the things I found when doing the
 
04:35:47.551 --> 04:35:47.561 align:start position:0%
survey of um Public Access along the mar
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
ma rever
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
um well all right I'll I'll I'll go in
 
04:35:55.029 --> 04:35:55.039 align:start position:0%
order um one of them some one of them
 
04:35:57.470 --> 04:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
even had a little Memorial to someone
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
who had drowned there at it like that
 
04:36:02.109 --> 04:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
people had just made up on their own
 
04:36:04.029 --> 04:36:04.039 align:start position:0%
initiative um there were a bunch of
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
signs none of them said specifically
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
much of anything um about being careful
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
while swimming though they're mostly um
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
the most of the signs were um about like
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that you don't have invasive
 
04:36:23.590 --> 04:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
um plants stuck here canoe paddles and
 
04:36:26.109 --> 04:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
stuff um
 
04:36:29.869 --> 04:36:29.879 align:start position:0%
so yeah um eventually though at one of
 
04:36:33.510 --> 04:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
the putins um I did find something kind
 
04:36:35.949 --> 04:36:35.959 align:start position:0%
of relevant to what I was looking for at
 
04:36:37.949 --> 04:36:37.959 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:36:41.230 --> 04:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
nhti boat ramp I discovered that there
 
04:36:45.869 --> 04:36:45.879 align:start position:0%
was a life jacket loner station there um
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
and um yeah
 
04:36:53.709 --> 04:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
basically just a sign um and a board
 
04:36:56.470 --> 04:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of life jackets on it that
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
um people
 
04:37:02.189 --> 04:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
could uh that people could borrow when
 
04:37:07.029 --> 04:37:07.039 align:start position:0%
going swimming there to um you know used
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
to keep themselves safe um so I thought
 
04:37:14.230 --> 04:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
oh hey that's a good idea let's um see
 
04:37:14.240 --> 04:37:16.150 align:start position:0%
oh hey that's a good idea let's um see
how

04:37:16.150 --> 04:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
um let's see how we can get more of
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
these distributed um along the river um
 
04:37:27.750 --> 04:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
so I was going to think on it a little
 
04:37:29.629 --> 04:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
while um give it a little bit more
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
thought but then um this summer there
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
was another drowning and that just kind
 
04:37:38.029 --> 04:37:38.039 align:start position:0%
of prompted me to um that just kind of
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
prompted me to hurry with it so I asked
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
OS what they could draft for me um for
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
um the creation of more of these life
 
04:37:52.629 --> 04:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
jacket larer station so um this is the
 
04:37:55.310 --> 04:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
bill they drafted for me um the current
 
04:37:55.320 --> 04:37:56.510 align:start position:0%
bill they drafted for me um the current
ones

04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
ones
 
04:37:56.520 --> 04:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
ones
are

04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:38:01.150 --> 04:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
um mostly done
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah they're um the yeah the current
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
ones are are done by the US Coast Guard
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
um Safe Kids USA um so some federal
 
04:38:14.910 --> 04:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
things and some local things but it's
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
not something that the state of New
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is participating in though so
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
04:38:24.910 --> 04:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
think um yeah also the Children's
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hospital at Dartmouth the city of
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
conquered fire department some boy
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
scouts and nhci also all work together
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
on it so um I think
 
04:38:38.830 --> 04:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
basically um the best thing to do here
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
would be for the State of New Hampshire
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
to help these existing organizations get
 
04:38:47.230 --> 04:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
more of these um set up and basically be
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
involved as a partner with the existing
 
04:38:54.349 --> 04:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
efforts and I hope that this bill um
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
will help make that happen and I'll take
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
questions now does anyone have a
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
Ron thank you Mr Speaker and thank thank
 
04:39:06.869 --> 04:39:06.879 align:start position:0%
you representative Gallagher for taking
 
04:39:09.070 --> 04:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
my question and I really want to commend
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
you for your compassion and empathy for
 
04:39:13.869 --> 04:39:13.879 align:start position:0%
people that are at risk using the Marram
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
River um I have a question though is
 
04:39:17.949 --> 04:39:17.959 align:start position:0%
there anything um that's pre that
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
prevents municipalities from already
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
doing this there may be Public Access
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
within their Town limits that might not
 
04:39:29.789 --> 04:39:29.799 align:start position:0%
have a lot of activity or might have a
 
04:39:31.869 --> 04:39:31.879 align:start position:0%
lot of activity is it something they
 
04:39:35.629 --> 04:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
could take on on their own um I mean
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
yeah municipalities could
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
theoretically um do this themselves but
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
um and yeah this city of conquered fire
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
department was taking part in the nhti
 
04:39:50.590 --> 04:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
one but I mean I'm not on my city
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
council I'm a state representative so
 
04:39:56.110 --> 04:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
this is the Avenue that I have available
 
04:39:58.150 --> 04:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
to me um I do think it's a Statewide
 
04:40:01.070 --> 04:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
issue since the river flows through the
 
04:40:03.948 --> 04:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
entire State um you know people will
 
04:40:03.958 --> 04:40:05.310 align:start position:0%
entire State um you know people will
often

04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
often
 
04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh go through multiple towns when um say
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
canoeing or
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
um or tubing or um boating or some other
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
sort of boating along the river um so I
 
04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
I think it does make sense for the state
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
to be involved in um efforts like this
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Dunn and then
 
04:40:33.190 --> 04:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative white thank you Mr chair
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
why limit it just to the mayac why not
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
making more rivers in New Hampshire um
 
04:40:42.350 --> 04:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
well the marac river is the one that
 
04:40:44.510 --> 04:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
I've primarily heard the most about
 
04:40:47.830 --> 04:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
drownings on um so yeah um biggest
 
04:40:51.628 --> 04:40:51.638 align:start position:0%
rivers in New Hampshire um so yeah
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's also the Connecticut um but that
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
is partially shared with Vermont um and
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
at least from my experience with it is
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
um a lot calmer than the marac like the
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
marac has actual Rapids on it um you
 
04:41:15.510 --> 04:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
know SW Falls even has a um a rating on
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
it a a white waterer rating class um so
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah um then just thinking about the
 
04:41:27.550 --> 04:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
other big river systems um in New
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like the socco flows into main
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly before it gets big enough
 
04:41:34.200 --> 04:41:35.390 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly before it gets big enough
to

04:41:35.390 --> 04:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
um before it gets big enough to really
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
be dangerous and same thing with the
 
04:41:43.628 --> 04:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
Andrew Scoggin so I think the marac is
 
04:41:46.350 --> 04:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
um the Marx's kind of the most important
 
04:41:49.150 --> 04:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
of them just due to the
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
um not its proximity to the centers of
 
04:41:56.150 --> 04:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
population in the state and the um
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
number of people from the state that
 
04:42:01.470 --> 04:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
it representative hoy
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
have you
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
considered uh p uh uh private
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
and public cooperation other words could
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
a um a water ski company by splattering
 
04:42:23.230 --> 04:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
their stuff all over would they Supply
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:42:27.628 --> 04:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
equipment uh at no cost because I you
 
04:42:30.430 --> 04:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
know this is a financial note so um I
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
mean so the wording is the division of
 
04:42:35.708 --> 04:42:35.718 align:start position:0%
State Police Police Department of Safety
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
shall seek funding donations and
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
volunteer assistance in installing and
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
maintaining PFD
 
04:42:45.788 --> 04:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
access um at Public Access sit so yeah I
 
04:42:47.708 --> 04:42:47.718 align:start position:0%
mean I think the wording as it exists
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
does allow for um public private
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
Partnerships of that sort yeah
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
this follow yeah uh I'm working on that
 
04:43:03.150 --> 04:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
so um I think this
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
is that's a good way to get this funded
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
without spending taxpayer money
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
so um and I think that would be
 
04:43:15.310 --> 04:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
possible under the way the bills exist
 
04:43:18.750 --> 04:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:21.070 --> 04:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
existing any other questions
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh Derby thank you Mr
 
04:43:26.030 --> 04:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative I'm trying to understand
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
are you I
 
04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this that this bill um
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
ask the state to work with um
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities and other um private um
 
04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
water owners that um or sorry land
 
04:43:45.270 --> 04:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
owners that provide public access to the
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
water uh to the marac in particular um
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
to set up uh life Jack stations or is
 
04:43:54.750 --> 04:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
this uh restricted to just state-owned
 
04:44:00.590 --> 04:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
um Public Access well um I
 
04:44:00.600 --> 04:44:03.390 align:start position:0%
um Public Access well um I
mean

04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:05.750 align:start position:0%
mean
so

04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
um well all right I'm just going to try
 
04:44:10.550 --> 04:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
to think of the public access sites I
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
reviewed um but like they did already
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
all have some sort of State signage on
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
them already like um the stuff that's
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
required um by law about um like boting
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
regulations and whatever um yeah some of
 
04:44:31.750 --> 04:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
them were near private property but um
 
04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know I think the fact that they are
 
04:44:38.830 --> 04:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
our Public Access sites um already shows
 
04:44:42.190 --> 04:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
that the state already has sort of a
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
claim to them um you know another other
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
thing about the river is it's kind of
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
regarded as a public right of way um for
 
04:44:55.470 --> 04:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
people to travel along um there's
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
actually um what another thing I found
 
04:45:00.990 --> 04:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
besides the public access points was
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
there's uh the state requires Portage
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
trails around
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
the um hydroelectric dams on the uh
 
04:45:11.150 --> 04:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
River and
 
04:45:11.160 --> 04:45:12.868 align:start position:0%
River and
um

04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah there are some of those as well
 
04:45:18.190 --> 04:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
um so I think that kind of shows another
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
way in which the
 
04:45:24.510 --> 04:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
um the river can be seen as a public
 
04:45:26.670 --> 04:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
resource that the state
 
04:45:31.390 --> 04:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:36.070 --> 04:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
on any other questions
 
04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
I have one
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative um have you read the
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note there were at least three
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
major bullet points in it that I thought
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
addressed your bill I don't think from
 
04:45:50.670 --> 04:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony I heard you answer the
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
bullet points have you got an answer to
 
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
the bullet points in the fiscal note
 
04:45:59.788 --> 04:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
like the first one was where are these
 
04:46:01.868 --> 04:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
access points are they on private land
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
not private land um
 
04:46:06.670 --> 04:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
04:46:08.550 --> 04:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
stations I didn't know if you had an
 
04:46:10.628 --> 04:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review it and might have
 
04:46:16.590 --> 04:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
a response um so yeah the um Public
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
Access sites along the river that is
 
04:46:21.670 --> 04:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
something that we actually do have
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
mapped um my my dad actually works for
 
04:46:27.948 --> 04:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
the um office of plan development and
 
04:46:30.190 --> 04:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs and that
 
04:46:31.948 --> 04:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
was one of the things he worked on was
 
04:46:34.350 --> 04:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
mapping the public access sites on all
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
bodies of water within New Hampshire um
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
but the um I
 
04:46:45.310 --> 04:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
mean the um build doesn't
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
specify a specific number of them though
 
04:46:51.070 --> 04:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I
 
04:46:53.590 --> 04:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
think um
 
04:46:57.390 --> 04:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's really basically up to how far
 
04:46:59.230 --> 04:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
the department of safety wants to go
 
04:47:05.070 --> 04:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
with this um and um I I think um
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
we can generally trust the department of
 
04:47:11.788 --> 04:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
safety to um choose a number of sites to
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
put these at that is um both fiscally
 
04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
responsible and um and beneficial to the
 
04:47:20.240 --> 04:47:23.990 align:start position:0%
responsible and um and beneficial to the
public

04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
safety any other questions for the
 
04:47:30.548 --> 04:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you for
 
04:47:33.230 --> 04:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill okay um and yeah I
 
04:47:34.628 --> 04:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
have to actually
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
go back to HHS so thanks for having me

light thank
 
04:48:18.390 --> 04:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
you uh good afternoon everyone for the
 
04:48:21.150 --> 04:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jim eston I work for
 
04:48:23.230 --> 04:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
the injury prevention center at
 
04:48:25.510 --> 04:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health um and also coordinates
 
04:48:28.430 --> 04:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
Safe Kids New Hampshire which is a part
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
of Safe Kids worldwide uh we're one of
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
the the coalitions that are there I have
 
04:48:34.750 --> 04:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
to tell you we're we're really pleased
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
to see HB 1440 come before the committee
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's nice that we'll be able to have an
 
04:48:42.270 --> 04:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
open dialogue about preventing drowning
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and drowning is the
 
04:48:46.190 --> 04:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
fifth leading cause of death for
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
children in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:48:49.948 --> 04:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
for unintentional
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
injury the CDC states that promising
 
04:48:54.910 --> 04:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
drowning prevention strategies include
 
04:48:56.830 --> 04:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
learning basic swimming and water safety
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
skills installing
 
04:49:01.230 --> 04:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
barriers uh closely supervising children
 
04:49:03.628 --> 04:49:03.638 align:start position:0%
at all times when in in when in or near
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
water and wearing life jackets at all
 
04:49:08.510 --> 04:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
times when boating or among weaker
 
04:49:10.948 --> 04:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
swimmers when swimming in natural water
 
04:49:13.070 --> 04:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
settings in New Hampshire most of our
 
04:49:15.788 --> 04:49:15.798 align:start position:0%
drownings occur in non-traditional
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
swimming areas um in other areas of Open
 
04:49:21.628 --> 04:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
Water fatalities are just part of the
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
problem as NE drownings can be
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
devastating to a family as well the
 
04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
darmouth health trauma program has seen
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
six um admissions in The Last 5 Years
 
04:49:33.910 --> 04:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
which I know it doesn't sound like huge
 
04:49:36.510 --> 04:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
huge number but when you think about the
 
04:49:38.750 --> 04:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
brain injury that can result from lack
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
of oxygen over that time it it's a
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money that goes
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
through that I also reached out to
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital they've had three in
 
04:49:50.070 --> 04:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
the last five years and almost 20 in the
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
last since
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
2019 um this is admissions only and does
 
04:49:59.150 --> 04:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
not capture emergency department data
 
04:50:02.470 --> 04:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
nor do I have the EMS Ambulance run data
 
04:50:04.270 --> 04:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire I was
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
working on that but didn't have enough
 
04:50:07.948 --> 04:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
time to get that for you but when I do
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to pass it along the
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
injury prevention center in Safe Kids
 
04:50:13.070 --> 04:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire recommends properly worn
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
and used life jackets as an effective
 
04:50:17.230 --> 04:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
barrier to drowning and near drowning
 
04:50:18.548 --> 04:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
we've worked with our clinical and
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
non-clinical staff at Dartmouth Health
 
04:50:22.270 --> 04:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
CH Dartmouth Health children's to
 
04:50:25.150 --> 04:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
provide over 225 jackets to our most
 
04:50:28.030 --> 04:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and atrisk pediatric patients
 
04:50:29.430 --> 04:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
we have also partnered with 19
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
communities around the state to provide
 
04:50:34.510 --> 04:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
signage and 190 life jackets for laner
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
stations I've attached a photo I I wish
 
04:50:39.310 --> 04:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
I had been able to print it for you in
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
color but um this particular loner
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
station is at um at masoma Lake and
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
Enfield I know that the one you're
 
04:50:49.150 --> 04:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
probably most familiar with actually has
 
04:50:51.910 --> 04:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
a a big board with hooks for the life
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
jackets that that can be uh relatively
 
04:50:56.430 --> 04:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
expensive but this is a pretty
 
04:51:00.270 --> 04:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
costeffective way it's just a um bin
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
that they keep the life jackets in um
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
they also did the same thing the sunnye
 
04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
police department does the same thing at

equipment to those who need the most
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
children in and adults on or near water
 
04:51:26.110 --> 04:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
they can be set up at Waterside

departments or any number of agencies
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be anything special
 
04:51:36.190 --> 04:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
they just need to be
 
04:51:38.350 --> 04:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
accessible in closing I hope you will
 
04:51:39.868 --> 04:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
consider the importance of this bill and
 
04:51:41.310 --> 04:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
how we can work together to make this
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
type of life-saving measure and others
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
available to our citizens I appreciate
 
04:51:48.390 --> 04:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
your time and um please ask any
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have that I can
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%

speaker
 
04:51:57.548 --> 04:51:57.558 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:52:00.030 --> 04:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh could you tell me
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
how many stations you're involved in in
 
04:52:06.190 --> 04:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
terms of these uh uh loner stations we
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
we've provided life jackets to 19 laner
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
stations around the state um two of
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
which are on the marac river um what we
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
what we try to do when we seek out
 
04:52:18.990 --> 04:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
communities is look for
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
organizations um and it it can be a
 
04:52:23.628 --> 04:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
business it can be a uh the police
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
department someplace where there would
 
04:52:27.948 --> 04:52:27.958 align:start position:0%
be access um to the life jackets at
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
least the majority of daylight hours and
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for the town know
 
04:52:37.390 --> 04:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
where their issues are better than I do
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
and so we really rely on them to figure
 
04:52:42.110 --> 04:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
out the best locations to set up those
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
stations follow up follow
 
04:52:47.708 --> 04:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
up who maintain is there a certain
 
04:52:49.510 --> 04:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
quantity that you leave at each station
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
and who maintains the sanitation for
 
04:52:54.990 --> 04:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
these things so that would be the
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
sanitation would be up to the group that
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
takes on the life jackets we provide 10
 
04:53:01.548 --> 04:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
life jackets per Community I will add
 
04:53:04.590 --> 04:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
that um we're willing to work in have uh
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
or will have um enough like life jackets
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
200 for 20 communities in the state of
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 2024 and would love to
 
04:53:14.590 --> 04:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
work with any uh communities that you
 
04:53:18.670 --> 04:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
might identify on the mirac river or
 
04:53:21.070 --> 04:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
not thank
 
04:53:24.510 --> 04:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Darby thank you Mr
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
um what's the funding source that you
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
use for you know buying the life jackets
 
04:53:34.510 --> 04:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
and the you know bins and so forth
 
04:53:36.350 --> 04:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh the
 
04:53:38.430 --> 04:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
funding that we have currently comes
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
from our Chad philan Children's Hospital
 
04:53:43.510 --> 04:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth philanthropy funds um so
 
04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's in the past we've been able to get
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
donations from larger retailers to help
 
04:53:49.628 --> 04:53:49.638 align:start position:0%
out with that that has kind of dried up
 
04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
over the since Co actually um but we are
 
04:53:54.868 --> 04:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
able to work with our fundraisers at
 
04:53:57.510 --> 04:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth to provide this um and and
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll tell you how it all started
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
for us was um one pediatric case near
 
04:54:04.670 --> 04:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
drowning um
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
and out of that case we developed a
 
04:54:08.190 --> 04:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
program to provide not only CPR for the
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
parents but life jackets for kids
 
04:54:14.470 --> 04:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
indeed follow up thank you Mr chair um
 
04:54:15.990 --> 04:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
and what's the the what are the
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs um shrinkage for
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
example you know people maybe that don't
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
return them or that that are damage or
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you know cleaning cleanliness uh
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
types of things what can you comment on
 
04:54:29.310 --> 04:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
that I can it depends on the location I
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
can tell you at the one here in conquer
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
um the first first year we actually
 
04:54:36.910 --> 04:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
ended up with more than we lost um the
 
04:54:38.948 --> 04:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
second year though we we lost a
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
significant number um and that was due
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
to to uh some of the folks along the
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
river that were taking them and selling
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
them um
 
04:54:50.830 --> 04:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
so we we gave some um to conquered fire
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
department again a few uh two years ago
 
04:54:56.708 --> 04:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
in 2022 so that they would have that um
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
you can count
 
04:55:01.470 --> 04:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
on um not just with loss but with damage
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing um losing at
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
least half of those you during the
 
04:55:08.070 --> 04:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
course of the year you're
 
04:55:11.868 --> 04:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
welcome any representative Ron thank you
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:55:17.310 --> 04:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
question um of the drownings which ones
 
04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware of where the person didn't
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
intend to go in the water or um maybe
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
they were close too close to shore let's
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
say with the river and fell in relative
 
04:55:29.030 --> 04:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
to those who deliberately go in the
 
04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
water to go swimming and they just lose
 
04:55:33.470 --> 04:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
control or get injured mhm thank thank
 
04:55:35.788 --> 04:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I'm I don't have
 
04:55:37.510 --> 04:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
any individual cases I don't have that
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
information um I can tell you that um
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
many of our cases especially in the
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
Fring Seasons like spring and fall are
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
due to the cold water and without a life
 
04:55:49.230 --> 04:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
jacket if they have a life jacket it'll
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
give them the time to get to shore
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
without it hypothermia starts to set in
 
04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
and they're weak and and if they're not
 
04:55:57.628 --> 04:55:57.638 align:start position:0%
a strong swimmer to begin with they'll
 
04:55:59.708 --> 04:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
have the issue of not being able to make
 
04:56:04.830 --> 04:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
it so follow up thank you so some of
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
these drownings people may not even
 
04:56:08.910 --> 04:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
recognize that they would need a life
 
04:56:10.628 --> 04:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
jacket because they're not expecting to
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
go in the water so do you see that as a
 
04:56:15.150 --> 04:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
hindrance to getting use because people
 
04:56:17.070 --> 04:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
just say well I'm not going to go in the
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
water I'm going to walk along the river
 
04:56:20.990 --> 04:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to walk on the ice not
 
04:56:22.350 --> 04:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
thinking that they're going to end up in
 
04:56:25.708 --> 04:56:25.718 align:start position:0%
the water so again a great question we
 
04:56:28.030 --> 04:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
recommend that anyone that's out ice
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
fishing is with children um the children
 
04:56:33.470 --> 04:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
have the life jacket on um especially if
 
04:56:34.868 --> 04:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
they're using some type of vehicle to
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
get out on the ice um but you're right I
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
mean if nobody's expecting to go
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
swimming but they drop in in a case like
 
04:56:46.150 --> 04:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
that it certainly wouldn't help them but
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the ones that do know they're going
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
in a boat or on the or near the water
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's a great
 
04:56:57.150 --> 04:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
tool thank you any other questions I got
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
one yes representative Hoy thank
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
you st St
 
04:57:06.190 --> 04:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
statistically how many of these
 
04:57:09.150 --> 04:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
drownings also involved head
 
04:57:11.470 --> 04:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
injury I don't have the statistic on
 
04:57:13.628 --> 04:57:13.638 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry um I'm hoping that my
 
04:57:15.150 --> 04:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
colleague will be able to answer that
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
for you but I can tell you that um the
 
04:57:20.430 --> 04:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
ones that I'm personally familiar with
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
um two out of the three had a head
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
injury um resulting from diving into a
 
04:57:28.000 --> 04:57:29.548 align:start position:0%
injury um resulting from diving into a
log

04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
log
 
04:57:29.558 --> 04:57:31.830 align:start position:0%
log
followup

04:57:31.830 --> 04:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
followup
 
04:57:34.830 --> 04:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
um is it something is it something
 
04:57:37.470 --> 04:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to consider relative
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
to uh headgear safety as well like Cano
 
04:57:42.750 --> 04:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
certainly canoas
 
04:57:45.548 --> 04:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
kayakers probably could end up smashing
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
their head and drowning yeah um right
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
now you know our emphasis is on the life
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%

uh I want to talk to you a little bit
 
04:59:30.788 --> 04:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
about um some statistics and about um
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
our child fatality Review Committee that
 
04:59:37.230 --> 04:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
is within U maternal and child health
 
04:59:40.750 --> 04:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
the department is in support of hb1 1440
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing a life jacket
 
04:59:46.750 --> 04:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
laner station program um along the marac
 
04:59:50.110 --> 04:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
river so as Jim said drowning remains
 
04:59:52.548 --> 04:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
one of the leading causes of preventable
 
04:59:54.670 --> 04:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
death amongst uh children and young
 
04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire um it's the
 
04:59:59.470 --> 04:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
second leading cause of unintentional
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
injury death in children ages 1 through
 
05:00:05.910 --> 05:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
18 years and the third leading cause of
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
unintentional injury death in those
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
under one years of age um between 2017
 
05:00:13.920 --> 05:00:14.868 align:start position:0%
under one years of age um between 2017
and

05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:18.030 --> 05:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
2021 there were approximately 150
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
emergency department visits at New
 
05:00:20.520 --> 05:00:21.628 align:start position:0%
emergency department visits at New
Hampshire

05:00:21.628 --> 05:00:21.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:00:25.070 --> 05:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals um due to near drownings
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
amongst Children and adolescents um uh
 
05:00:32.270 --> 05:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
up to the age of 21 uh 17 of those of
 
05:00:34.430 --> 05:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
the same age age and in the same period
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
were hospitalized and those are the more
 
05:00:40.430 --> 05:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
serious um uh head injuries that uh uh
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
Jim was talking
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
about uh a good portion of the drowning
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
deaths and near drownings that required
 
05:00:49.948 --> 05:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
emergency department visits and
 
05:00:52.990 --> 05:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations in this state uh take
 
05:00:56.190 --> 05:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
place in open bodies of water as opposed
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
to a bathub or um you know someone's
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
private pool um it's well known um as as
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
the representative at the beginning said
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh that the marac um River has been the
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
location of a disproportionate number of
 
05:01:15.628 --> 05:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
um both fatalities and injuries um both
 
05:01:19.548 --> 05:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and New Hampshire um I
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
didn't realize I was doing a little bit
 
05:01:23.430 --> 05:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
more research on the marac it's like one
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
of the most dangerous rivers in the
 
05:01:27.548 --> 05:01:27.558 align:start position:0%
whole country which was um interesting
 
05:01:29.868 --> 05:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
to me in terms of um
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
statistics So within my section um
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
we have oversight over uh New
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's child fatality Review
 
05:01:42.030 --> 05:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
Committee um in accordance with RSA
 
05:01:45.390 --> 05:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
13241 uh its purpose is to conduct
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive multidisciplinary reviews
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
on preventable deaths of children 21 and
 
05:01:54.990 --> 05:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
under um in the state um the executive
 
05:01:57.990 --> 05:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee chooses uh the deaths that we
 
05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
of the child fatality Review Committee
 
05:02:02.830 --> 05:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
chooses those deaths uh based on vital
 
05:02:06.670 --> 05:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
records data um data uh that the state
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
has Hospital data um and our colleagues
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
at the medical examiner office a
 
05:02:14.948 --> 05:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
preventable death is one in which a
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable intervention based on the
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
conditions circumstances or resources
 
05:02:23.070 --> 05:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
available at the time might have
 
05:02:28.110 --> 05:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
prevented the death the real purpose of
 
05:02:32.110 --> 05:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh fatality review committees are to uh
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
determine recommendations and those
 
05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations are medical nature um
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
educational social legal or uh
 
05:02:45.750 --> 05:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
psychological nature they're also policy
 
05:02:47.948 --> 05:02:47.958 align:start position:0%
interventions um it's the intent that
 
05:02:49.868 --> 05:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
the recommendations generated by the
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
committee will have the potential to
 
05:02:54.430 --> 05:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
prevent future deaths and are feasible
 
05:02:56.070 --> 05:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
and evidence
 
05:02:58.750 --> 05:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
informed often these recommendations are
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
centered on community-based prevention
 
05:03:04.270 --> 05:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
efforts um such as the ones uh the life
 
05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
jacket loer stations that my colleague
 
05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
um Mr Esten uh just
 
05:03:12.548 --> 05:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
described um after reviews of drowning
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
deaths in state fiscal year 2020 one of
 
05:03:17.788 --> 05:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
the highlighted recommendations of the
 
05:03:19.830 --> 05:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee was the support for life
 
05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
jacket laner programs particularly those
 
05:03:25.310 --> 05:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
on sites directly adjacent to open
 
05:03:28.868 --> 05:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
bodies of water and often at popular
 
05:03:32.310 --> 05:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
unsupervised recreational locations um
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
which is often the case um in in the
 
05:03:37.150 --> 05:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh the
 
05:03:39.270 --> 05:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations also included Waters
 
05:03:41.150 --> 05:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
that are known for dangerous conditions
 
05:03:43.750 --> 05:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
like the marac um but they're dangerous
 
05:03:46.350 --> 05:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
because of things like depth submerged
 
05:03:49.628 --> 05:03:49.638 align:start position:0%
objects and strong currents um life
 
05:03:51.750 --> 05:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
jackets because of their design and
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
buoyancy are known um and effective
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
deterrence to Drowning by keeping the
 
05:03:59.708 --> 05:03:59.718 align:start position:0%
airway above water when the wearer is in
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
the water the risk of drowning decreas
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
is but as much as 50% when a life jacket
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
is worn so it is a proven Public Health
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
intervention the maternal and child
 
05:04:15.070 --> 05:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
health section also helps to support
 
05:04:18.750 --> 05:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
efforts uh through a contract with um uh
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%

support his salary uh but I do um and he
 
05:04:36.510 --> 05:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
and his colleagues are the uh ta for the
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
life jacket uh laner programs around the
 
05:04:42.750 --> 05:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
state um we fund that through Federal

05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
important part of maternal and child
 
05:05:08.590 --> 05:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
health uh thank you for your support of
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
this very important legislation I'm

happen I'm happy to answer any questions
 
05:05:15.310 --> 05:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
that you may
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
have any questions for the
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
speaker representative
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you m Mr chair and thank you
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is there any
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds available through those
 
05:05:32.190 --> 05:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
Federal lot grants that could help
 
05:05:34.830 --> 05:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
expand this
 
05:05:38.788 --> 05:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
program so um the title five black Grant
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
interesting fact is uh the oldest uh
 
05:05:43.390 --> 05:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health Grant in the United States
 
05:05:43.400 --> 05:05:44.590 align:start position:0%
Public Health Grant in the United States
since

05:05:44.590 --> 05:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:05:47.470 --> 05:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
1935 um it's allocated to every state
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
and territory based on the number of
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
children um living in poverty so New
 
05:05:57.628 --> 05:05:57.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually gets less than many
 
05:06:02.670 --> 05:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
of its um surrounding uh States um that
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
number varies very little over the years
 
05:06:09.788 --> 05:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
um uh it's actually gone down uh within
 
05:06:14.990 --> 05:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years I'd say uh we are will
 
05:06:18.670 --> 05:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
be currently or we will be entering into
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
A needs assessment year where we're
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to we meaning maternal and child
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
health uh will be doing A needs
 
05:06:28.430 --> 05:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
assessment of um the state's priorities
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
with respect to um uh moms and kids and
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
so uh injury prevention has always been
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
in children has always been a uh
 
05:06:44.670 --> 05:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
priority for us uh hopefully we'll we'll
 
05:06:46.910 --> 05:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
see again for uh
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
2025 so the the funding is determined uh
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know by how much we have um our
 
05:06:53.280 --> 05:06:54.150 align:start position:0%
you know by how much we have um our
other

05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:06:58.150 --> 05:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
contractors uh it's a complicated yeah
 
05:06:59.948 --> 05:06:59.958 align:start position:0%
and it's like Jim said you know there
 
05:07:05.670 --> 05:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
are um uh Safe Kids us say uh has uh uh
 
05:07:07.590 --> 05:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
some funding but there is limited
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
funding with respect to uh uh drowning
 
05:07:14.350 --> 05:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
prevention what' you say at this point
 
05:07:16.270 --> 05:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
at this point in time yeah in injury
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
prevention in general there is
 
05:07:22.750 --> 05:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
so does that did I answer your question
 
05:07:26.350 --> 05:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Derby thank you Mr
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
um if I understood you correctly um
 
05:07:35.708 --> 05:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
you're you evaluate um you know injury
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
death prevention for um you children and
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
maternal Health across a wide variety of
 
05:07:43.990 --> 05:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
different areas um yes are there can you
 
05:07:49.150 --> 05:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
think of any analogies where um where
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
you have work where the maybe the
 
05:07:54.750 --> 05:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
department has worked with um privately
 
05:08:00.350 --> 05:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
funded um let's say uh um um privately
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
funded sources um for
 
05:08:05.230 --> 05:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
you know for uh
 
05:08:08.190 --> 05:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
donations uh to support support those
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
programs rather than coming to the state
 
05:08:13.470 --> 05:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
or coming to the federal
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
government um so I'm thinking of um so a
 
05:08:20.830 --> 05:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
life jacket is is like a device right so
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of other devices that um
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
that so like a car passenger safety seat
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
right so um uh I know that New Hampshire
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
gets money through the office of Highway
 
05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
Safety with the Department of Safety
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
Federal funding for child passenger
 
05:08:39.868 --> 05:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
safety at Jim's shop um to purchase car
 
05:08:44.910 --> 05:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
seats uh a car seat fitting events um
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
that also is funded by thing you know
 
05:08:49.868 --> 05:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
back in the day Jim and I would do car
 
05:08:53.548 --> 05:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
seat um fittings at um uh toys or us
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
right so like a a so yes there are um uh
 
05:09:01.708 --> 05:09:01.718 align:start position:0%
other uh sort of evidence not evidence
 
05:09:05.510 --> 05:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
but viice um type of interventions that
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
um are are have been funded and are
 
05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:17.948 --> 05:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
uh that was that also did that answer
 
05:09:20.830 --> 05:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
your question follow thank you for the
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair um so does the
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
department um directly engage DHHS
 
05:09:28.868 --> 05:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
directly engage with these private
 
05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
entities to solicit donations that way
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
so so so no it's very difficult um as
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
you know to uh uh there's a process for
 
05:09:41.590 --> 05:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
accepting State funding so we accept uh
 
05:09:43.868 --> 05:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
we go for and accept Federal funding
 
05:09:46.590 --> 05:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
that's a long process um that includes
 
05:09:49.230 --> 05:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh fiscal committee approval GNC
 
05:09:54.270 --> 05:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
approval etc etc um it is rare that um
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
and I'm not even sure if I know of a of
 
05:09:59.230 --> 05:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
a I'd have to get back to you about we
 
05:10:01.510 --> 05:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have uh never accepted uh private
 
05:10:04.990 --> 05:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation funding however um our
 
05:10:06.990 --> 05:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues do none of the work that we
 
05:10:11.628 --> 05:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
do um uh within MCH or public health uh
 
05:10:15.150 --> 05:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
is within ourselves so uh many times we
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
work with community- based organizations
 
05:10:18.910 --> 05:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
we know practically all of them in the
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
state um and then help them to uh um uh
 
05:10:26.670 --> 05:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
like kind of like uh Chad you know
 
05:10:28.510 --> 05:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
Children's Hospital artment to seek
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
donations for a specific uh
 
05:10:31.040 --> 05:10:34.590 align:start position:0%
donations for a specific uh
project

05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative rang thank you Mr chair
 
05:10:39.310 --> 05:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
during your testimony you had said
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
something that was said by previous
 
05:10:46.310 --> 05:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
speakers about 31 deaths along the maram
 
05:10:48.350 --> 05:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
river you said that also included
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so I'm wondering how many
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
of those deaths were in Massachusetts
 
05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
how many in New Hampshire and of those
 
05:10:58.030 --> 05:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
how many were children I would have to
 
05:11:00.750 --> 05:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
get back to you with that question okay
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
and then followup and um as far as the
 
05:11:08.350 --> 05:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
the what I'm hearing you saying is that
 
05:11:10.270 --> 05:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
your your work is really focused on
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
saving children and thank you very much
 
05:11:15.670 --> 05:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
for that but the life jacket program is
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
that all children size life Jack no no
 
05:11:22.110 --> 05:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
no um and Jim I think you have a variety
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
of different sizes do you want to come
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
fine I don't think that there are any
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
life uh jacket laner programs that you
 
05:11:38.990 --> 05:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
have that have just um children sizes no
 
05:11:41.470 --> 05:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
we provide one infant um and they're the
 
05:11:45.788 --> 05:11:45.798 align:start position:0%
most expensive we provide um two 30 to
 
05:11:49.868 --> 05:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
50 pound life jackets two 50 to 90 pound
 
05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
life jackets um two extra small Smalls
 
05:11:57.510 --> 05:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
and then two uh large medium larges and
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
then one extra large so we're trying to
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
cover um
 
05:12:04.670 --> 05:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
we we know everyone's vulnerable the
 
05:12:06.350 --> 05:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
children are the most vulnerable we have
 
05:12:08.590 --> 05:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
five for the children but we also have
 
05:12:10.910 --> 05:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
bigger kids that don't fit into the
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
smaller ones so they have to use you
 
05:12:14.190 --> 05:12:14.200 align:start position:0%
know extra small small or something but
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
use representative
 
05:12:22.590 --> 05:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
wealth thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:12:26.350 --> 05:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions um is it your
 
05:12:28.670 --> 05:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
expectation that somebody would use
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
these if they're walking along the edge
 
05:12:34.030 --> 05:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
of the river or are they a uh an
 
05:12:34.040 --> 05:12:37.470 align:start position:0%
of the river or are they a uh an
emergency

05:12:37.470 --> 05:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
PFT uh well I think uh uh Jim uh talked
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
about uh Safety near the river it's our
 
05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
expectation that if people needed them
 
05:12:50.430 --> 05:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
and they did not have them that they
 
05:12:52.270 --> 05:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
would use them when going on the river
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
or when in the river it's my experience
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
that um the uh fatalities uh injuries
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
and um uh that are Hospital ized and
 
05:13:04.990 --> 05:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
emergency department visits are those uh
 
05:13:06.510 --> 05:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
and I know you had asked a question
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
earlier about um in the river versus or
 
05:13:13.030 --> 05:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
in a body of water versus um uh just
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
going alongside the water right and and
 
05:13:18.270 --> 05:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
most of those are in within the body of
 
05:13:18.280 --> 05:13:22.670 align:start position:0%
most of those are in within the body of
water

05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:22.680 --> 05:13:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:29.470 --> 05:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
okay I mean New Hampshire has a law for
 
05:13:33.030 --> 05:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know for boating for for kids um uh
 
05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
which the Marine Patrol does a really
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
great job of
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
enforcing and you know not for adults
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:44.638 --> 05:13:46.350 align:start position:0%
 
Children

05:13:46.350 --> 05:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
Children
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
followup so your expectation is that
 
05:13:49.680 --> 05:13:50.708 align:start position:0%
followup so your expectation is that
somebody

05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:13:53.110 --> 05:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's recreating on the edge of the
 
05:13:55.150 --> 05:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
river would come and take one of these
 
05:13:58.788 --> 05:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
out of the box use it and then return it
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
assuming that they didn't slept in the
 
05:14:02.830 --> 05:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
rofer or something um
 
05:14:05.070 --> 05:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
it would be our hope that if there was a
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
laner program there that uh yes they
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
they could uh take it and and use it and
 
05:14:15.390 --> 05:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
I think as Mr um Esten uh explained you
 
05:14:18.590 --> 05:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
know uh the issue was with you know
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
people bringing it back but um but if if
 
05:14:25.708 --> 05:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
uh they do not have one then um
 
05:14:27.868 --> 05:14:27.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
05:14:32.788 --> 05:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your

um I'm representative cat McGee and from
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 35 which is Hollis and I thank
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
you for consideration of 1483 today a
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
bill allowing local regulation of water
 
05:33:06.788 --> 05:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
supply concerning
 
05:33:08.788 --> 05:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
subdivisions I'd like to give you just a
 
05:33:11.470 --> 05:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
brief history of how this bill came
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
about and also describe my perspective
 
05:33:16.708 --> 05:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
on the problem the bill aims to
 
05:33:19.390 --> 05:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
fix as you can see from the sponsor list
 
05:33:21.948 --> 05:33:21.958 align:start position:0%
before you the bill is a bipartisan
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
effort two years ago a constituent in
 
05:33:27.548 --> 05:33:27.558 align:start position:0%
Hollis at the transfer station uh
 
05:33:30.030 --> 05:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
decided to tell me his major concern
 
05:33:33.350 --> 05:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
with development going on in our town uh
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
and in general and he said water is a
 
05:33:38.110 --> 05:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
precious resource resource and we take
 
05:33:41.150 --> 05:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
it for granted when uh development goes
 
05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
in there is very little consideration
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
given to the impact of that new series
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
of uh private Wells on local water
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
supply and any potential adverse effects
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
to surrounding even Downstream if you
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
will existing
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
homes I took my constituents concerns to
 
05:34:02.350 --> 05:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
heart and as a member of my local zoning
 
05:34:04.430 --> 05:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
board I did a little digging with the
 
05:34:07.548 --> 05:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
town planner and talked with Dees water
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
folks and tried to figure out an
 
05:34:12.310 --> 05:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate legislative
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
response as you know many bills do not
 
05:34:17.670 --> 05:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
make it through on the first uh attempt
 
05:34:19.150 --> 05:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
through the legislative
 
05:34:21.548 --> 05:34:21.558 align:start position:0%
Gauntlet uh and this bill was no
 
05:34:24.030 --> 05:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
exception to that uh what you have
 
05:34:27.470 --> 05:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
before you today is a revised version of
 
05:34:30.670 --> 05:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
last year's HB 310 which required
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
developers of subdivisions of over four
 
05:34:36.510 --> 05:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
houses to provide a hydrology study for
 
05:34:38.948 --> 05:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
water adequacy and
 
05:34:42.310 --> 05:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
portability there were many eyes on HB
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
310 and that resulted in some very good
 
05:34:47.868 --> 05:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
input I was on medical leave when the
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
bill was actually heard and it was ited
 
05:34:53.548 --> 05:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
at that time so this is the improved
 
05:34:55.948 --> 05:34:55.958 align:start position:0%
version which seeks to protect home
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
buyers and municipalities from
 
05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
supporting Housing Development that does
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
not adequately consider the critical
 
05:35:05.750 --> 05:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
needs of water uh right at the
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
outset the bill um exempts Community
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
water systems and large groundwater
 
05:35:13.750 --> 05:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawals because the prior version
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
was too broad in that regard in this
 
05:35:19.390 --> 05:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
bill we put the ownership on local
 
05:35:21.390 --> 05:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning rather than trying
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
to mandate a one-size fits-all approach
 
05:35:26.548 --> 05:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
but we want to change the L we wanted to
 
05:35:29.110 --> 05:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
change the language in order to bring a
 
05:35:33.510 --> 05:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
focus to water as an essential aspect of
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
housing just as we cannot sell a house
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
without a septic permit local planners
 
05:35:41.788 --> 05:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
should be able to require that housing
 
05:35:44.830 --> 05:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
is not being built without adequate or
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
usable Water Supplies this bill ensures
 
05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
that a resource that receives cursory
 
05:35:53.948 --> 05:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
consideration be elevated to a greater
 
05:35:57.350 --> 05:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and uh at the very time when we
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
are being asked to rapidly build more
 
05:36:02.590 --> 05:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
housing stock hb1
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
1483 asks planning boards to prescribe
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
minimum on lot private well testing
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
requirements to assure adequate water
 
05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
supply for subdivisions as defined in
 
05:36:17.150 --> 05:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 674 colon
 
05:36:20.470 --> 05:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
362 this assures that there is Clarity
 
05:36:22.110 --> 05:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
between the municipality and the
 
05:36:24.628 --> 05:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
developer at the outset of what is
 
05:36:27.670 --> 05:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
needed um to support new
 
05:36:30.190 --> 05:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
builds with adequate water
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
and minimum disruption to existing
 
05:36:35.070 --> 05:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
Neighbors on private Wells I think my
 
05:36:40.830 --> 05:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
constituent was spoton in bringing uh um
 
05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
I lost my place in bringing this to to
 
05:36:45.310 --> 05:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
our attention homeowners and home buyers
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
deserve the peace of mind this
 
05:36:49.868 --> 05:36:49.878 align:start position:0%
legislation can provide experienced
 
05:36:52.948 --> 05:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
legislators know that you cannot fix
 
05:36:56.070 --> 05:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
every situation with a change in statute
 
05:36:58.350 --> 05:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
but this is an area where we can improve
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
the focus on water in building
 
05:37:03.350 --> 05:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions finally the bill language
 
05:37:05.548 --> 05:37:05.558 align:start position:0%
includes the ability of the planning
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
board to assess the costs of notice to
 
05:37:11.470 --> 05:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
abutters and administrative expenses to
 
05:37:12.910 --> 05:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
the developer for meeting this
 
05:37:15.270 --> 05:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
requirement at their discretion which
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
helps fund the local control piece of
 
05:37:21.030 --> 05:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
what we uh used to call a warranty of
 
05:37:21.040 --> 05:37:22.510 align:start position:0%
what we uh used to call a warranty of
mercant

05:37:22.510 --> 05:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
mercant
 
05:37:22.520 --> 05:37:24.030 align:start position:0%
mercant
tability

05:37:24.030 --> 05:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
tability
 
05:37:25.830 --> 05:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
um as
 
05:37:29.070 --> 05:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
your uh it's as close as to a warranty
 
05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
of Mer ability as you're going to get um
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
so people will be able to understand
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
that they're going to get what they're
 
05:37:39.070 --> 05:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
paying for and um if you build a a
 
05:37:41.430 --> 05:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of houses and then owners
 
05:37:43.708 --> 05:37:43.718 align:start position:0%
find out that they have to limit their
 
05:37:46.510 --> 05:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
water use to certain hours of the day or
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
the quality of the water is such that
 
05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
they have to mitigate it to use it
 
05:37:52.948 --> 05:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
somebody's really been sold a lemon so I
 
05:37:55.430 --> 05:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
believe that the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:37:58.990 --> 05:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
Association and also the um Department
 
05:38:00.868 --> 05:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
of environment Services Water Division
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
are going to be speaking on behalf of
 
05:38:05.470 --> 05:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
the bill as well um and I just want to
 
05:38:08.110 --> 05:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
explain also that this bill comes back
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
to you as enabling legislation so it's
 
05:38:13.708 --> 05:38:13.718 align:start position:0%
it's helping local municipalities to be
 
05:38:16.948 --> 05:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
able to focus on this issue with the
 
05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
change in the statute but it doesn't
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
require them to do anything specifically
 
05:38:23.390 --> 05:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
so what it's doing is really trying to
 
05:38:25.590 --> 05:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
elevate the issue so that they have a
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
tool in their hand when a developer
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
comes in and and goes to goes to build
 
05:38:33.548 --> 05:38:33.558 align:start position:0%
build uh a subdivision that's
 
05:38:36.548 --> 05:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
it take questions I'm happy to take
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
questions yes are there any questions
 
05:38:40.670 --> 05:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
for the prime
 
05:38:42.750 --> 05:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative
 
05:38:45.150 --> 05:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
run thank you very much Mr chair and
 
05:38:46.910 --> 05:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
05:38:49.670 --> 05:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
question I remember my first term in the
 
05:38:51.750 --> 05:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
house we had a bill I believe
 
05:38:53.830 --> 05:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative Hobson who was on the
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
committee had sponsored it regarding
 
05:38:57.788 --> 05:38:57.798 align:start position:0%
this issue and then I remember we
 
05:39:00.230 --> 05:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
hearing our your bill last um time so
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
I'm really glad that you address some of
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
the issues where this is putting more of
 
05:39:07.628 --> 05:39:07.638 align:start position:0%
the um responsibility I guess on the
 
05:39:09.030 --> 05:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
town their municipality and their
 
05:39:10.830 --> 05:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
planning board have you had discussions
 
05:39:12.750 --> 05:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
with the planning board in Hollis or
 
05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
anybody in that realm to see what they
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
think of this I have I I mean our town
 
05:39:20.190 --> 05:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
planner Kevin Anderson is the really um
 
05:39:23.070 --> 05:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
was the point person and he also attends
 
05:39:24.548 --> 05:39:24.558 align:start position:0%
the zoning board meetings and I'm on the
 
05:39:26.190 --> 05:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
zoning board so I made the zoning board
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
aware and the chair of the zone this
 
05:39:31.590 --> 05:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
chair of the planning board is also on
 
05:39:33.510 --> 05:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
the zoning board so I've actually talked
 
05:39:35.310 --> 05:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
to quite a few people that this would
 
05:39:37.230 --> 05:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
affect in my town and they're all in
 
05:39:39.708 --> 05:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
favor of it they think it's a good idea
 
05:39:43.628 --> 05:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
thank y thank you any other
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:49.830 --> 05:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
montain thank you thank you for taking
 
05:39:52.030 --> 05:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
my question so just to be clear I'm sort
 
05:39:53.310 --> 05:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
of remembering
 
05:39:57.390 --> 05:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
h310 um so you remove the hydrology
 
05:39:59.468 --> 05:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
specifically like having to do that
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
study um yeah I mean it was considered a
 
05:40:04.548 --> 05:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
mandate because the way it was written
 
05:40:07.788 --> 05:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
it would require it and depending on the
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
project um and depending on the planning
 
05:40:14.150 --> 05:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
board a hydrology study may or may not
 
05:40:18.110 --> 05:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
be part of that project and so it was um
 
05:40:20.350 --> 05:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
deemed as not necessary to be put into
 
05:40:20.360 --> 05:40:21.910 align:start position:0%
deemed as not necessary to be put into
the

05:40:21.910 --> 05:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:25.708 --> 05:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
statute and follow up so y sure so
 
05:40:27.788 --> 05:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
you're just trying to keep the the
 
05:40:31.030 --> 05:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
wording um minimum on lot private well
 
05:40:33.070 --> 05:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
testing requirements to
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
be um do you care to elaborate on what
 
05:40:40.628 --> 05:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
you think that might be yes I I think
 
05:40:42.510 --> 05:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
when folks go to build an individual
 
05:40:45.070 --> 05:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
house you have perk testing so you and
 
05:40:47.788 --> 05:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
you know so you determine whether or not
 
05:40:50.110 --> 05:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
you are have suitable amount of water to
 
05:40:54.390 --> 05:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
support a well this is um an attempt to
 
05:40:57.070 --> 05:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
put into the statute language that would
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
allow those people who are responsible
 
05:41:01.190 --> 05:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
for planning when a subdivision is going
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
in so more houses than one house to look
 
05:41:07.708 --> 05:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
at it in an overall way and so the idea
 
05:41:11.070 --> 05:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
is just to um support that in the
 
05:41:13.628 --> 05:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
language and um because it hasn't been
 
05:41:16.230 --> 05:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
supported in the past in the statutory
 
05:41:18.510 --> 05:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
language so we have the individual perk
 
05:41:21.070 --> 05:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
test for an individual home and then we
 
05:41:24.110 --> 05:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
have an expensive hydrology report which
 
05:41:26.750 --> 05:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
isn't required but can be done if you
 
05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
think that there may be issues this is
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
sort of serving that interim situation
 
05:41:35.868 --> 05:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
where you now have it elevated so that
 
05:41:40.468 --> 05:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
it should be looked at in terms of um uh
 
05:41:42.628 --> 05:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
sort of proofs that you can bring back
 
05:41:45.230 --> 05:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
to the Planters in the town that uh
 
05:41:46.670 --> 05:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's going to be adequate water for
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
not only the houses you're putting in
 
05:41:50.030 --> 05:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
but also for the surrounding private
 
05:41:52.030 --> 05:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
Wells because that has been an issue in
 
05:41:53.468 --> 05:41:53.478 align:start position:0%
some of the subdivisions that have been
 
05:41:56.110 --> 05:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
put in that as we were doing research
 
05:41:57.670 --> 05:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that came to
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
light is that water is starting to
 
05:42:03.868 --> 05:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
become an issue um that needs greater
 
05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
scrutiny I think it's also a very
 
05:42:10.990 --> 05:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
difficult issue to solve or to address
 
05:42:13.150 --> 05:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
through legislation and so I saw the
 
05:42:15.430 --> 05:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
letter that came from from water
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
services at Dees saying that there was a
 
05:42:22.468 --> 05:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
a Water Commission in '08 that put out a
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
report in 2010 and they uh came to some
 
05:42:28.750 --> 05:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
similar conclusions that there ought to
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
be something something additional at the
 
05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
municipal level but they didn't follow
 
05:42:34.270 --> 05:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
through with legislation that actually
 
05:42:36.708 --> 05:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
got there and I was happy to see the
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
letter said that they felt that this
 
05:42:40.270 --> 05:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
bill was consistent with what they were
 
05:42:42.830 --> 05:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get at so I I really just see
 
05:42:45.270 --> 05:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
it as enabling rather than
 
05:42:47.628 --> 05:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
mandating thank you you're
 
05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
welcome sentive Derby thank you Mr chair
 
05:42:52.788 --> 05:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
05:42:54.868 --> 05:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry for the redundant
 
05:42:55.948 --> 05:42:55.958 align:start position:0%
question here but I just want to make
 
05:42:59.430 --> 05:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
sure I get this you're talking about um
 
05:43:01.190 --> 05:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
subdivisions where there's going to be
 
05:43:04.270 --> 05:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
basically uh Wells per home as opposed
 
05:43:06.750 --> 05:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
to some kind of um water source that's
 
05:43:08.468 --> 05:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
shared by all the homes in the
 
05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
subdivision that's what you're trying to
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
enable allow the municipalities to sort
 
05:43:17.390 --> 05:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
of monitor the water impact of I think
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I think
 
05:43:24.830 --> 05:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
that uh in my town the majority of
 
05:43:27.350 --> 05:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that have been put in have
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
not had um um have not had water sources
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
sized for the entire group of buildings
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
they've been individual Wells and I
 
05:43:38.910 --> 05:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
think that happens in many towns in New
 
05:43:43.788 --> 05:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um this doesn't specify
 
05:43:46.708 --> 05:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
um that either of those is exclusionary
 
05:43:48.430 --> 05:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
to the other in other words it doesn't
 
05:43:49.708 --> 05:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
matter what type of system you're
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
putting in if you're putting in houses
 
05:43:55.468 --> 05:43:55.478 align:start position:0%
then you um have to basically show that
 
05:43:57.628 --> 05:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
there's adequate Supply so I I don't
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
think it's about individual Wells or
 
05:44:03.468 --> 05:44:03.478 align:start position:0%
Collective Wells I know we do have some
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
housing um we have some senior housing
 
05:44:09.150 --> 05:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
where uh I got a call on Thanksgiving
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
that they were out of water and it's
 
05:44:13.110 --> 05:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
happened more than once you know so it
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
it would cover that type of a situation
 
05:44:17.230 --> 05:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
as well where there was a well that was
 
05:44:20.830 --> 05:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
being used by multiple uh residences in
 
05:44:23.628 --> 05:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
a building or buildings so it doesn't
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
specify specifically so that it can be
 
05:44:28.628 --> 05:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
applied to different types of uh
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
projects Pro s you're welcome any other
 
05:44:38.310 --> 05:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
questions I I have a question the last
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the bill talks about
 
05:44:44.910 --> 05:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
planning boards charging notification
 
05:44:48.510 --> 05:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
fees and other fees to the
 
05:44:51.628 --> 05:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
applicant I I could be mistaken but I
 
05:44:54.830 --> 05:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
believe in my town could could you not
 
05:44:56.590 --> 05:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
under the current
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
statutes uh include the notification fee
 
05:45:04.270 --> 05:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
and your filing fee and then regarding
 
05:45:06.670 --> 05:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
the other
 
05:45:09.708 --> 05:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
testing I know that my town makes the
 
05:45:12.990 --> 05:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
applicant pay for a t a town review by
 
05:45:16.830 --> 05:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
its engineer so could they not now under
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
carrent law ask them to do a water test
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
and submit it thank you that's it's a
 
05:45:25.150 --> 05:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
good very good question I believe and
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
maybe someone else can um can speak to
 
05:45:30.190 --> 05:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
this I believe that this language was
 
05:45:33.270 --> 05:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
added to this uh section of the
 
05:45:36.190 --> 05:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
statute so it would apply specifically
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
to this process um I I uh am aware
 
05:45:46.190 --> 05:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
that uh applicants are required to cover
 
05:45:48.468 --> 05:45:48.478 align:start position:0%
a butter notifications on the zoning
 
05:45:50.110 --> 05:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
board I've been on the zoning board for
 
05:45:53.070 --> 05:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
years so that is true um I'm sure there
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
is a statute that already covers that
 
05:45:57.750 --> 05:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
but I think the additional language
 
05:45:59.708 --> 05:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
around providing assessment of
 
05:46:02.070 --> 05:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable fees to cover the board's
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses and costs of
 
05:46:04.440 --> 05:46:05.468 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses and costs of
special

05:46:05.468 --> 05:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
special
 
05:46:05.478 --> 05:46:07.110 align:start position:0%
special
investigation

05:46:07.110 --> 05:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
05:46:10.110 --> 05:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
again I think they wanted the the
 
05:46:12.390 --> 05:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
language reiterated to go along with
 
05:46:12.400 --> 05:46:13.150 align:start position:0%
language reiterated to go along with
this

05:46:13.150 --> 05:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:46:16.230 --> 05:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
statute um so that when this was what
 
05:46:18.270 --> 05:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
you were undertaking this piece of it
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
you would be able to recover those fees
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
they wanted it to be explicit I guess
 
05:46:25.830 --> 05:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
rather than uh implicit so that's the
 
05:46:27.390 --> 05:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
best I can answer that I'm not really
 
05:46:31.030 --> 05:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
sure I think you can probably you can
 
05:46:32.510 --> 05:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably charge people for those
 
05:46:35.628 --> 05:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
administrative fees or engineering fees
 
05:46:38.110 --> 05:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
um but I think they just wanted it to go
 
05:46:40.190 --> 05:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
along with with the language for this
 
05:46:43.150 --> 05:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
particular section thank you any other
 
05:46:46.230 --> 05:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
questions for the prime sponsor seeing
 
05:46:48.070 --> 05:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
none thank you thank you appreciate you
 
05:46:48.080 --> 05:46:49.110 align:start position:0%
none thank you thank you appreciate you
being

05:46:49.110 --> 05:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
here uh I have a pink card uh from
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:47:18.468 align:start position:0%
 
Dees

05:47:18.468 --> 05:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:19.788 --> 05:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Brandon kernin
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
administrator of the drinking water and
 
05:47:23.070 --> 05:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau at
 
05:47:27.670 --> 05:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
Dees um our agency at this point is
 
05:47:30.628 --> 05:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
notes at HB 1483 is not proposing the
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
change the statutes relative to anything
 
05:47:36.190 --> 05:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
that Dees regulates nor does it propose
 
05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
to re regulate and overlap with anything
 
05:47:40.868 --> 05:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
we regulate like Community water systems
 
05:47:43.548 --> 05:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
or large groundw withdrawals and because
 
05:47:45.548 --> 05:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
the bill is focused on municipal
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
authorities were not taking a position
 
05:47:49.230 --> 05:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
on the bill but I would like to provide
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
some information very quickly on it um
 
05:47:53.468 --> 05:47:53.478 align:start position:0%
this bill would clarify that
 
05:47:55.230 --> 05:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities can address the adequacy
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
of water supply when they're looking at
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
a proposed subdivision um some
 
05:48:00.590 --> 05:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities have done this already
 
05:48:02.270 --> 05:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
under existing statute but this would
 
05:48:03.948 --> 05:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
make it explicit really clear that
 
05:48:05.788 --> 05:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities may do this if they want
 
05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
to they don't have to when they look at
 
05:48:07.280 --> 05:48:08.628 align:start position:0%
to they don't have to when they look at
a

05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:48:10.990 --> 05:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
subdivision um and it also makes it
 
05:48:13.030 --> 05:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
clear that it won't interfere with our
 
05:48:14.750 --> 05:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
assessment of adequacy of water supply
 
05:48:16.110 --> 05:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
when we look at it for large groundwater
 
05:48:18.750 --> 05:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
draws and Community water systems and so
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
we think that's a really good aspect of
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
the bill essentially what this bill is
 
05:48:23.548 --> 05:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
doing it's allowing municipalities to
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
look at the adequacy of water supply
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
where Dees is not right now and so some
 
05:48:30.070 --> 05:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
degree that makes a lot of sense as the
 
05:48:31.830 --> 05:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislative commission identified back
 
05:48:31.840 --> 05:48:32.670 align:start position:0%
legislative commission identified back
in

05:48:32.670 --> 05:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
2010 and the bill also as you just
 
05:48:37.310 --> 05:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
discussed would clarify that
 
05:48:39.070 --> 05:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
municipality that's doing this work can
 
05:48:41.190 --> 05:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
recoup costs um associated with it
 
05:48:42.430 --> 05:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
because they probably will need
 
05:48:44.110 --> 05:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
technical assistance from an outside
 
05:48:46.230 --> 05:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
consultant to look at the type of data
 
05:48:48.270 --> 05:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
that they would be um provided if they
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
did develop these
 
05:48:52.708 --> 05:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
regulations as was mentioned earlier and
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
also in our letter of testimony there
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
was a groundwater commission that the
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
legislature convened from 2003 to
 
05:49:02.310 --> 05:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
2010 that looked at a lot of issues and
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
did look at this issue and wrote a
 
05:49:07.110 --> 05:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
report on it the commission felt the
 
05:49:09.310 --> 05:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
report was complete you know identifying
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
the areas of law where we're not
 
05:49:12.708 --> 05:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
addressing water supply adequacy you
 
05:49:14.548 --> 05:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
know that's the areas um addressed by
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:49:17.788 --> 05:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
1483 but the commission had a lot of
 
05:49:20.190 --> 05:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
people on it over 20 people anything
 
05:49:22.070 --> 05:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
anybody from representing municipalities
 
05:49:24.270 --> 05:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
Senators representatives to business and
 
05:49:27.948 --> 05:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
industry ski industry Agriculture and so
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
while everyone agreed the report was
 
05:49:31.868 --> 05:49:31.878 align:start position:0%
complete and the fact and the facts of
 
05:49:34.270 --> 05:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
the report were accurate there was
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
disagreement on if there was a need for
 
05:49:38.110 --> 05:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
an increased Municipal role in
 
05:49:39.628 --> 05:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
regulating groundwater withdrawal so
 
05:49:40.628 --> 05:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
they didn't come up with a final
 
05:49:42.070 --> 05:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation there they just accepted
 
05:49:45.628 --> 05:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
the report as a essentially a technical
 
05:49:48.430 --> 05:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
resource and if anyone's interested in
 
05:49:51.270 --> 05:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
that report um I did bring copies of
 
05:49:52.628 --> 05:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
just the parts of the report that
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
address this issue including some model
 
05:49:57.788 --> 05:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
regulations that a municipality could
 
05:50:00.150 --> 05:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
adopt if if they wanted to perhaps now
 
05:50:01.990 --> 05:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
under existing statute but certainly if
 
05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was passed where it explicitly
 
05:50:06.150 --> 05:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
addresses Municipal regulation at the
 
05:50:08.350 --> 05:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
subdivision level I'd be happy to share
 
05:50:10.590 --> 05:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
those with you the model regulations are
 
05:50:12.590 --> 05:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
not Dees recommendations they're not
 
05:50:14.788 --> 05:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
Dees products they are the work of a
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
commission obviously myself and my
 
05:50:19.628 --> 05:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
colleague Steve Roy did a lot of the leg
 
05:50:22.230 --> 05:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
work for it but I just want to clarify
 
05:50:24.350 --> 05:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily documents that
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're promoting right now but they are
 
05:50:26.160 --> 05:50:26.990 align:start position:0%
we're promoting right now but they are
good

05:50:26.990 --> 05:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:50:29.390 --> 05:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
resources um the documents are 14 years
 
05:50:31.030 --> 05:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
old so some of the internet links are
 
05:50:32.788 --> 05:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
broken in it as well but there's still a
 
05:50:34.350 --> 05:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
lot of good information there may be
 
05:50:35.548 --> 05:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
05:50:39.430 --> 05:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
05:50:42.430 --> 05:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Darby thank you
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you um Mr K I taking my
 
05:50:47.390 --> 05:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
question just to similar to the question
 
05:50:49.468 --> 05:50:49.478 align:start position:0%
I asked um representative
 
05:50:53.468 --> 05:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
McGee um the um Community Water
 
05:50:57.070 --> 05:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
Systems I we just looked up the rule it
 
05:50:58.990 --> 05:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
seems like it's when it's 15 houses
 
05:51:00.190 --> 05:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
that's what makes it a community water
 
05:51:02.190 --> 05:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
system and every so this would be
 
05:51:03.868 --> 05:51:03.878 align:start position:0%
subdivisions like they could have a
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
large well if it's 10 houses and it's
 
05:51:07.830 --> 05:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
not considered a community water system
 
05:51:10.150 --> 05:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
if it's serving less than 25 people 25
 
05:51:11.708 --> 05:51:11.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much more than six
 
05:51:12.830 --> 05:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
months a
 
05:51:15.548 --> 05:51:15.558 align:start position:0%
year any other
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative Ron thank you
 
05:51:20.270 --> 05:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Mr Kel for taking my
 
05:51:22.510 --> 05:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
question just a follow up on um
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's question you're
 
05:51:28.670 --> 05:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
look when you when um there is a DS is
 
05:51:30.510 --> 05:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
looking at a large community withdrawal
 
05:51:32.868 --> 05:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
pro project they're looking at number of
 
05:51:34.830 --> 05:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
homes or number of bedrooms because
 
05:51:36.910 --> 05:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
septic systems are a number of
 
05:51:39.468 --> 05:51:39.478 align:start position:0%
bedrooms it it can be a a feature of the
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
development you know if it's a apartment
 
05:51:43.110 --> 05:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
complex that has a certain number of
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
bedrooms then we would apply a certain
 
05:51:47.310 --> 05:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
per capita to that to calculate it if
 
05:51:49.468 --> 05:51:49.478 align:start position:0%
it's a standalone House housing that has
 
05:51:50.910 --> 05:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
certain number of bedrooms we would look
 
05:51:53.190 --> 05:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
at that as well so it's kind of site
 
05:51:55.310 --> 05:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
specific and you know we cann't work
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
with the we work with the applicant to
 
05:51:58.788 --> 05:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
really pin down what is the problem
 
05:52:00.948 --> 05:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
population served of a given development
 
05:52:02.830 --> 05:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
okay so so it is more populationbased
 
05:52:06.548 --> 05:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
not just unit based okay thank you but
 
05:52:07.990 --> 05:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
certainly units are a Sur good of
 
05:52:08.000 --> 05:52:09.350 align:start position:0%
certainly units are a Sur good of
population

05:52:09.350 --> 05:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:52:12.190 --> 05:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
so any other
 
05:52:15.670 --> 05:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
question seeing none thank you for your
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
testimony my last pink card natch graay
 
05:52:22.270 --> 05:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:26.230 --> 05:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:28.708 --> 05:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair n Grace for the
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
municipal Association uh we do support
 
05:52:33.070 --> 05:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation I just want to make
 
05:52:34.948 --> 05:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
clear that this isn't a problem isolated
 
05:52:38.590 --> 05:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
to Hollis um and doing research uh and
 
05:52:40.590 --> 05:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
advance for the legislation I'm aware
 
05:52:42.510 --> 05:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities of Auburn
 
05:52:45.510 --> 05:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
Northampton Raymond Rochester and Windam
 
05:52:48.910 --> 05:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
have all um gone through approval
 
05:52:51.430 --> 05:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
processes for subdivisions where it
 
05:52:53.390 --> 05:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
turns out either the water supply was
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
inadequate for the originally planned
 
05:52:59.190 --> 05:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
number of units or uh the water itself
 
05:53:02.350 --> 05:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
was not um in a condition that it was
 
05:53:04.750 --> 05:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
treatable so it was had a high degree of
 
05:53:06.390 --> 05:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
iron and manganese or or other
 
05:53:09.390 --> 05:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
contaminants in it um one of the things
 
05:53:12.030 --> 05:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
that we believe that this will do is
 
05:53:13.150 --> 05:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
move the
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
conversation um kind of the as a local
 
05:53:21.270 --> 05:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
option on the front side of um housing
 
05:53:23.708 --> 05:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
housing and other development for the
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy of water um whereas it's
 
05:53:27.788 --> 05:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
currently exists on the on the backs
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
side so you often see people come before
 
05:53:31.750 --> 05:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
the planning board go through that whole
 
05:53:35.230 --> 05:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
process and then once they you know
 
05:53:37.310 --> 05:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
basically receive that local approval or
 
05:53:39.230 --> 05:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
pretty close to it that's when they go
 
05:53:42.548 --> 05:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
to Dees to receive um approval for the
 
05:53:44.510 --> 05:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
wells and that's when they discover
 
05:53:45.830 --> 05:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with the water so
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of time effort and money
 
05:53:50.350 --> 05:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh put into projects which simply can't
 
05:53:52.628 --> 05:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
get off the ground because most people
 
05:53:54.750 --> 05:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
are not going to buy properties that
 
05:53:57.510 --> 05:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a water supply um so as
 
05:53:59.310 --> 05:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned previous viously this is is a
 
05:54:01.150 --> 05:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
local option I would assume it would be
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
of most interest in those communities
 
05:54:05.350 --> 05:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
where there are known water issues and
 
05:54:06.910 --> 05:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
of course we would work closely with
 
05:54:09.910 --> 05:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
Dees to um help provide those
 
05:54:12.548 --> 05:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
communities any sort of model guidance
 
05:54:15.070 --> 05:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
that may be helpful um should this
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
legislation pass and I'm happy to uh
 
05:54:19.510 --> 05:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the commune may
 
05:54:23.110 --> 05:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative Darby
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
um thanks thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:54:26.270 --> 05:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question we need to talk
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
about known water issues I didn't pick
 
05:54:30.868 --> 05:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
this up earlier but might you think
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
about for example pasas in groundwater
 
05:54:35.430 --> 05:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
as as something that could be regulated
 
05:54:39.270 --> 05:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
um and tested for I think that's a known
 
05:54:40.990 --> 05:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
issue um there are certain communities
 
05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
in the state that are affected by pasas
 
05:54:46.830 --> 05:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
and obviously other contaminants um one
 
05:54:48.590 --> 05:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
of the questions certainly of for new
 
05:54:51.548 --> 05:54:51.558 align:start position:0%
development going in uh and existing
 
05:54:53.708 --> 05:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
development is where that contamination
 
05:54:55.990 --> 05:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
is um and that's certainly a question I
 
05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
would assume that most people would be
 
05:54:59.910 --> 05:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
interested in who are looking to build
 
05:55:02.110 --> 05:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
in those
 
05:55:05.350 --> 05:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
communities any other
 
05:55:07.628 --> 05:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
questions I have a technical question
 
05:55:11.070 --> 05:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
now you can't leave yet sure um since I
 
05:55:13.628 --> 05:55:13.638 align:start position:0%
know you're an attorney um you mentioned
 
05:55:15.430 --> 05:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
going from the back side to the front
 
05:55:19.788 --> 05:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
side so under current law and statutes
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
can the planning board now with going
 
05:55:24.628 --> 05:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
through the normal process of amending
 
05:55:26.670 --> 05:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
the planning board regulations and
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
Zoning pass a law that does what this
 
05:55:30.080 --> 05:55:31.948 align:start position:0%
Zoning pass a law that does what this
bill

05:55:31.948 --> 05:55:31.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:55:36.590 --> 05:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
suggests so it's not currently expressed
 
05:55:40.310 --> 05:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
in 674 36 which contains a long list of
 
05:55:42.830 --> 05:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
things that um subdivision regulations
 
05:55:42.840 --> 05:55:43.750 align:start position:0%
things that um subdivision regulations
may

05:55:43.750 --> 05:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:55:48.270 --> 05:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
do because of that I
 
05:55:51.030 --> 05:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
would suggest that the legislature
 
05:55:53.670 --> 05:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
consider adding this to the list just to
 
05:55:55.350 --> 05:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that this is
 
05:55:57.468 --> 05:55:57.478 align:start position:0%
something that they may do um that
 
05:55:58.990 --> 05:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
avoids is having to have any sort of
 
05:56:00.548 --> 05:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
Court battles over
 
05:56:04.070 --> 05:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you any other uh
 
05:56:06.230 --> 05:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative Derby for a followup
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks again for
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question I only um just
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
scanning through it again I only see
 
05:56:17.110 --> 05:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
testing with respect to uh water supply
 
05:56:19.150 --> 05:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
um and water quantity as opposed to
 
05:56:21.590 --> 05:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
water quality you know we had a bill
 
05:56:24.788 --> 05:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
last year about um mandatory testing for
 
05:56:27.070 --> 05:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
new wells and that doesn't seem to be
 
05:56:28.430 --> 05:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem to be cover and that
 
05:56:30.110 --> 05:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
was pretty contentious um this doesn't
 
05:56:32.190 --> 05:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
seem to cover that it just seems to be
 
05:56:34.310 --> 05:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
Supply so am I missing
 
05:56:37.030 --> 05:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
something uh I don't think so I think um
 
05:56:39.390 --> 05:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
maybe I misspoke earlier um with the
 
05:56:42.110 --> 05:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
quantity issue
 
05:56:45.788 --> 05:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
um obviously one of the questions that
 
05:56:48.548 --> 05:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
that I think that we would have
 
05:56:48.558 --> 05:56:50.390 align:start position:0%
that I think that we would have
with

05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:56:53.310 --> 05:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
um the the quantity is that we we want
 
05:56:55.750 --> 05:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there actually is
 
05:56:58.190 --> 05:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
water present um but the quality issue
 
05:57:00.910 --> 05:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
comes into that because um if you have a
 
05:57:03.390 --> 05:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
low water quantity and I think this
 
05:57:05.110 --> 05:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
might be a more appropriate question for
 
05:57:09.030 --> 05:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
for um Mr kernin uh to answer but if you
 
05:57:10.948 --> 05:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
have certain indicators with water
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
quantity um that may indicate that there
 
05:57:15.830 --> 05:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
is some sort of contaminant there I mean
 
05:57:17.390 --> 05:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
that may not be the case with past but
 
05:57:18.708 --> 05:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
it may be the case with something like
 
05:57:21.270 --> 05:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
manganese or or iron but I'm not the
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:26.798 --> 05:57:28.548 align:start position:0%
 
me

05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:57:30.510 --> 05:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
another representative Darby asked that
 
05:57:33.628 --> 05:57:33.638 align:start position:0%
I'll have a follow up um before they can
 
05:57:36.150 --> 05:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
get a bu occupancy permit in town
 
05:57:38.468 --> 05:57:38.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the water have to be tested and
 
05:57:42.590 --> 05:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
proved portable to answer the quality
 
05:57:46.910 --> 05:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
question yes I believe so thank you any
 
05:57:46.920 --> 05:57:48.430 align:start position:0%
question yes I believe so thank you any
other

05:57:48.430 --> 05:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:57:50.708 --> 05:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:57:52.548 --> 05:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you and I don't have any
 
05:57:55.110 --> 05:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
other pink cards so I'll ask twice
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
anyone else to testify on hb14
 
05:58:02.590 --> 05:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
83 anyone else ATT test to I am 1483
 
05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
seeing no one approaching the mic I'll
 
05:58:07.110 --> 05:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HB
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
1483 thank you very
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:26.718 --> 05:58:29.718 align:start position:0%
