uh veterans into the state

repeat much of what my written testimony
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
has already said about the department's
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
continuum for license reciprocity the
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
status of licensed portability in new
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire and federal statute which
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
includes licensure as part of the
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
military service's strategic basing
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
criteria our bottom line is a license
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
within 30 days taking care of military
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
families is the fourth line of effort in
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
the united states national defense
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
strategy pre-pandemic research showed
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
that unemployment rates for licensed
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
military spouses were as high as 28
 
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.190 align:start position:0%
military spouses were as high as 28
percent

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
since 2017 the department has
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
established and is working on three
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
lines of effort to improve license
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
portability for military spouses these
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
lines of efforts seek to immediately
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
improve state licensing laws to allow a
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
military spouse to receive a license
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
with minimal initial paperwork within 30
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
days of their application
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the near term to ensure that state
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
licensing boards implement their laws
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
and make information about their
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
application practices accessible to
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
military spouses and long term to
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
approve profession-specific licensure
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
compacts which the department perceives
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
as the optimum end-state solution to
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
portability an area where new hampshire
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
and this committee has been an
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
unquestionable leader nationwide as
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
there is not currently a compact for
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
every occupation nor is every state a
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
member of each compact the department
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
continues to engage the states on the
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
issue of military spousal licensure and
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
pursue a variety of approaches to
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
reciprocity simultaneously while the
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
states continue to work towards better
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
portability the best evidence we have
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
about the quality benefits of licensure
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
relate to occupations that are
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
universally licensed which tend to have
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
more harmonized standards across states
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
where we do not have any strong evidence
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
however is to suggest that the type of
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
license recognition in house bill 1653
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
is associated with worse quality or
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
worse care outcomes providing a
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
temporary license to qualified
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
applicants who have proven competency in
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
another state allows the military spouse
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
to practice while fulfilling
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
requirements needed to qualify for
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
endorsement in new hampshire
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
or awaiting verification of
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
documentation supporting an endorsement
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
or a background check
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
this type of well-designed licensure
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
regime can enhance public safety while
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
expanding health care access in
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
historically underserved communities and
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
participation in the workforce by
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
historically excluded groups such as
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
military spouses thanks to the
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
leadership of both the new hampshire
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
general court and the new hampshire
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
department of military affairs and
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
veteran services the department of
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the new
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
support of this bill to improve
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
implementation of existing statutes new
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire's cultural norm to ask the
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
question if individuals or their
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
families have served in the military has
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
led to the inclusion of a means to
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
indicate military spouse status on all
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
license applications the department of
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
defense is now asking state policy
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
makers to assess the actions of the
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
licensing boards to implement these
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
changes to laws and make information
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
about licensure more easily acceptable
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
research by dod's office of people
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
analytics has found an empirical link
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
between spousal support for a service
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
member to stay on active duty and actual
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
retention outcomes the policies
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%

in new hampshire serving in other states
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
the labor market is more competitive
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
than ever last year just over the border
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the pine tree state the governor
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
signed a bill which contained an almost
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
identical proposal and the provisions
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
for enrollment timing and protecting
 
00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:07.430 align:start position:0%
for enrollment timing and protecting
intuition

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
intuition
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts state senate has
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
passed almost the same bill they call it
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
the spouse license portability education
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
and enrollment of dependence or speed
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
act in fact 29 states have enacted
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
policies for licensure enhancement 35
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
states have addressed licensure access
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
32 states have allowed for advanced
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
enrollment four states have already
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
passed school placement equity equity
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
which is our newest issue for 2022. 35
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
states have addressed in-state tuition
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
continuity and 46 states have passed
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
state employment protections for the
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
national guard while this is promising i
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
can think of no single state which has
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
addressed all these policies together
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
as house bill 1653 would do passage of
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
these policies would make new hampshire
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
the unquestioned leader nationwide in
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
addressing key quality of life issues
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%

he's better looking than i am so
i

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
i do want to ask uh
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
chris if uh
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
reciprocity so i see the new language
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
would allow someone who served in a
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
another state's
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
militia or national guard
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
they even if they didn't serve in this
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
state if they were residents of this
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
state then they would be eligible for
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
the for the benefit is that correct
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
correct so uh you likely have uh
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
instances for example where folks might
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
be assigned to a
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
naval shipyard portsmouth and they are
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
if they're called to active military
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
service uh in maine uh they would not be
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for state employment
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
protections under the state uh service
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
members civil relief act uh because
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
ucera does not
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
pertain to title 32 national guard and
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
reserve component service similarly if
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
you're a new hampshire resident and
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
you're serving in the massachusetts
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
national guard or you work in new
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and your job is is in the
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire but you're
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
serving in the vermont national guard
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
you do not get those employment
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
protections if the governor of vermont
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
calls you to active duty
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
so the reciprocity
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
really is not
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
in effect across the board some states
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
may similarly
 
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.029 align:start position:0%
may similarly
honor

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
honor
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
national guardsmen who served in the new
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire guard but they now live in a
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
different state
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
that may or may not they may or may not
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
be able to access the same benefit in
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
another state depends on the state is
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
that roger so 46 states have
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
passed this provision and new hampshire
 
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
passed this provision and new hampshire
pennsylvania

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh new york and maryland are the four
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
remaining uh to add the language this
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
state or any other state to their
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
statute so we're one of four states that
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
needs that is not in sync with the other
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
46 that's what i'm hearing correct okay
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh questions other questions
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%

00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill but i want to

yeah send it to me and then i'll share
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
with representative loomis for the
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
record roger okay thank you
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh
 
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.230 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh
yes

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my time
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
i just have a question about reciprocity
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
of licensing and i am a licensed new
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire licensed psychologist so i
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
understand these problems in moving
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
across states so if someone comes here
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
for example with a psychologist's
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
license and i know
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of psychologists in the
 
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.630 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of psychologists in the
military

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
military
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
automatically be issued a license by the
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state board or how would
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
that work i'm just copy so
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
under federal law
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh if you're serving uh uh
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
on federal active duty a valid license
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
in any state is all that's required so
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
if a person is is assigned to any of the
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
uniformed services whether that's the
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
united states public health service the
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
army the navy the air force and they're
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
assigned to new hampshire they would
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
operate under their
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
state home state license and they don't
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
need a specific fix
 
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.470 align:start position:0%
need a specific fix
where

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
where the department of defense has
 
00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:33.350 align:start position:0%
where the department of defense has
identified

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
uh the the challenge insofar as
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
retention outcomes is for spousal
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
support so it's when they're moving
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
across the country and let's say their
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
spouse is a licensed uh clinical
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
psychologist and as you likely know the
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
psychology inter-jurisdictional compact
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
isn't a true uh uh privilege to practice
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
as the other compacts are it's more of a
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
telehealth a 30-day privilege
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
type of mechanism so that is why having
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
a good
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
state specific
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
licensing law that would allow a spouse
 
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.110 align:start position:0%
licensing law that would allow a spouse
to

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
pursue the full state license but still
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
operate when they're coming from a
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
non-compact state so for example if
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
they're coming from massachusetts which
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
has not yet joined
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
scipac and they're re-assigned from
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
hanscom air force base
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
let's say to new boston space force
 
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:27.110 align:start position:0%
let's say to new boston space force
station

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
station
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh that spouse would be eligible for a
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
license under
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
this provision if they meet certain
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
requirements such as holding a valid out
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
of state license for a certain period of
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
time and they're issued the temporary
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
license and
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
have i think one chance to renew it
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
while they're pursuing whatever state
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
specific requirements there are to
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.029 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher um
 
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher um
so

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah i'm i i'm kind of curious more
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.230 align:start position:0%
about the
um

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.590 align:start position:0%
um
licensing

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
reform aspect about it um which yeah you
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
did a good job explaining so far um
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
issue area that
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
i've been noticing increased activism
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
surrounding lately so i was kind of
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could
 
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.630 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could
fit

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
fit
 
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.990 align:start position:0%
fit
um

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
fit the pro licensing provisions
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
in this bill into
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
the larger
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing
 
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.950 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing
conversation

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
like letting us know what
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
groups and literature on the topic
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
you've consulted
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
copy so the
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of military spouse licensure
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
has been a concern of the department um
 
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.310 align:start position:0%
has been a concern of the department um
for

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
really over a decade now
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
and in my written testimony which i
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
apologize if you haven't received a copy
 
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.990 align:start position:0%
apologize if you haven't received a copy
but

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know i go into a fair amount of
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
detail so
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
the original ask
 
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.430 align:start position:0%
the original ask
between

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
2011 and 2016
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
by the department of defense to the
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
states was to approve
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
profession specific
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh intra-state licensure laws uh for a
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
number of pathways towards a full
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
license whether that was licensed by
 
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.950 align:start position:0%
license whether that was licensed by
endorsement

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
endorsement
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh whether that was an expedited license
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
or whether that was a reciprocal license
 
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.950 align:start position:0%
or whether that was a reciprocal license
and

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
what we found over time was the
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
definition of reciprocity or the
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
definition of expedited varied from
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
state to state and every state likes to
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
think they have expedited uh licensure
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
but there's a difference between you
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
know putting something at the top of the
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
pile and then taking eight months to
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that pile or getting the
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
license uh out the door
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
in ten days so
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh we uh engaged with the clearinghouse
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
for a military family readiness at
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania state university uh in 2021
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
and they did an exhaustive 50-state
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
review of six occupational boards in
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
each state with real military spouses
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
going on the website looking for the
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
information calling up and seeing if the
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
person that they were speaking to
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh was knowledgeable and trained
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
actually filling out the application to
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
test how long it took and that was a
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
follow-on study to the 2017 effort
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
by the center for military reach at
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
university of minnesota we also have an
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
annual congressional reporting
 
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.750 align:start position:0%
annual congressional reporting
requirement

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the house armed services committee
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the national defense
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
authorization act so each year
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
we update the congress on the status of
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
removing barriers to military spousal
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
licensure within each state so
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
to your question specifically this
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
particular approach we're sort of the
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
carrot if you will we can show you best
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
practices from other states but we don't
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
have a a real box that we want you to go
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
in other than to get that license out
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
the door within 30 days
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
and for a temporary licensure regardless
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
of the military spouse's years of
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
experience in an occupation boards often
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
look to test scores and academic records
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
which can take a tremendous amount of
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
time to verify if they're asking for
 
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
time to verify if they're asking for
your

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
college algebra from 1996. um military
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
assignments have a duration of
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
approximately two to three years so most
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
folks will be on their fifth or sixth uh
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
license and uh depending on the state
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
may have to hold
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
those licenses in another state in order
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
to receive reciprocity and it can be
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
expensive to maintain you know four or
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
five licenses to get to one license in
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
another state because i need the the
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
one type of training from this state and
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
another type of training for that state
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
and i've amalgamated a license myself so
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
military spouses who have maintained a
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
successful career in a variety of
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
locations and circumstances expressed
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
frustration over having to justify their
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
credibility and competency in the same
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
manner as first-time applicants
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
which is why i think this bill would
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
provide a pathway
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
to get them to working just a little bit
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
faster while they're pursuing whatever
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
specific safeguards there are in place
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
to obtain that full state license
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
because that's always going to be their
 
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.549 align:start position:0%
because that's always going to be their
goal

00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
and with the population of military
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
spouses about 5 000 probably less than
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
half in licensed occupations
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
and many of them would already qualify
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
under a compact uh or because they have
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state license for a full
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
license you're talking about you know a
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
few dozen people a year so it's sort of
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
a de minimis uh impact
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
in in the whole but it's still a good
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
option to have in the toolkit in my
 
00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.750 align:start position:0%
option to have in the toolkit in my
opinion

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you sir for being here
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%

am a 25-year air force veteran and a
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
23-year resident of hooksett new
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire the state veterans advisory
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee is is really happy to support
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
and every chance that i get to talk to
 
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.789 align:start position:0%
and every chance that i get to talk to
people

00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
about veterans and things like that i
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
always like to try and leave them with
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
this thought
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
when one of us serves the whole family
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
serves and the military veterans in this
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
in this in this audience know what i'm
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
talking about in terms of the the
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
hardship that spouses and children go
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
through when you pick up and move every
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
couple of years and as i was thinking
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
about what i wanted to tell you today i
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
grew i not only had a military family of
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
my own but i grew up in a military
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
family my father was in the air force
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
and as i sat down last night i thought
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
to myself you went to a lot of different
 
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.830 align:start position:0%
to myself you went to a lot of different
schools

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
um from grade 1 to grade 12 i went to 10
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
different schools
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
and and you know while that's a pretty
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
large number i don't think that seven or
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
eight schools to get 12 years in is that
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
uncommon across our military and so
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's a little easier for today's kids
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
because they've got cell phones and they
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
can face time with their friends at the
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
old place while they're making new
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
friends at the at the new location but
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to help those people
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
make that transition better
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
i i'm really in favor of so i was very
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
excited to see
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
us talking about
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
special services for kids it it's it's a
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
little bit rare for someone to get
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
transferred in the middle of the year it
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
generally speaking most military moves
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
have sort of migrated to the summer time
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
to make this process a little easier but
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
things like command slots and things
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
like that might require that you that
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
you transition in january
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
and you might know that two or three
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
months ahead of time and if you have the
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to enroll your kids in
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
school already and perhaps at that
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
school level those teachers could reach
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
out to your children electronically
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of stuff
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
electronically now as it is if you could
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
reach out to those kids electronically
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
and say here's what we're doing in our
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
eighth grade math class right now so you
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
know here's the things you ought to be
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
trying to look and here's some
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
assignments that you can do and i'll
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
grade them and then that way you can get
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
a grade for these things as you as you
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
move on so i'm really excited about that
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
and the idea that if if somebody's going
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
to be deployed there could be some
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
access to some special services that are
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
called for in this bill for a young
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
child particularly if you think about it
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
what about a single parent that gets
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
deployed no they've got to have a plan
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
for what they're going to do with their
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
their children but that could be a
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
fairly traumatic experience and the
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
folks at the school ought to know about
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
that and be ready to go with a with a
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
plan to help out kids if they start to
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
see a a drop off in their performance or
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
or signs that they're that things are
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
not right
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
before we made the transition over at
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
peace to the kc-46 tanker we had
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
actually stood up an active duty kc 135
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
squadron right alongside of our our
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
guard unit and as i told you the other
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
day the crews are interchangeable can do
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
all this stuff i would expect as the
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
kc-46 really fully comes on board with
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
this refueling capabilities we're going
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing we're going to be
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
looking at probably about 100
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
or so military families over at uh at
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
pease when all this is said and done
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
that are active duty and that are going
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
to rotate in and out the temporary
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
licensing thing
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
the most important part of that is it
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
allows that spouse to work immediately
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
okay while they're working through any
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
specific thing that they don't have in
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
their profile that they need to get
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
licensed in new hampshire it allows them
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
to get a job right now because as
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
anybody in here who has ever moved knows
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
moving is expensive
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
and you don't get reimbursed all the
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
time for everything you that you do and
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
if that if you've been relying on that
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
spouse's money to to make ends meet it's
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
important to have that opportunity for
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
that spouse especially in a professional
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
field to get hired
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
right away
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
the in-state tuition thing i noted in
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
the financial note that the community
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
college system says it's probably going
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
to be transparent to them the university
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
system didn't think that there would be
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
much impact there but i'll leave you
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
with this thought if if a student starts
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
their education at the university of new
 
00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
their education at the university of new
hampshire

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
and particularly if you know now active
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
duty folks can transfer their gi bill
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility to their children if they
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
want to and so now their children are
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to school on the gi bill you've
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
got gi bill benefit money coming to the
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire if if we don't
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
sweeten the pot by saying you can
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
continue the in-state to win tuition
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire if your family moves
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
out of state you can just stay and be a
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
full-time student at unh then the
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
possibility exists that we may lose
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
revenue on this deal because that that
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
family will say well it's going to be
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
more less expensive for us to put our
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
child in a college in the new location
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
and it's not fair to the student who
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
really maybe is loving where they are
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
and now through no fault of their own
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to move yet again
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
um i want to leave you with the thought
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
that when i translated to transf uh when
 
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.830 align:start position:0%
that when i translated to transf uh when
i

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
i spoke on house bill 1505 which which
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
was the military justice contract last
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
time and i said the more that as federal
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
programs work their way down the state
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
level the more we can be sort of
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
mirroring those things the better off
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to be i just kind of want to
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
remind you of that and also
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
hb 1056 that we talked about last week
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
that you folks put on the on the consent
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
calendar as ought to pass with the idea
 
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.230 align:start position:0%
calendar as ought to pass with the idea
of

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
studying how we attract veterans to the
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
state putting a committee together to
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
work specifically on that this bill i
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
think goes a long way to to fulfilling
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
those goals and that's really all i want
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
to talk about this morning unless you
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh appreciate the
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
the measure that was changed a few years
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
ago allowing
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
veterans to transfer their educational
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
benefits to their children
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that i was able to
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
actually personally uh take advantage of
 
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.310 align:start position:0%
actually personally uh take advantage of
that

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.670 align:start position:0%
that
change

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that i had a
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
daughter who went to college before that
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
was in effect and she graduated with
 
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.790 align:start position:0%
was in effect and she graduated with
a

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
great debt and my subsequent daughter
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
had everything paid for because of this
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
veteran's benefit transfer benefit and
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
finally would you believe that
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
one daughter is very happy with me and
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
one is not because of that so yes sir i
 
00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
one is not because of that so yes sir i
can

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
i can certainly appreciate that the
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
person that has no debt is is feeling a
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
lot better about life uh yeah thank you
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
that and that's uh something where i
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
have to work through internally yeah
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr grady german anyone
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
here in close and i will return the
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
gavel to
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
our chair
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative moffat i got a question
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh since we're off the record now for
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
christopher uh
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
years ago we passed the education bill
 
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.270 align:start position:0%
years ago we passed the education bill
on

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
veterans moving into the state because
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
the yellow ribbon program only paid
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
did they ever fix that bill where
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
veterans go anywhere in the country
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
and pay in-state or is it still an
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that came off of our key issue
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
list in or around
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
2009 or 2010 because the congress did
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately provide a 50-state solution
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the ndia okay thank you is howard
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
cooney still working for the dod uh
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
negative he retired after 50 years of
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
service and he he suckered me into
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking uh his job
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
for those that i know on the committee
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
here that have been here long enough
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
harold cooney was the dod rep here that
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
we worked for years new hampshire about
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
six years ago i believe i think it was
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
six years we were the first state in the
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
country really to put in licensing and
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
credentialing so i was honored to be
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
invited by michelle obama to go to the
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
white house and sit at the table because
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
she was pushing licensing and
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
credentialing throughout the whole
 
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.230 align:start position:0%
credentialing throughout the whole
country

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
and we had a meeting i was only state

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do we're going to be
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
executing hopefully about uh 10
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%

okay uh i recommend you knock caucus
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go upstairs and the reason
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
why we're gonna uh knock caucus here
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
because this is on youtube
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
so i recommend the uh for the democrats
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
you go to another area
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay and then we're gonna go up on the
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
third deck and then we'll meet back down
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
here about 10 o'clock
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then we will start executing now
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
we've already we've been fortunate
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
because as we
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh stuck together as a whole team
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
republican democrats and we uh one two
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
three four five
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
we've already um knocked out six of our
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh 19 bills
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
so hopefully uh we'll be able to move
 
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.190 align:start position:0%
so hopefully uh we'll be able to move
quick

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
and then this committee work will be
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
done until we do crossover whatever
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
comes over from the senate
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
okay so therefore let's go ahead and
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
take a break upstairs for the
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%

time and this one here is the next step
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh above on making sure we're taking
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%

okay the floor is yours thank you mr
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
chair so uh this amendment is a slight
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
oversight i had when drafting uh it's a
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
house resolution condemning the
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
communist party of china and the
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
people's republic of china but i seem to
 
01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
have forgotten to add the ambassador uh
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the people's republic of china to the
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
united states in the original bill so
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
this adds the ambassador of the republic
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
of china as one of the people who will
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
receive a copy of this house resolution
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
and it also adds the taiwanese
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
ambassador uh to the list of places that
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
this uh house resolution will be sent if
 
01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.270 align:start position:0%
this uh house resolution will be sent if
passed

01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh is there anyone else who want to
 
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.709 align:start position:0%
okay uh is there anyone else who want to
speak

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:27:00.719 --> 01:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
speak
on

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative moffat
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
famous chairs have a question uh i know
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
we certainly have a
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
ambassador from the prc
 
01:27:09.199 --> 01:27:09.990 align:start position:0%
ambassador from the prc
uh

01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
in that we don't have diplomatic formal
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
diplomatic relations with uh
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
the republic of china taiwan
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
i do if we don't have an if there is no
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
ambassador from
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
who i'm just trying to understand who
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
this would go to
 
01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:28.629 align:start position:0%
this would go to
uh

01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
and um so you can find that at the last
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
line it's the taipei economic and
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
cultural representative because we
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
currently do not have formal relations
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
with the republic of china due to the
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
one china policy which i wholeheartedly
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
disagree with
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
an ambassador
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
but not called an ambassador it's called
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
the taiwanese uh representative office
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
and they're technically not in an
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
embassy but for all intents and purposes
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
perfect got it thank you
 
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
perfect got it thank you
okay

01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
this was an amendment i thought it was
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
coming but
 
01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.430 align:start position:0%
coming but
um

01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't discuss this one anyway but i
 
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.149 align:start position:0%
we didn't discuss this one anyway but i
agree

01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
with you i do so yeah
 
01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.430 align:start position:0%
with you i do so yeah
okay

01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
ah what's that can i speak oh yes
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that i am opposed to
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment i think that it's um
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for us as a committee and
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
the house to be a pining on
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
international affairs and this amendment
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
actually makes the bill worse by
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
communicating directly with a foreign
 
01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.310 align:start position:0%
communicating directly with a foreign
government

01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
our diplomatic offices federally so i'm
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else uh representative chase
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
i i i wholeheartedly support the
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment i think the reason why is it
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense the people in new hampshire
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
and people of america right now are very
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
upset with them the way that this regime
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
has treated other countries in the
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
region i think it makes perfect sense
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
that for this body to be able to voice
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
its opinion on the international stage
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
of how this regime has treated its own
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
people other people that it's
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
essentially colonized
 
01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.470 align:start position:0%
essentially colonized
and

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
and how it's treated even our country on
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
the international stage too i think i
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
think more states more countries the
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
united states as a whole needs to
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly denounce this regime and
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
really stand up so if new hampshire is
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
one of the first states to send such a
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
strong statement why not
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think the people expect it i think i
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
think china really is a uh it's a demon
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
to democracy and um and freedom
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
around the world so i think this is a
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
great step in the right direction i
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative lebranch
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
brought this forward i think it's also
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
good too for us to uh we're denouncing
 
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:44.709 align:start position:0%
good too for us to uh we're denouncing
them

01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
we should you know we should say it to
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
their face
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
right why say it just in hollow words
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
and just send it to the congress for it
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
to be lost on the clerk's desk there
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
it should go right to their desk yup
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
thanks moffatt
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
famous chair i think representative
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
piedra makes a very valid legitimate uh
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
observation in that uh is that our our
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
job to make such a resolution and my
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
thought to that is that there is a long
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
history in this body of occasionally
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
discussing which we've done and voting
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
on which will do
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
resolutions on all manner of things so i
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
think that uh
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative pierre makes a very valid
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
point um
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
but i i also support the amendment and
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh and we'll discuss and vote on it as
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
is our our custom
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll ask the clerk to take a

01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
so this resolution is basically saying
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh that we oppose the federal and state
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
efforts to establish a carbon tax on
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
fuels for electricity and transportation
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
considering that we know there's a
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
an established
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
correlation between
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of energy and the availability
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
energy and the
 
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.870 align:start position:0%
energy and the
um

01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:33.669 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
standard of living for for people within
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
a society
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
and that currently we're looking at
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
record inflation
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
that we're also looking at um
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
energy shortages rolling blackouts and
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
having um
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
the cost of fuels
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
the skyrocket i think that a a carbon
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
tax at this time would be detrimental to
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
our society and
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm encouraging people to vote um
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this resolution
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%

01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
.0029 percent we're not in peril and you

01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
the unreliables so
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
there's no teeth to this resolution it's
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%

the conferences that the other
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
gentlelady just mentioned i think
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
they're just just plain wrong i i trust
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
the experts who say
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
that um the co2
 
01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
that um the co2
levels

01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
are causing uh
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
climate change in that climate changing
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
of catastrophic results especially if
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
you live near the seacoast like i do and
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
in fact it already is having those
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
results and
 
01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:23.910 align:start position:0%
results and
also

01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
not a couple of the bullet points are
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
just plain false including the one about
 
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.189 align:start position:0%
just plain false including the one about
uh

01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
the tax code shouldn't be used to
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
manipulate consumer decisions there's
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
all kinds of incentives in the tax code
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of which party is
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh in charge or what their goals are so
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know changing the consumer
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
decisions is indeed one of the central
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
functions of the tax tax code
 
01:41:48.719 --> 01:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
functions of the tax tax code
and

01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
and also in addition to the co2 the
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
alternatives are
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
that would mostly cause a shift
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy like solar wind power
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
and water power and
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
by the way the uh
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
if you worry about the fact that wind
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't blow all the time or there's
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
cloudies there are like various
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
divisions i can do
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
a new um
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
invention called the battery which may
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
be a few if you've ever heard of another
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
so that's um
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
anyways i would just say uh
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
i would just say that so i just say like
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
this this is a bad um
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
bad bill on its merits and also of
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
course sending an hr nobody really we're
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
gonna get a letter from the speaker's
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
office none of these
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
officials that we're sending things to
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
are gonna change their uh
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
the our congressional delegation is
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
probably not going to change their
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
opinion just based on this nicely
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
done up official letter from the speaker
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
i would vote it a lot but anyway
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
i vote itl on this because i think uh
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's the wrong it's the wrong
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
message and the wrong way to send it and
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
the wrong thing to do about it so thank
 
01:42:56.719 --> 01:42:57.430 align:start position:0%
the wrong thing to do about it so thank
you

01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative branch
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
i am the youngest representative ever in
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house uh i'm one of
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
these people that will be affected by
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
let them speak please
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
please let them
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
speak i'm just saying uh
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
actual record-wise i am the youngest
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
office holder of a new hampshire
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative i thought i was but go
 
01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.109 align:start position:0%
representative i thought i was but go
ahead

01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:43:25.119 --> 01:43:27.510 align:start position:0%
ahead
so

01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
so at age 20 i i have a long life ahead
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
of me i hope uh
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
and and i'm one of these people that
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
will be affected by climate change and
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is simply just putting a price on
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
pollution just like if you throw a water
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
bottle out your window you will be fine
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
for pollution we're putting carbon in
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere we're putting pollutants
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
into the air and it just seems like
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
common sense to be taxing pollution
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
because we already do so when it comes
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
to throwing your garbage on the side of
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
the road
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
and two
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
my esteemed colleague on the other side
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
talking about how unreliable renewables
 
01:43:58.639 --> 01:43:59.990 align:start position:0%
talking about how unreliable renewables
are

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'm one of the few representatives that
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
is pro-nuclear energy
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i would say that nuclear energy is a
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral form of power and it will
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
serve as a base load so if we can have a
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
mix of renewables and nuclear power
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
and nuclear power as a base load that
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
will at least keep a consistent uh
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
rate of energy for when we have spikes
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
in demand during the daytime
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other uh
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative nada
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and i disagree with my friend
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
over there and i am i'm happy to hear
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
that you're for nuclear energy because
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
and there's no carbon emissions at all
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
with nuclear energy it's a very fine um
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
form of energy
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
the carbon tax has not worked in europe
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
and u.s the u.s produces only 15 percent
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
of carbon dioxide emissions so it's a
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
lot of money spent up to upwards to 800
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars and for very very very
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
very little return and it wouldn't make
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
a difference so where all the pollution
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
is coming from like china
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's where the effort should go thank
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh yeah i'm gonna add uh
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
to this here which i was kind of
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
surprised on 380 million dollars being
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
collected on a carbon tax
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
and you know something i look at it
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
years ago when i was in another party we
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
cared about the um
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm not knocking anyone today i'm
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
just saying when i was with another
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
party i'm not gonna mention but we care
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
about the elderly we care about the
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
working people we care about trying not
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
to tax them and taking more money out of
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
their pockets so they can feed their
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
families pay their rents
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
and put food on the table
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
and then i seen the light over the years
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
when i realized that
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
they weren't doing that no more they
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
weren't fighting for the working people
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
they weren't fighting for the elderly
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
they weren't fighting they didn't care
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
we taxed everything that moved
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
and when i switched over into the
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
republicans i realized that
 
01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.310 align:start position:0%
republicans i realized that
um

01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
i want to maintain i want to be able to
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
spend my own money i want to protect the
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
elderly i want to protect the uh working
 
01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.590 align:start position:0%
elderly i want to protect the uh working
people

01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
this here
 
01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:02.070 align:start position:0%
this here
tax

01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:03.109 align:start position:0%
tax
takes

01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
takes
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
money out of hard-working people's
 
01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
pocket when we think we're going after
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
the businesses we're not what we're
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
doing is we're redistributing that money
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
because they're going after the
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
consumers to pick up the cost
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
on this here because we're going to tax
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
them on carbon but yet there's no remedy
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
to fix it
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to take their money and
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
then automatically most uh americans
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
think oh all of a sudden at the time the
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
cabin's gone it's we we got their money
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
they're carbon free until next year so
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
we'll tax them again
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay so this mentality has been going on
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
too long
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
al gore is living like a king
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
off of this dream of climate change
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
and dr flying around in big planes and
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
meanwhile everyone else is following him
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
everyone else is saying oh oh that's the
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
way to go and he's living in a big 20
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
room mansion or whatever he's living in
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh but we're falling like
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
puppets i fell into the dream with the
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
solar system
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
okay i fell into that thinking i was
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to save my family money and let me
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
tell you right now i might have saved
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
107 a month but it's not what they told
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
me it was going to do
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i got 30 panels on my house that's
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
totally different off a carbon so what
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to tell you is that
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
this is a feel good
 
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
this is a feel good
legislation

01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
and this here
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
this house resolution makes a difference
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
on telling the federal government enough
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
is enough on redistributing people's
 
01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.669 align:start position:0%
is enough on redistributing people's
money

01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
and this is the first step in the right
 
01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
and this is the first step in the right
direction

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%

so
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
my knowledge of the conflict
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
i don't feel comfortable
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
picking aside in the israeli-palestinian
 
01:52:37.679 --> 01:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
picking aside in the israeli-palestinian
conflict

01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does it reaffirms
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
our strong support for the jewish people
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
and our truest ally in the middle east
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
the nation of israel but it also adds
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire general court
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes the right of the palestinian
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
people to exist and it also says that we
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
support the israeli palestinian peace
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
process i think we can all agree that
 
01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:57.669 align:start position:0%
process i think we can all agree that
peace

01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
peace
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
should be the solution uh should be the
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
final resolution in the
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
the the middle east uh we want peace uh
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
and and i think we can all agree on that
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't think it's our place to be
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
picking a side in this conflict at least
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
with the china house resolution it's a
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
authoritarian country oppressing these
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%

don't feel the need to uh intercede in
that

01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%

uh do you recognize representative chase
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so um the way i'm i'm reading this
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is are you are you replacing
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the original resolution lines two
 
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:42.870 align:start position:0%
on the original resolution lines two
through

01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
eight with what the amendment is uh
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
lines seven through fourteen so line
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
seven through fourteen of the amendment
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
is replacing lines two through eight of
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
the current resolution
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
i i also forgot to add thank you for
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
bringing that up uh
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
my knowledge of the conflict in the the
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
middle east
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
in israel palestine is
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh the moving of the embassy and that
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
was the most controversial part in my
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
eyes of the resolution and it simply
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
strikes that part and and then enters uh
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
these new sections about the uh right of
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
the palestinian people to exist
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
and uh the peace process that we support
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
representatives um yeah it wasn't really
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
a question um i didn't realize i was
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
even asking a question but i appreciate
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
that you answered my question but um so
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just gonna speak to the amendment if
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's okay am i allowed to do that
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um and thank you
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
for answering my questions still though
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
it was intended as a question i just
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
didn't know if we're allowed to do that
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
during it's technically debated
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
you can okay just want to make sure i'm
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
following committee and house rules and
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
everything um
 
01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:45.270 align:start position:0%
everything um
so

01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think i think it's extreme you know i
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
your heart's in the right place
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative but i think it's
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
extremely important that the us and that
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
this this body this general court um
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed the us's current policy
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
towards israel right with the testimony
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
that we heard here uh yesterday just
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday from from someone who's part
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the general court who is a jewish
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
american who is one of our colleagues um
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
really explaining the history of why
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
israel exists really explaining the
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
plight of the jewish people really
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
explaining the second diaspora that
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
they've gone through with people going
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
back to their homeland or coming to
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
america i think it's important that this
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
body send a strong statement and really
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
support the nation of israel right
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
really support the historical capital of
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
jerusalem which is currently their
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
governing capital instead of having our
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
diplomats driving halfway across the
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
israeli nation to do their jobs and to
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
support the people of israel and i think
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's also important if it's also their
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
capital i mean i would i wouldn't want
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
the the jewish people the israeli state
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
to be saying that our you know that we
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
had a different capital somewhere else i
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't think that's fair at all we should
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
have common respect if they recognize
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
our capital we should recognize their
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
true capital and i think i just think
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
that when we get to the crux of this all
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're supporting the
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
israeli state just because we're
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
supporting the israeli state doesn't
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
mean that other members can't have their
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
own opinions on the conflict or other
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
people that they may support are also
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
involved in that conflict i just think
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is a um it's a good strong
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
statement the way it is i don't think
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment's necessary i think it
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
waters down our statement um i think
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
strong support for the israeli people in
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
the israeli nation is important now more
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
than ever especially when we've seen
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
terrorist attacks in our own country and
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
terrorist attacks in the middle east
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
against these people historically but
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
even just recently um i think we should
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
i think constituents expect this
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
especially with some of the anti-semitic
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
comments that have come from some of our
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
own colleagues in both parties and i've
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
been quite clear and denounced all those
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
comments to
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
jewish supporters jewish granite staters
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
to my own constituents i think i think
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
they um you know we're supposed to be
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
honorable and i think it's beneath our
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
titles in our office i think it means
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
that some some members have not reached
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
a mantle of our office so i hope
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
everyone can go on record in the house
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
and really um have to explain to their
 
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.830 align:start position:0%
and really um have to explain to their
constituents

01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
why they either agree strongly or
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
disagree with the current um the current
 
01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
as drafted language for
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
hcr7 and i think the amendment um i
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary in this
 
01:57:13.679 --> 01:57:15.030 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary in this
situation

01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%

uh very quickly
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
israel is the only democracy in that
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
part of the world
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
and israel represents what's right with
 
02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
the middle east not what's wrong with
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
the middle east
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
the embassy change has been supported
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
since the 1990s by both parties uh by
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
both republican and democrat
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
administrations the obama administration
 
02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.390 align:start position:0%
administrations the obama administration
supported

02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
supported
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh at least said they supported
 
02:00:53.119 --> 02:00:54.550 align:start position:0%
uh at least said they supported
the

02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
transfer of the embassy from tel aviv to
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
jerusalem but they just never took
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
action on it finally we did take action
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
and we backed up our words with action
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
and moved the embassy to
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
jerusalem and his representative desche
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
said i think we need to honor
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh we shouldn't decide
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
where we put our diplomatic people we
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
should honor the
 
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
wishes of the host country in terms of
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
where their capital is
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh and again this is a resolution that
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
allows us to send a message uh as we did
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
earlier in the historic tradition of
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
this body to occasionally send
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
messages on things that we feel are
 
02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:32.070 align:start position:0%
messages on things that we feel are
important

02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
like this and messages add up so i would
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
encourage you to vote otp in this
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
measure uh thank you representative
 
02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
measure uh thank you representative
representative

02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
dulimus thank you
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just wanted to say
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
that i i think i recall this being
 
02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:48.070 align:start position:0%
that i i think i recall this being
bipartisan

02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
i think i recall that that president
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
clinton uh had something to do with
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
wanting to move the capitol to jerusalem
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
and recognize jerusalem as the capital
 
02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:00.070 align:start position:0%
and recognize jerusalem as the capital
city

02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
city
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
for that nation and that
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
i don't see how this is a
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
a problem it's something that both sides
 
02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.109 align:start position:0%
a problem it's something that both sides
were

02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
good with doing
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
so that that was i just wanted to
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
reiterate that because i know that we're
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
aware that this that this was something
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
that both democrats and republicans
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
approved of in the past
 
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:23.010 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you representative
 
02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:24.310 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you representative
[Music]

02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm opposing this resolution i think
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's a great example of something that
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
we should not be considering
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
or weighing in on and i know our
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues disagree on this and i think
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
this resolution and the last resolution
 
02:02:42.239 --> 02:02:43.030 align:start position:0%
this resolution and the last resolution
are

02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
examples of issues of great import very
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
very complex issues
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.669 align:start position:0%
we're not
a

02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
experts in those subject matters
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's not the purview of this committee
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
and b
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
as a committee and as an institution as
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
the house we have no power over those
 
02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:02.870 align:start position:0%
the house we have no power over those
matters

02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
matters
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's a more overarching
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
problem with resolutions generally we
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
have these great debates in this
 
02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
committee and and on the house floor
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
about the merits of the issues
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
frankly it doesn't matter
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
this i think
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
though some
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
some folks may disagree with me
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
or at least say they disagree with me
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
realistically this resolution and the
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
other resolutions that we consider here
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
today are going to do nothing they're
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
not going to move the needle at all
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
no one will ever read them
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
and frankly i don't think it's again
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the committee
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
especially with regard to international
 
02:03:39.599 --> 02:03:41.189 align:start position:0%
especially with regard to international
affairs

02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house to weigh in on those
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
matters especially when they involve
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
very complex issues
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
and picking sides
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
on a very complex dispute so that's why
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to oppose this resolution
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh anyone else uh
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
um i can i can uh i can certainly see
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
the viewpoint of the uh of the good
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
gentleman from i believe nashua correct
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative piedra
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
manchester my apologies i can understand
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the sentiments of the gentleman
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
from manchester but i still think it's
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
important that this body
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
voice its opinion on how our federal
 
02:04:20.550 --> 02:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
government is handling international
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
affairs it affects all of our
 
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
constituents it affects our state within
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
this ever globalizing world and um i
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
think it's also important to like i said
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
after seeing some of the anti-semitic
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
statements from members of this general
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
court from both parties that um that we
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
show that as a body right that we
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we support the nation of israel and
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
um i think that's important i think it's
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
important that constituents see
 
02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:46.550 align:start position:0%
important that constituents see
how

02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh their representatives stand on this
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
issue after some of the things some of
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
the terrible things that have been said
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
in public or online statements and um
 
02:04:59.430 --> 02:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that this is a bill that um
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
that we can well this is a resolution
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
that we can get behind because all we're
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
doing is just reaffirming that the way
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
the current setup is uh with the nation
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
of israel the way that we currently
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
recognize their capital and have our
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
embassy there which has been of
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan consensus for the last nearly
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
30 years that the people who elected us
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
can see that we are reaffirming that
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
international policy of the us
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
government and i know we don't have
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
purview of that but this is the one way
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
we get to have a say in it right this is
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
the one way in any official capacity and
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
that's part of the responsibility of
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
this committee as state and federal
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
relations this is how we explain you
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
know this is this is our relationship
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
with the federal government this is the
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
committee that's responsible for
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
redressing the federal government of
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
this body's concerns and i think this is
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
a something that is important to the
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire that's important
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
to this committee and its purview even
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
if it's limited and only symbolic i
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
think it's also important that the
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire see that this
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
body is not ripe with anti-semitism that
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
the people here support any and all
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
people including including jewish people
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:14.239 --> 02:06:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%

02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned some uh representatives who
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
said anti-semitic statements and i need
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
to defend at least two of them because
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
they did not know that what they were
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
posting was considered anti-semitic
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
one of them um even wore a support
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
israel pin four terms ago which was
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
three terms before he was ever accused
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted that to be on record
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%

02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
bal disarro
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't the buck stop here i mean isn't
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
this the committee
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
that gets the ball rolling on this i
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
mean we're in a position
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
to go forward with some important
 
02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:04.229 align:start position:0%
to go forward with some important
legislation

02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
i mean if we keep putting this aside
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
us not having
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
privy to
 
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.149 align:start position:0%

it'll be stagnant and we'll get nowhere
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%

friends
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
about policy
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that they are
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
complicated and nuanced issues in the
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
middle east and i just want to separate
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
and urge people to separate
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
the ideas of anti-semitism
 
02:08:45.119 --> 02:08:46.229 align:start position:0%
the ideas of anti-semitism
and

02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
absolute support for israel
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
that there will be
 
02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
jewish legislators
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
who will say it's not such a good idea
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
to move
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
the capitol to jerusalem some say it
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
should be in tel aviv some say it should
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
be in jerusalem we will disagree with
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
this so i just want to say there isn't a
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
uniform jewish response
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
to this as we move forward independent
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%

are not absolutely elated and thrilled
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
that their capital has been moved to
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
where it was supposed to be moved
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
decades ago
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh representative hogan
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
chairman baldassaro first of all the
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
state of
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
israel is not a monolith there have as
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
many different opinions as many
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
different factions as
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
the united states or any other country
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
so not a unified entity and also not
 
02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
everyone who lives in israel is
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
is jewish and not and of course
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
most jews live outside israel and um
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
so the jewish people in the state of
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
israel are not the same thing and
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
certainly you're not necessarily
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
condemning either if you disagree with
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
some of the policies but the other
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
thing was we were
 
02:12:52.709 --> 02:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
generally from rochester said we have to
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
support just because of what
 
02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:56.069 align:start position:0%
support just because of what
clinton

02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
clinton
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
did when he was president which was uh
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
over 20 years a long time ago over 20
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
years ago and and or obama and you know
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
obama and clinton
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
may have been wrong about some things
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
which doesn't mean and just as uh
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
trump or
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
george george w bush or the elder bush
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
may not have also made mistakes that
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean you know we
 
02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
democrats are not necessarily obligated
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
to replicate every
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
error that
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
obama or clinton made or also or even al
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
gore whose name came up in an earlier
 
02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:28.390 align:start position:0%
gore whose name came up in an earlier
bill

02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
and just as like you're not obligated to
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
replicate every mistake that trump or
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
the bushes or other republicans have
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
made so that
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're not locked into position just
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
because of what a former democratic
 
02:13:41.669 --> 02:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
president made so thanks
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%

a few years ago we passed this out of

committee here and uh i thought it was a
 
02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:37.669 align:start position:0%
committee here and uh i thought it was a
great

02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh bill telling the united kingdom there

right to do the right thing there and
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
saving the position in new hampshire is
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%

your amendment uh sure uh yes um
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
so this amendment all it's doing is
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
changing the um
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
effective date on it because i missed
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
this um when it was originally drafted
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
and there the original um
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
effective date was july 1st 2022 and i
 
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
think that's pushing things
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
so all the the amendment does is move it
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%

side of the room about uh refugee
resettlement

02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
resettlement
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want it to become a political
 
02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
issue we don't want uh to un unjustly uh
 
02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
track these individuals and i talked to
 
02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill and
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that he is okay
 
02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh in that this can get us a lot more
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
votes on this bill and it makes it a lot
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
more unanimous i don't think it will be
 
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
unanimous but it gets us more votes in
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm a little confused on
 
02:35:34.389 --> 02:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
whether the prime minister was
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
in favor but you want to speak to that
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
yes it will um and i was in favor of of
 
02:35:42.389 --> 02:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
of this amendment to begin with but
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
after speaking with several of the
 
02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors last night and a number of
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
the the caucus members on our side um i
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
decided to be against this and move the
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
language forward the way it is
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's concern from these people that
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
this information is um will be useful in
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
identifying um for education purposes
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
and for
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
resource purposes for
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
um the state that you know what they're
 
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
from a budgetary standpoint so
 
02:36:14.399 --> 02:36:15.190 align:start position:0%
from a budgetary standpoint so
um

02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:17.429 --> 02:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be against this amendment
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%

02:36:22.950 --> 02:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
already one sec uh did you have your
 
02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i
 
02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:29.429 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i
um

02:36:29.429 --> 02:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
because i was not even on the hearing
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
for this bill and i just saw this
 
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
amendment a second ago i
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i think general idea is good i'm
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
not sure in the original bill what a
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
federal foreign relocation since from my
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
usually refugees they're made into the
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
country and then it's usually private
 
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:49.030 align:start position:0%
country and then it's usually private
private

02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
private
 
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
organizations who actually handle the
 
02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of relocating them and
 
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
finding a place to live so um
 
02:36:58.710 --> 02:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm still kind of fuzzy so i'm just
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
fuzzy about like whether this would have
 
02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
the desired effect if we left it in
 
02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
since but
 
02:37:08.309 --> 02:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you uh the branch you
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
made the motion on that octopus who made
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
huh

02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
huh
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative massimilia okay yeah she
 
02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
was the second
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
okay representative moffatt
 
02:37:24.150 --> 02:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you miss chair so i if i could
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
ask the uh sponsor of this amendment to
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
just very quickly once he once again uh
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
explained this and i ask this again just
 
02:37:34.469 --> 02:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
so i understand uh partly because i i
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
vote first and
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
and uh we we didn't have a chance to
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
talk about this in caucus and i note
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
that representative foster the sponsor
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
was for it and now he's kind of leaned
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
against it so
 
02:37:49.349 --> 02:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh if you could just take a few moments
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
and once again just
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
clearly explain
 
02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
your amendment and the intent
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
so as the bill is currently written it
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
asks the federal government to share
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
information on the total number of
 
02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state it has permanent
 
02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
staff assigned in the state temporary
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
staff surveillance operations currently
 
02:38:12.389 --> 02:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
going on in the state federal
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
investigations warrants served no knock
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
warrants served in federal arrests those
 
02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
are all things i agree with
 
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment simply strikes the last
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
data point that we're asking the federal
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
government to share with us about
 
02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:26.950 align:start position:0%
government to share with us about
foreign

02:38:26.950 --> 02:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
refugee relocations in new hampshire
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
i i just am concerned that
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
that number will be used as a political
 
02:38:34.399 --> 02:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
that number will be used as a political
football

02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
football
 
02:38:37.030 --> 02:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
in elections
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
unduly trafficking tracking these
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
individuals when we're trying to
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
integrate them into our society
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
and i i that's my one concern with the
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill as currently written
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any uh more
 
02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:53.190 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any uh more
discussion

02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
um i i of course support i'll be posing
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment myself uh
 
02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.110 align:start position:0%
the amendment myself uh
but

02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh because i support basically what you
 
02:39:03.990 --> 02:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
said in the responses and co-sponsors
 
02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:04.870 align:start position:0%
said in the responses and co-sponsors
there

02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
on the uh the bill there because there's
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
issues here i think it's very important
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the uh cities and towns to know uh
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
what's been coming going on in their
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh cities and towns it makes a big
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
difference on their uh how much money
 
02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
they got to raise their taxes on for
 
02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:21.190 align:start position:0%
they got to raise their taxes on for
education

02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay or for services and other things
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
there so we owe it to the taxpayers to
 
02:39:29.590 --> 02:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that it's transparent
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i just wanted to say um
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
the point is transparency and it's just
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
a number um i couldn't see how it could
 
02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
become a uh a
 
02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
political football personally i mean you
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
know i think it's good to know how many
 
02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
for example and it's something that is
 
02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
even reported in the press too right i
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
mean we saw what was it was it 50 um
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
afghani uh refugees who fought alongside
 
02:39:55.270 --> 02:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
u.s soldiers on a you know a
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
two-decade-long mission who are
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
relocated here i think it's good for
 
02:39:59.750 --> 02:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of information to be published
 
02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
today who of our allies are coming back
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
to this country and are going to be um
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know assimilated into our society i
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
think it's um this is just asking for a
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
certain amount of transparency and we
 
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
also can't forget too if the federal
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
agency wants to they can just say no if
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
they feel as if it could violate some
 
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
amount of privacy of the of the refugees
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
being sent here but even still um
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's just a number and you know i would
 
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
i would hope people would understand you
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
know what what it takes to uh to be re
 
02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
resettled into this country as a refugee
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh the extensive process specifically
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
and what we've just seen with afghani
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
refugees who you know quite literally
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
defended u.s soldiers on foreign soil so

02:48:58.950 --> 02:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that have policing
 
02:48:58.960 --> 02:48:59.830 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that have policing
power

02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
power
 
02:49:02.469 --> 02:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
and to take all that information and put
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
it into a single place where the
 
02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state can look and see
 
02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:07.830 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state can look and see
it

02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:08.630 align:start position:0%
it
and

02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:11.349 --> 02:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
get rid of
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
some of the speculation as to what's
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
happening and what what agencies are
 
02:49:15.359 --> 02:49:16.150 align:start position:0%
happening and what what agencies are
doing

02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
and to give people a better
 
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of what our federal
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
government is doing here in new
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire to try to improve state and
 
02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:27.680 align:start position:0%

that and that is seven
 
02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
no next chairman hr
 
02:52:36.550 --> 02:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.870 --> 02:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay there's no amendment
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
all right we're on uh hr i'm going to
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
open up the executive session on h.r 18
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
and representative lundgren you had a
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
all right there's a motion on the itl
 
02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
and i'll second that
 
02:52:59.030 --> 02:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
 
02:52:59.040 --> 02:52:59.990 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
motion

02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes i just think we're overstepping our
 
02:53:07.349 --> 02:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:09.030 --> 02:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any other
 
02:53:15.030 --> 02:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:16.469 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
would like to speak in opposition to the
 
02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
itl motion to hr18
 
02:53:23.910 --> 02:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think that when the 13th amendment did
 
02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:25.110 align:start position:0%
i think that when the 13th amendment did
pass

02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:53:27.349 --> 02:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
having this exception in
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
pass stricter laws to put people in
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
prison to use as slave labor as we heard
 
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
in the testimony yesterday
 
02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
some of these states were
 
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
introducing the black code
 
02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
to to arrest recently freed slaves and
 
02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
putting them back into slavery and then
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
selling that slave labor to the
 
02:53:54.469 --> 02:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
plantations that they had just been
 
02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
freed from
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
i i believe that this was uh intentional
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
when the 13th amendment was passed and i
 
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
think it's time that we asked the
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
congress to
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
remove that exception from the 13th
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
amendment i i know that probably won't
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
happen but
 
02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
i think that our state should be taking
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
a stand against slave labor
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
i know in california
 
02:54:18.230 --> 02:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday a question was brought up
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
about qualifications given to these
 
02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
prisoners uh doing slave labor and the
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
example that comes to the top of my mind
 
02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:26.870 align:start position:0%
example that comes to the top of my mind
is

02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
california forcing prisoners to fight
 
02:54:29.279 --> 02:54:30.710 align:start position:0%
california forcing prisoners to fight
wildfires

02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
wildfires
 
02:54:32.830 --> 02:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
but when they are freed from
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
prison they do not have the
 
02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:36.309 align:start position:0%
prison they do not have the
qualifications

02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
to become a firefighter and they have
 
02:54:38.950 --> 02:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
the criminal background that prevents
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
them from becoming a firefighter so
 
02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
we're putting these prisoners
 
02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
in harm's way trying to to fight these
 
02:54:49.510 --> 02:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
fires and we're not even giving them the
 
02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications to fight these fi fight
 
02:54:54.309 --> 02:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
the fires after the release from prison
 
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that there's a lot of issues
 
02:54:58.790 --> 02:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the current uh 13th amendment and
 
02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
that we should close the loophole so
 
02:55:03.269 --> 02:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
that there is no slave labor in the
 
02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
united states
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you is there anyone else that
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on this bill
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'll be more than happy to do it
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
i i support the itl and the reason why i
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
mean you talk about firemen
 
02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
i wasn't a fireman either i fought many
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
fires in floods in california
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
okay and got my regular minecore salary
 
02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
as a marine
 
02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
many volunteers fight fires and help out
 
02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
and everything else we're talking
 
02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:31.590 align:start position:0%
and everything else we're talking
prisoners

02:55:31.590 --> 02:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
prisoners
 
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking people have done that done
 
02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
we're talking people have done that done
crime

02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
crime
 
02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:35.830 align:start position:0%
crime
so

02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be easy on crime and
 
02:55:40.230 --> 02:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
try to be nice because you go to jail
 
02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden we want you to
 
02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
just sit there maybe collect the sun for
 
02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
the next four six twenty or your
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
lifetime hang out in the sun
 
02:55:48.950 --> 02:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
let's give you a fair wage but we're
 
02:55:51.349 --> 02:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
gonna cost the taxpayers uh feed you
 
02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay board you uh and uh put you on you
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
know room and board
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
um in money for everything else for your
 
02:56:00.230 --> 02:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
while you're in prison that's what this
 
02:56:01.349 --> 02:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
is about
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's slavery we use slavery here i'm
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
called a racist every two years when i
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
run for state rep
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay and yet you know
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're so easy to throw out that word
 
02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:13.190 align:start position:0%
we're so easy to throw out that word
slavery

02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
slavery
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
you know because you've done the crime
 
02:56:16.710 --> 02:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
there so let's pat him on the back you
 
02:56:18.389 --> 02:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
know maybe give him a cushion a mattress
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
or something like that and maybe let him
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
get the sun tanning lotion or something
 
02:56:24.469 --> 02:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
i don't understand this here why we
 
02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
would not support something like this
 
02:56:29.590 --> 02:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
here on the itl uh why we were saying
 
02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we're treating prisoners as slaves
 
02:56:34.790 --> 02:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
do you want them to sit around
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
i mean this just makes no sense to me
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry new hampshire has a reputation
 
02:56:41.429 --> 02:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
you do the time you do the crime and
 
02:56:43.349 --> 02:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
then they should be paying for their uh
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know restitution and they should be
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
paying for their stay in prison they did
 
02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
the crime not the people are the victims
 
02:56:53.590 --> 02:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that thank you
 
02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%

yeah i'll be brief i mean we i committee
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know for people that weren't in
 
03:00:13.349 --> 03:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
committee yesterday committee asked me
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
questions for probably about 27 minutes
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
straight and um but they were good and
 
03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
it was a great stimulating conversation
 
03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
many of us sat here
 
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
for three hours
 
03:00:24.790 --> 03:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
and listen to testimony but what we have
 
03:00:25.990 --> 03:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
to remember about the testimony that we
 
03:00:28.230 --> 03:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday is the constitutional
 
03:00:30.309 --> 03:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
ramifications were not touched even the
 
03:00:31.750 --> 03:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
people who did the mental gymnastics
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
regarding how the economic and the
 
03:00:37.110 --> 03:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
logistical situation could be remedied
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we have to we took
 
03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
an oath to the u.s constitution to the
 
03:00:43.830 --> 03:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
state constitution that oath recognizes
 
03:00:45.429 --> 03:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
by taking that oath to both
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
constitutions and with both
 
03:00:48.870 --> 03:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
constitutions recognizing uh joint
 
03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
sovereignty over issues in this country
 
03:00:54.309 --> 03:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense for us to be
 
03:00:57.269 --> 03:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
violating that oath as a as a as
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
legislators there's also
 
03:01:02.230 --> 03:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
then you know people supporting this we
 
03:01:04.230 --> 03:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
enter into a very gray area regarding
 
03:01:06.230 --> 03:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not that is rebellion and
 
03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not that is uh that's grounds
 
03:01:10.710 --> 03:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
for removal from office which is a very
 
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
scary thing to think about um it's
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
something that would disenfranchise
 
03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
voters it's something that is uh to me
 
03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's a um you know should we really be
 
03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
forcing not only the us constitution
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
into a uh
 
03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
into you know disarray but should we
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
also be forcing this body into a
 
03:01:29.190 --> 03:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
situation where we have to start asking
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
the question should a legislator be
 
03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
sitting um within this body and you know
 
03:01:36.309 --> 03:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
we discussed that at length yesterday
 
03:01:37.510 --> 03:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
i think i think the constitutional
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
argument against it was quite sound i
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
think the argument that was brought
 
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
forward by members of the committee was
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
quite sound and i don't think anyone who
 
03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
testified yesterday in favor could
 
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
properly address that other than if they
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
believe that the u.s constitution is um
 
03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
has no legal authority which it quite
 
03:01:57.030 --> 03:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
clearly does the us constitution is the
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
utmost legal authority in this country
 
03:02:02.309 --> 03:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
so with that i would encourage every
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislator on this committee to um to
 
03:02:06.230 --> 03:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
encourage the body to recommend to the
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
body that we unanimously um strike down
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
cacr 32 right because we've we embarked
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
on a constitutional process starting
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
with the introduction of this and the
 
03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:16.389 align:start position:0%
with the introduction of this and the
hearing

03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:02:18.150 --> 03:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
and um this is when we now enter into
 
03:02:20.870 --> 03:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
the constitutional situation of
 
03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know what happens if legislators
 
03:02:24.230 --> 03:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
support this and i would i would hope
 
03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
that that's just not a question we even
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
have to address at any point in any time
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
going forward thank you
 
03:02:33.910 --> 03:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you know i i i'm just gonna
 
03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:34.710 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you know i i i'm just gonna
add

03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
add
 
03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
i i agree with this here carl you know
 
03:02:40.150 --> 03:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
but the thing is why i'm not supporting
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
it is because there's no plan what
 
03:02:42.870 --> 03:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
happens after
 
03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in place here what
 
03:02:46.550 --> 03:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
happens to our elderly what happens to
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
the working people what happens to the
 
03:02:49.990 --> 03:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
people are paid in social security what
 
03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
happens if people work in massachusetts
 
03:02:54.150 --> 03:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
what happens to the military
 
03:02:56.309 --> 03:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
on our borders with the air the tankers
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
what are
 
03:02:59.590 --> 03:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
national support that we have with our
 
03:03:01.110 --> 03:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
military here
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
on the equipment that was sent to us
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
paid by the federal government there's
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
no plan
 
03:03:07.349 --> 03:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah we all believe many of us
 
03:03:08.469 --> 03:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
believe the federal government is a
 
03:03:10.309 --> 03:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
little out of control but we're
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
fortunate no because new hampshire is
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
fortunate for many years standing up on
 
03:03:16.469 --> 03:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
their own we don't have a sales tax we
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
have a property tax we kicked back we
 
03:03:20.469 --> 03:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
went against the federal government on
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana we went we're the only
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
state in the country without a seat belt
 
03:03:24.319 --> 03:03:25.110 align:start position:0%
state in the country without a seat belt
law

03:03:25.110 --> 03:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
we don't we want to get you know on the
 
03:03:28.469 --> 03:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
federal government beliefs on riding
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
motorcycles with helmets that's right so
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
we do fight them you know uh the federal
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
government but there's no plan how do we
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
put this together
 
03:03:39.429 --> 03:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
no nothing do we throw grandma out of
 
03:03:40.950 --> 03:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes now because we can't
 
03:03:42.230 --> 03:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
afford it
 
03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm saying i mean think
 
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing here
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i honestly when i'm dreaming at
 
03:03:50.070 --> 03:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
night i think it's a great idea but when
 
03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
i wake up and come back to reality
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
i realize that there's just no damn way
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
general stocks rolling over in his grave
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
that fought for america not just for new
 
03:03:59.279 --> 03:04:00.790 align:start position:0%
that fought for america not just for new
hampshire

03:04:00.790 --> 03:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay and i'll leave it at that but
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative you have something
 
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes if we
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
if we uh if we secede even though we
 
03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
still the state constitution we we're
 
03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
not protected by anything in federal law
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
the federal constitution so you know
 
03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:15.030 align:start position:0%
the federal constitution so you know
there's

03:04:15.030 --> 03:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:04:17.110 --> 03:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
no like with grandma in the nursing home
 
03:04:19.750 --> 03:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's uh no more medicare
 
03:04:22.469 --> 03:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
medicaid or medicare there's no federal
 
03:04:23.830 --> 03:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
highway funding there's no first
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
amendment no second amendment no 13th
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
amendment you know and
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
the list goes on and on so like we're
 
03:04:32.469 --> 03:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
not we're then not protected by anything
 
03:04:34.710 --> 03:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
that the federal government
 
03:04:36.870 --> 03:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
does that's actually good which is a lot
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
of things or we're not protected by
 
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
anything in the u.s constitution which
 
03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:41.750 align:start position:0%
anything in the u.s constitution which
uh

03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
and it's the u.s constitution is a lot
 
03:04:45.349 --> 03:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
harder to change because you have to get
 
03:04:45.359 --> 03:04:46.469 align:start position:0%
harder to change because you have to get
uh

03:04:46.469 --> 03:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:46.479 --> 03:04:47.190 align:start position:0%
uh
well

03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:04:49.349 --> 03:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
almost all 50 states i think 38 out of
 
03:04:52.790 --> 03:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
50 rather than just one but so
 
03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:53.750 align:start position:0%
50 rather than just one but so
um

03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's just a
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's just a very very risky thing to do
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
and also of course as a state we're not
 
03:05:01.269 --> 03:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
really prepared to go out and know as an
 
03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
independent nation anyway so
 
03:05:06.230 --> 03:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
those are as good of reasons as any to
 
03:05:09.110 --> 03:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
vote against this constitutional
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and of course also just
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
putting this in our constitution really
 
03:05:14.550 --> 03:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's unclear what legal effect that
 
03:05:15.990 --> 03:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
would have
 
03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:17.349 align:start position:0%
would have
whether

03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
that the we can't necessarily guarantee
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
the other 49 states or the federal
 
03:05:23.910 --> 03:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
government who just go along with it so
 
03:05:25.030 --> 03:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing in the u.s
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
constitution that allows the session
 
03:05:28.230 --> 03:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
anyway so
 
03:05:28.240 --> 03:05:29.349 align:start position:0%
anyway so
it's

03:05:29.349 --> 03:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative shakes yeah i just want
 
03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
to point out um uh
 
03:05:36.870 --> 03:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
three things real briefly thing number
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
one is by adding a subsection a the
 
03:05:41.590 --> 03:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
subsection a that they propose it uh it
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
directly conflicts with what the uh with
 
03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
what article seven part one of the new
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire state constitution already
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
says it says that we recognize the u.s
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
constitution and the congress and its
 
03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
authority right now we're adding a
 
03:05:55.990 --> 03:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
subsection a and in that subsection a it
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
directly conflicts so all of a sudden we
 
03:05:59.590 --> 03:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
have two parts of the same article of
 
03:06:01.510 --> 03:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
our state constitution that is in direct
 
03:06:02.710 --> 03:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
confliction with each other that's the
 
03:06:04.389 --> 03:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
first thing the second thing is i'm
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
gonna i agree with the um representative
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
horrigan's kind of his sentiments but i
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
disagree with how he's characterizing
 
03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
them because secession is not a
 
03:06:14.950 --> 03:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional authority of any
 
03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislator in this body um no state
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
kansas city no state ever seceded
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
according to the legal presence
 
03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
established by the supreme court after
 
03:06:25.990 --> 03:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
the civil war right that's quite clear
 
03:06:29.190 --> 03:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
in white v texas 1869 no state ever
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
seceded there were pro-union governments
 
03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
that kept running the actual legitimate
 
03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
governments of southern states during
 
03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
during rebellion right because we're
 
03:06:40.070 --> 03:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
calling this a session how it's legally
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
recognized is that they were in
 
03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
rebellion and the last thing is the u.s
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
supreme court does recognize rebellion
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
as also being a peaceful process right
 
03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
dennis versus u.s 1951 the chair of the
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
communist party could not run and stand
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
for government or get elected for
 
03:06:57.030 --> 03:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
government even because he supported he
 
03:06:58.950 --> 03:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
supported rebellion against the u.s
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
constitution and its legitimate
 
03:07:03.269 --> 03:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
government so um
 
03:07:05.910 --> 03:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is a um this this amendment this is
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
the first time um actually we you know
 
03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
this is a historical moment believe it
 
03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
or not because this is the first time
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
that any state legislature has discussed
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
in any committee or legislative body
 
03:07:17.200 --> 03:07:18.309 align:start position:0%
in any committee or legislative body
a

03:07:18.309 --> 03:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:07:18.319 --> 03:07:19.670 align:start position:0%
a
binding

03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
binding
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
binding secession right other things
 
03:07:23.349 --> 03:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
that you see on the news regarding
 
03:07:25.030 --> 03:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
secession like for example in texas or
 
03:07:26.710 --> 03:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
even vermont from time to time does it
 
03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
those are non-binding you know
 
03:07:31.349 --> 03:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
resolutions right similar to our hr's or
 
03:07:32.230 --> 03:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know our house concurrent
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
resolutions those are non-binding
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
they're symbolic this
 
03:07:37.349 --> 03:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
this is binding
 
03:07:39.269 --> 03:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
right and so this is actually the last
 
03:07:42.070 --> 03:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
people who debated such a binding
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
resolution were people who rebelled and
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
took up arms against the u.s
 
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
constitution and the federal government
 
03:07:51.269 --> 03:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
right the confederacy and to me um i
 
03:07:53.670 --> 03:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
think it deserves a resounding
 
03:07:56.230 --> 03:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
no i think uh governor sununu says it
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
quite well right when you hear crazy
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
knocking at the door you slam it shut
 
03:08:03.990 --> 03:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
this is crazy
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is unconstitutional this is a
 
03:08:07.750 --> 03:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
violation of our oath
 
03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
violation of our oath
um

03:08:08.550 --> 03:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:10.230 --> 03:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
i wish that some of the folks who had
 
03:08:11.910 --> 03:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
introduced this had thought more in
 
03:08:14.550 --> 03:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
depth and consulted with legal scholars
 
03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
consulted with you know
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
experts on this issue but um it to me
 
03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's just quite clear after
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
speaking to numerous legal scholars
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
after sitting down and preparing for the
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
hearing for an hour with the legal
 
03:08:29.190 --> 03:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
scholar who's you know internationally
 
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
renowned for helping secessionist
 
03:08:33.349 --> 03:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
movements and people in rebellion form
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
constitutions and um in our
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional system
 
03:08:41.269 --> 03:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
there is no way for us to have secession
 
03:08:42.630 --> 03:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
right secession is not something that
 
03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
can be entertained rebellion against the
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution is not allowed and even
 
03:08:50.870 --> 03:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
legislators peacefully proposing such is
 
03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
still a form of rebellion and now we
 
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
enter into the gray area of
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
if someone is supporting such a measure
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
then what what is our job do we have to
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
enforce the 14th amendment section 3
 
03:09:07.349 --> 03:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
right and to not think that someone you
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
know in either party is going to maybe
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
go after someone else in the other party
 
03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
for possibly violating their
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional oath um i think i think
 
03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
it would be um
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think it would almost be a little bit
 
03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
ignorant not to assume that right so i
 
03:09:25.269 --> 03:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
think people need to be cognizant of
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
that that this could have it could it
 
03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
could end up turning into a political
 
03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:30.550 align:start position:0%
could end up turning into a political
mess

03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
mess
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
where our house is having to really
 
03:09:33.910 --> 03:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
decide you know setting essentially a
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
legal precedent for this state of um of
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
what happens uh by supporting this and i
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't think that's something that
 
03:09:43.269 --> 03:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
we want fellow members in our house to
 
03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
have to deal with
 
03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:45.590 align:start position:0%
have to deal with
so

03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:48.790 --> 03:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh with that i i'll i'll yield my time
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh you know most people
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
that don't
 
03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
that you know testify on this stuff here
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
don't even read the constitution and i i
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
wish they would uh educate themselves
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
more on the constitution they just go
 
03:10:02.950 --> 03:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
off the wall and wow this sounds great
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
let's let's do that and it's really not
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
constitutionally right to be able to
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
move forward with something like this
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
sounds good
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean i think it's a
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
great mr mr chair i mean when i was in
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
high school i always thought it was a
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
cool concept but then i went to college
 
03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
and now i'm a legislator and i learned
 
03:10:22.710 --> 03:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
about the constitution the ramifications
 
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i said
 
03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's just not plausible and if you're a
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
military guy of course your vote never
 
03:10:30.070 --> 03:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
expired now you took during the military
 
03:10:31.830 --> 03:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
to defend the country foreign and
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
domestic you know i mean so uh
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else representing the branch
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair even if we entertain
 
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
this idea
 
03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
it would be in conflict to another
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
section i believe it's the same section
 
03:10:48.229 --> 03:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire constitution that
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
says we are part of the united states so
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
we would have one section that says we
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
are part of the united states and then
 
03:10:56.070 --> 03:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
another section that says we're not even
 
03:10:58.389 --> 03:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
if we entertain this idea it does not
 
03:11:00.229 --> 03:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
i agree matter of fact something i
 
03:11:03.590 --> 03:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
didn't even think about we take our oath
 
03:11:05.429 --> 03:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
and in the constitution we take the oath
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in the u.s uh
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
america we take a duel out right
 
03:11:15.110 --> 03:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
oh representative foster
 
03:11:20.710 --> 03:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to go on the record um
 
03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is probably one of the hardest
 
03:11:24.630 --> 03:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
votes i've made it's not easy for me
 
03:11:24.640 --> 03:11:25.830 align:start position:0%
votes i've made it's not easy for me
um

03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:28.389 --> 03:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
because when i came in here yesterday
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
and i saw the people that were
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
standing up to to do this and now it's a
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
small minority within our society
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
many of those people were
 
03:11:41.670 --> 03:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know they're not
 
03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
they don't share the same views i share
 
03:11:46.710 --> 03:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
they don't share the same
 
03:11:49.750 --> 03:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
things that i share but
 
03:11:53.830 --> 03:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
when i looked at that i didn't look and
 
03:11:56.469 --> 03:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
see a group of people who were bad or
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
evil who who we needed to shut up or put
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
down and i do see in our society a trend
 
03:12:02.960 --> 03:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
down and i do see in our society a trend
when

03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:12:06.710 --> 03:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
we have our neighbors who disagree with
 
03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
we have our neighbors who disagree with
us

03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
on certain issues whether they be
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
political and so forth
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
to push them down to say
 
03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
no we don't even want to hear from you
 
03:12:17.910 --> 03:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
either but they had an opportunity to
 
03:12:19.670 --> 03:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
speak yesterday
 
03:12:19.680 --> 03:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
speak yesterday
um

03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:23.349 --> 03:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
i also didn't come at this from the
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
angle of fear so
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
yeah you could be called the traitor
 
03:12:31.269 --> 03:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's unconstitutional that would
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
be for courts to decide there's a whole
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
bunch of constitutional issues and so
 
03:12:34.640 --> 03:12:35.590 align:start position:0%
bunch of constitutional issues and so
forth

03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
forth
 
03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:37.030 align:start position:0%
forth
um

03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:39.269 align:start position:0%
um
but

03:12:39.269 --> 03:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
i trust
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
i mean if i was to vote
 
03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of of moving this forward i
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
would trust that my neighbors would make
 
03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
good decisions and i don't think i do
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
not see 7 out of 10 or approximately 7
 
03:12:55.349 --> 03:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
out of 10 of my neighbors voting for
 
03:12:57.429 --> 03:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
this because like you said
 
03:12:59.429 --> 03:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
there is no plan
 
03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
and that's what deeply concerns me here
 
03:13:02.479 --> 03:13:05.429 align:start position:0%
and that's what deeply concerns me here
it

03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
they have an idea and they have very
 
03:13:11.670 --> 03:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate fears and concerns
 
03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:12.710 align:start position:0%
legitimate fears and concerns
that

03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
their rights may be getting taken away
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
that their voice may be getting silenced
 
03:13:18.960 --> 03:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
that their voice may be getting silenced
and

03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:20.630 align:start position:0%
and
so

03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
in in
 
03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
in reality
 
03:13:26.229 --> 03:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
the actions taken to silence those
 
03:13:29.110 --> 03:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
people probably brought this resolution
 
03:13:31.429 --> 03:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
forward but it is binding and that
 
03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
concerns me too when there's no real
 
03:13:38.309 --> 03:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:39.670 --> 03:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
i could
 
03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
vote to kick it to my neighbors and say
 
03:13:44.469 --> 03:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
here what do you guys want to do what do
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
you think you know um
 
03:13:47.359 --> 03:13:49.110 align:start position:0%
you think you know um
but

03:13:49.110 --> 03:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:13:50.070 --> 03:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
i would
 
03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
in reality rather see
 
03:13:53.830 --> 03:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
something brought if
 
03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
the condition can persists and and
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
something um you know and or worsens
 
03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:00.550 align:start position:0%
something um you know and or worsens
okay

03:14:00.550 --> 03:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:14:00.560 --> 03:14:02.150 align:start position:0%
okay
the

03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:03.429 --> 03:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
the fear
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
that is involved here
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
the overreach of our federal government
 
03:14:10.950 --> 03:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
which drives this whole thing
 
03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
is it going to get worse i don't know i
 
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
can't predict that
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay are we going to marginalize groups
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
of people
 
03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:18.389 align:start position:0%
of people
that

03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't share our views or maybe have
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
orientations or whatever you know are we
 
03:14:29.830 --> 03:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
gonna marginalize those people because
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
they don't agree with us
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
i don't wanna ever do that i want all
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
people to have a voice
 
03:14:39.269 --> 03:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
but at the same time
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
if there's no plan to it it's very
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous it's like taking a leap
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
without having a plan of how you're
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
going to land
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
03:14:50.309 --> 03:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:14:52.710 --> 03:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
i have a very difficult choice here
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
because i want to support
 
03:14:59.269 --> 03:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
liberty and i want to support
 
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
people's rights
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
but at the same time
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're at a point yet where
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
03:15:10.630 --> 03:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
withdraw from our federal government and
 
03:15:14.710 --> 03:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
if we do we need a plan to do so so
 
03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:15.429 align:start position:0%
if we do we need a plan to do so so
i

03:15:15.429 --> 03:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
am not going to be voting in favor of
 
03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:19.429 align:start position:0%
am not going to be voting in favor of
this

03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:15:20.950 --> 03:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative is there
 
03:15:23.030 --> 03:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
representing the branch
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
sorry i i've been talking a lot today
 
03:15:26.790 --> 03:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
but i would like to echo a lot of the
 
03:15:30.229 --> 03:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
points of representative foster uh
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
i i agreed with a lot of what was said
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
at yesterday's hearing about you know
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
the war on drugs and
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
occupations of other countries and
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
killing innocent civilians in other
 
03:15:41.670 --> 03:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
countries there's a lot that i disagree
 
03:15:43.830 --> 03:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
with the federal government on and and
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
the federal overreach on states issues
 
03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
i can agree with that and i can agree
 
03:15:51.190 --> 03:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
with some of the sentiment that they uh
 
03:15:53.670 --> 03:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
have expressed yesterday
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
i myself come from the immigrants of
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
people from quebec and i support the
 
03:16:01.030 --> 03:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
quebec independence movement and there's
 
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
a whole list of reason for why i support
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
that and the federal overreach of the
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
canadian government
 
03:16:06.960 --> 03:16:08.309 align:start position:0%
canadian government
but

03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
another aspect that i'd like the
 
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee to think about and as rep
 
03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:12.870 align:start position:0%
committee to think about and as rep
foster

03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
foster
 
03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
said i don't think that seven out of ten
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
of my neighbors would vote for this uh
 
03:16:20.469 --> 03:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a very small group and
 
03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
we have to consider the cost of having
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
03:16:26.710 --> 03:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
binding referendum uh this election
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
season because putting that question on
 
03:16:30.309 --> 03:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
the ballot and counting all those votes
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
does cost money to put on the ballot
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i would also think by sending
 
03:16:37.830 --> 03:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
this to the
 
03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:39.030 align:start position:0%
this to the
voters

03:16:39.030 --> 03:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
voters
 
03:16:39.040 --> 03:16:40.150 align:start position:0%
voters
that

03:16:40.150 --> 03:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
we would i myself would look incompetent
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the reason why i would feel i would
 
03:16:46.790 --> 03:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
look incompetent that i'm sending
 
03:16:49.750 --> 03:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
something that is not well thought out
 
03:16:51.510 --> 03:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we really never thought about a
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
plan like we said earlier on how to
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
implement this here
 
03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's just not there and i i honestly
 
03:17:01.190 --> 03:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
think i would look stupid to my concern
 
03:17:03.349 --> 03:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not running again so i don't care
 
03:17:04.950 --> 03:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
but i would think i would look like an
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
idiot because there's no plan everyone
 
03:17:09.429 --> 03:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
that was here really passionate
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i respected i knew a lot of them
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
that were out there i've been on the
 
03:17:16.150 --> 03:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
liberty side for 15 years but
 
03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
i rather have passed something that's
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
with something that's not
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and
 
03:17:24.630 --> 03:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
goes against everything that we stand
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
for and for all those veterans that died
 
03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
fighting for our freedom you know what i
 
03:17:31.830 --> 03:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
mean because general stock and all
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't just about new hampshire it was
 
03:17:35.910 --> 03:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
about the whole country they fought for
 
03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:36.710 align:start position:0%
about the whole country they fought for
so

03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
now leave it that representative yeah i
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
just want to point out one thing we're
 
03:17:43.349 --> 03:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
using the word referendum new hampshire
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't have referendums this is part of
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
a constitutional process you have to
 
03:17:51.910 --> 03:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
look at it we're running a race right
 
03:17:53.990 --> 03:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
and there's different mile you know
 
03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
there's different points that you reach
 
03:17:57.429 --> 03:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
in the race so you know you start the
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
race by introducing the bill right mile
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
one is the hearing mile two is here
 
03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
mile three
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
is um is the house floor mile four is
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
the senate floor mile five
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
is the people right kicking it back to
 
03:18:14.070 --> 03:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
them the people get to have the final
 
03:18:14.080 --> 03:18:14.870 align:start position:0%
them the people get to have the final
say

03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
but we by pushing when we push this
 
03:18:19.990 --> 03:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
along each mile right those who aid in
 
03:18:21.670 --> 03:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
that process are aiding and finishing
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
the race
 
03:18:24.389 --> 03:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
that's at least how i come at it from
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
the perspective and some constitutional
 
03:18:27.750 --> 03:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
scholars that i talk to there were some
 
03:18:29.910 --> 03:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
that said well maybe not necessarily
 
03:18:31.990 --> 03:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
because intent matters the bigger
 
03:18:34.389 --> 03:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
question and this is this is and this is
 
03:18:35.429 --> 03:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
the ultimate thing though that i'm
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
trying to get back to that i said
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
earlier is
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
we enter into this gray area right are
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
we going to consider intent when making
 
03:18:45.030 --> 03:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
a vote or outcome of making a vote right
 
03:18:47.190 --> 03:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
what is the outcome outcome of pushing
 
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
this forward or intent of well i
 
03:18:50.550 --> 03:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
intended to push this forward just
 
03:18:51.510 --> 03:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
because i thought it was a more
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
democratic process well we're not
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're pushing forward a constitutional
 
03:18:58.870 --> 03:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
process it's already embarked we're in
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
the middle of it we're right now we're
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
at the halfway point right after this
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
gets through this committee no matter
 
03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
we've gone half we've gone halfway i
 
03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
forgot about the senate committee the
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
senate committee will get this too so
 
03:19:11.670 --> 03:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's a six mile race but
 
03:19:14.229 --> 03:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
you know so i look at this and i say are
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
we going to be aiding and helping finish
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
this race of new hampshire secession
 
03:19:21.190 --> 03:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
or are we going to say no and adhere to
 
03:19:22.710 --> 03:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
the constitutional oath into the
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional precedence established
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the i think that's
 
03:19:28.389 --> 03:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing we have to consider
 
03:19:30.389 --> 03:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
and to think that there might not be
 
03:19:32.070 --> 03:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
members of the house that will turn this
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
into a political issue of saying someone
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
voted for secession now we're in this
 
03:19:37.510 --> 03:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
gray area and they need to be taken to
 
03:19:39.429 --> 03:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
court to find out whether or not that
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
was rebellion i think i i i hope members
 
03:19:44.309 --> 03:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
don't do that but that's a very
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
plausible possibility there's 400 people
 
03:19:48.630 --> 03:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
to not think that one in 400 people will
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
exploit this for a political reason
 
03:19:53.830 --> 03:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
i would you know it's the sad reality of
 
03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
politics so i would hope that people
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
really really think this through before
 
03:20:00.150 --> 03:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
they decide that they want to enter into
 
03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
a constitutional gray area into limbo of
 
03:20:06.070 --> 03:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
what what what is to happen going
 
03:20:08.070 --> 03:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
forward regarding the 14th amendment
 
03:20:10.229 --> 03:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
section 3. and that's all that's all i
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
have to say uh to finish
 
03:20:14.070 --> 03:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt
 
03:20:15.510 --> 03:20:15.520 align:start position:0%

03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%

03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes we did do a field trip matter of
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
fact i would have done it with this
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee but what i ended up doing was
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
a um zoom meeting and i brought in the
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%

03:39:23.349 --> 03:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
understand and know what process is to
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
help their constituents you know from
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
but anyways um i have a um an interim
 
03:39:32.070 --> 03:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
study motion by representative moffat
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
second by uh representative branch
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
and would you like to speak to your
 
03:39:37.750 --> 03:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
motion uh
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr briefly uh i
 
03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think many of us were uh conflicted by
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
the testimony that day there were some
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
very strong compelling arguments to
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
recognize the long service of this
 
03:39:50.800 --> 03:39:52.389 align:start position:0%
recognize the long service of this
gentleman

03:39:52.389 --> 03:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
gentleman
 
03:39:54.790 --> 03:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
but also there was not just one but
 
03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:56.389 align:start position:0%
but also there was not just one but
several

03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
several
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
individuals highly i think highly
 
03:40:01.110 --> 03:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
regarded individuals who
 
03:40:02.950 --> 03:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
did not support this
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i i think there's a need to reconcile
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
these two different uh perspectives on
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
so therefore i recommended interim study
 
03:40:16.150 --> 03:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
want to speak
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay i
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
represent marshmallow
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
um i i agree with uh representative
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
moffett um
 
03:40:30.229 --> 03:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
when i originally started the bill i was
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
in favor of it i read the resume that
 
03:40:38.229 --> 03:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
mr conway had provided and that seemed
 
03:40:38.239 --> 03:40:39.429 align:start position:0%
mr conway had provided and that seemed
impressive

03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
and then when i heard some testimony
 
03:40:42.239 --> 03:40:43.189 align:start position:0%
and then when i heard some testimony
about

03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
possible hostile work environment
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
that really concerned me
 
03:40:51.269 --> 03:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
so um i would agree interested
 
03:40:52.469 --> 03:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
i sponsored this bill on behalf of
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
executive council joe kenny asked me to
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
send it
 
03:40:59.910 --> 03:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
i've worked with barry conway for many
 
03:41:01.590 --> 03:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
many years
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i thought barry was utmost
 
03:41:04.239 --> 03:41:05.670 align:start position:0%
and i thought barry was utmost
professional

03:41:05.670 --> 03:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
professional
 
03:41:08.710 --> 03:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i was the bad guy
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
who stated when he was leaving to make
 
03:41:13.590 --> 03:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
sure that a veteran
 
03:41:15.189 --> 03:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
was put in the spot
 
03:41:17.269 --> 03:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
in that position and not somebody that
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
never served because i'm a true believer
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
in on ptsd tbi and other issues
 
03:41:25.750 --> 03:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
veterans communicate with other veterans
 
03:41:29.189 --> 03:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
for a veteran with ptsd or tb to go to a
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
ptsd to go to a civilian psychiatrist
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
that has no knowledge whatsoever on the
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
veteran community or going to combat
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of tough you know talking to
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
somebody like that they really don't
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
understand so
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
i was kind of shocked there on the um
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and i think representative
 
03:41:48.720 --> 03:41:49.910 align:start position:0%
testimony and i think representative
conroy

03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
conroy
 
03:41:49.920 --> 03:41:50.950 align:start position:0%
conroy
connor

03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
connor
 
03:41:52.389 --> 03:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
barry has a
 
03:41:55.110 --> 03:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
not representative but barry has a
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
a suit against uh
 
03:41:58.950 --> 03:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know on the way they treated him and
 
03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
what was said here because
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
for the many years i've been on this
 
03:42:04.150 --> 03:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee and been a chair before in a
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
vice chair before i've never heard of
 
03:42:07.349 --> 03:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
any of it
 
03:42:09.429 --> 03:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
never and i was in and out of the
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
veterans home barry done a lot for that
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
veterans home
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
matter of fact uh if anything the
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
numbers were kept up right now we're
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
about 100 and 203 in there when we have
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
bed space for 200.
 
03:42:24.389 --> 03:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay and i never heard no complaints or
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
anything about shot or workers or this
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
or that you know and reasons why they
 
03:42:28.960 --> 03:42:30.070 align:start position:0%
or that you know and reasons why they
couldn't

03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know versus i always heard why you
 
03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
you know versus i always heard why you
could

03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i'll support the interim study
 
03:42:37.110 --> 03:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
because i know the votes aren't there to
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
pass this here
 
03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
and i feel bad uh you know on this here
 
03:42:43.189 --> 03:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i think barry should go after them
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
because what was said in this committee
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
i thought was very unprofessional
 
03:42:49.830 --> 03:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay because there was no nothing logged
 
03:42:52.229 --> 03:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
in no they didn't bring anything it was
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
all hearsay or what they thought
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know or what one person said and
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
like i said i
 
03:43:01.269 --> 03:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
when the commandant made that comment
 
03:43:01.279 --> 03:43:02.070 align:start position:0%
when the commandant made that comment
there

03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
i was thinking to myself geez i'm the
 
03:43:05.110 --> 03:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
one that said the barry don't make sure
 
03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
you get a veteran
 
03:43:09.030 --> 03:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh to take over it's just my
 
03:43:11.429 --> 03:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
mentality as an old retired marine there
 
03:43:11.439 --> 03:43:12.469 align:start position:0%
mentality as an old retired marine there
so

03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:14.950 --> 03:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
um momentum study may be the right thing
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
to do since i don't want to see it itld
 
03:43:19.830 --> 03:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
it keeps it alive and then of course
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to come back next
 
03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
year if somebody's willing to step up
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
and do this for barry
 
03:43:26.710 --> 03:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
but in my opinion
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
barry is a very honorable guy
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
the national
 
03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
committeeman for the state of new
 
03:43:32.239 --> 03:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
committeeman for the state of new
hampshire

03:43:33.510 --> 03:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
assad major paul chevalier if anyone
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
knows him sent me a message was in
 
03:43:37.680 --> 03:43:38.790 align:start position:0%
knows him sent me a message was in
support

03:43:38.790 --> 03:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know barry he's worked with barry
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
for many years he was a committeeman for
 
03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
the bfw for many years
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
so that's why i was kind of shocked on
 
03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
what went on but i'll support the
 
03:43:50.550 --> 03:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
03:43:52.469 --> 03:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave it at that
 
03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes
 
03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh thank you mr chairman
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
most of the time naming bills come to
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
the public works and highways committee
 
03:44:02.150 --> 03:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we've learned over the years to be
 
03:44:04.630 --> 03:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
very cautious when there's controversy
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
and not move a bill forward if that
 
03:44:08.229 --> 03:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
makes anyone feel better to the point
 
03:44:10.630 --> 03:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
where if we're going to name a thing in
 
03:44:11.670 --> 03:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
a town
 
03:44:13.830 --> 03:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
we before we move the bill forward we
 
03:44:16.950 --> 03:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
will get a physical letter from the town
 
03:44:19.510 --> 03:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
saying that they approve of it so uh in
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
this case it sounds like there was
 
03:44:22.710 --> 03:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
controversy so
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
probably the best action to take is is
 
03:44:26.790 --> 03:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
if that makes anyone feel better about
 
03:44:30.790 --> 03:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
putting it off right without a doubt i
 
03:44:33.030 --> 03:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
agree and i've had my name on many
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
bridges naming after veterans that's who
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
i believe should be named after those
 
03:44:40.150 --> 03:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
veterans that died in that community
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
fighting for freedom just my opinion
 
03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:43.910 align:start position:0%
fighting for freedom just my opinion
okay

03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:46.870 --> 03:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
see anything else
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
seeing that there's no uh other
 
03:44:53.110 --> 03:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
information i'm gonna ask the clerk to
 
03:44:55.990 --> 03:44:56.000 align:start position:0%

is there a second
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:48.790 --> 03:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay and uh representative we have a
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%

uh by representative massa miller second
 
03:46:55.670 --> 03:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
by representative shea
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
and uh would you want to speak to your
 
03:46:58.790 --> 03:46:58.800 align:start position:0%

03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
the sponsor came forth and presented you
 
03:47:05.429 --> 03:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
know information about armistice day and
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth and when i was a
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
child veterans day was called armistice
 
03:47:13.269 --> 03:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
day and um just considering
 
03:47:15.269 --> 03:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
that with maybe a little bit more
 
03:47:17.349 --> 03:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
tweaking and stuff the bill would be
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
more amenable to various organizations
 
03:47:21.910 --> 03:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
recommending entrance study
 
03:47:24.319 --> 03:47:25.269 align:start position:0%
recommending entrance study
okay

03:47:25.269 --> 03:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:29.189 --> 03:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.199 --> 03:47:30.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:47:30.229 --> 03:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:32.150 --> 03:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to encourage my colleagues
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
and the majority of the committee to to
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
um to vote for interim study i think
 
03:47:38.309 --> 03:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
there is a way to to remedy this
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
possibly without um without it viewing
 
03:47:43.110 --> 03:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
as if we're taking away from veterans on
 
03:47:44.710 --> 03:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
such an important day there might be a
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
way to make it so that the state of new
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire also has official proclamation
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
for veterans day and also can recognize
 
03:47:53.110 --> 03:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
a uh the more you know the holiday
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
that's celebrated throughout the
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
commonwealth because both are very
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
honorable things that you know we do
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
internationally and nationally so i
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
think there's a way to really think this
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
through so
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
um i don't think the current language is
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know does any justice um properly
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
to either veterans day or armistice day
 
03:48:13.110 --> 03:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
so i think with some tweaks we can maybe
 
03:48:14.790 --> 03:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
reach some consensus with the veterans
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
community and other stakeholders
 
03:48:17.600 --> 03:48:19.110 align:start position:0%
community and other stakeholders
okay

03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
you know i've known representative
 
03:48:22.229 --> 03:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
shirtless for a long time very honorable
 
03:48:22.239 --> 03:48:23.110 align:start position:0%
shirtless for a long time very honorable
guy

03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
guy
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you uh veterans day is a day
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
to remember those that have served
 
03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
you know an act you know act of reserve
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
or in the past or whatever
 
03:48:33.120 --> 03:48:34.309 align:start position:0%
or in the past or whatever
um

03:48:34.309 --> 03:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
memorial day is the day that we
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
celebrate for those that have made the
 
03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
ultimate sacrifice and this was a tough
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
one here you know because the more and
 
03:48:43.830 --> 03:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
more i think of november 11th at 11
 
03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:45.030 align:start position:0%
more i think of november 11th at 11
o'clock

03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know whether it be called armistice
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
day one time remembrance day
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
um i just think veterans day should
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
continue now this does not mean that
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative shirtless or anyone else
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
could not go to the governor
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
and ask for a proclamation
 
03:49:01.990 --> 03:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh identify in remembrance day
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
for their districts you can do that
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
so you know it doesn't have to be um
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
muddy in the water with the ac you know
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
the people that uh survive you know live
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
and served in you know veterans day
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
versus memorial day so i think it's the
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
right decision to interim study it and
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
i'll definitely be supporting it
 
03:49:23.590 --> 03:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i'm gonna
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
put my
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
thing changed there i was gonna oppose
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
it because i part of me was on the fence
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
on it but
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm supporting
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything else anyone else
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
want to add anything to it and uh
 
03:49:40.070 --> 03:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
without okay so without that uh nobody
 
03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
else i am going to ask the clerk to take
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%

03:54:07.030 --> 03:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.150 --> 03:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
i have a thing dave is from londonderry
 
03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay what we do we have an ought to pass
 
03:54:36.070 --> 03:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
on an amendment wait let me get the
 
03:54:39.750 --> 03:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
emotion where who's doing the motion
 
03:54:43.269 --> 03:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:47.110 --> 03:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
i make a motion uh to approve amendment
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
1280 hb 1284
 
03:54:51.910 --> 03:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
to amend the title of the bill and
 
03:54:53.429 --> 03:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
replace it
 
03:54:54.630 --> 03:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
do you want to hear
 
03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
should i should i continue and
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:04.399 --> 03:55:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:55:05.990 --> 03:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:08.150 --> 03:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your amendment
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
yes this amendment uh simply uh changes
 
03:55:15.750 --> 03:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
the original proposal from creating a
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
committee to creating a commission
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
so there would be a mix of
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
legislators and individuals from the
 
03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
public to investigate costs
 
03:55:27.750 --> 03:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire taxpayers associated
 
03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
with deportation of individuals
 
03:55:33.750 --> 03:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire and just very briefly
 
03:55:36.150 --> 03:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
as we talked about
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
earlier when non-citizens who have
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
children who are american citizens are
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
held in detention or deported the costs
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire citizens is unknown
 
03:55:49.830 --> 03:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
a commission would be charged with
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
collecting data and informing us about
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
of those
 
03:55:57.670 --> 03:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
actions so we heard from case studies
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
about these costs but putting together a
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
group that would focus on collating this
 
03:56:02.319 --> 03:56:03.510 align:start position:0%
group that would focus on collating this
information

03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else before i speak
 
03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative shares
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um so i'm looking at the uh
 
03:56:17.110 --> 03:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
the legislative members so
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
section four i believe that's where it
 
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
lays out what the exact um you know what
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
the commission will be studying it's
 
03:56:26.790 --> 03:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
still it says the commission shall
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
the effects of deportion of deportation
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
of primary earners on family members who
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
are united states citizens so
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
that correction that was from the last
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
um from the last the original underlying
 
03:56:42.469 --> 03:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
bill still wasn't changed and it's still
 
03:56:46.150 --> 03:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
um not addressing what the prime sponsor
 
03:56:48.070 --> 03:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
wants the study or the commission to
 
03:56:50.150 --> 03:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
address which is it's i keep hearing you
 
03:56:51.510 --> 03:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
know what's the effects on the cost to
 
03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it's looking specifically at
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
the effects to the families so i'm very
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
much confused now this amendment was
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
brought forward to kind of remedy those
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
concerns but not even the simple
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
grammatical change to make it
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
grammatically correct was made so um i
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um you know addressing a
 
03:57:10.389 --> 03:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
number of the concerns that the majority
 
03:57:12.070 --> 03:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee brought up but even
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
still it seems like only half of them
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
were considered and the uh the exact um
 
03:57:20.550 --> 03:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know the exact uh scope
 
03:57:22.710 --> 03:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
of this commission is so broad uh you
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
know i would want to know the fiscal
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
note too right how much how much
 
03:57:27.670 --> 03:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
resource is this commission gonna need
 
03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:28.389 align:start position:0%
resource is this commission gonna need
to

03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
study the deport you know such a complex
 
03:57:32.550 --> 03:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i'm going to have to
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
oppose the amendment and the underlying
 
03:57:38.309 --> 03:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know i did talk to the prime sponsor
 
03:57:41.590 --> 03:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday and today and i told her that
 
03:57:43.590 --> 03:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
we'd give this more than a fair chance
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that i expect to be
 
03:57:46.870 --> 03:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
coming late that would give it more than
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
a fair chance and a you know an
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity i'm a pretty open-minded guy
 
03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
but still you know the concerns
 
03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
addressed uh brought up by the majority
 
03:57:56.469 --> 03:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
still are not
 
03:57:59.429 --> 03:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
fully addressed
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
if i may just speak to you can for a
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
moment um go ahead no and i appreciate
 
03:58:06.150 --> 03:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciated your questions uh
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
originally at the hearing i thought they
 
03:58:07.760 --> 03:58:08.469 align:start position:0%
originally at the hearing i thought they
were

03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:58:10.630 --> 03:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
they were good ones um
 
03:58:12.630 --> 03:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of i know you had
 
03:58:14.309 --> 03:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
concerns for example about data
 
03:58:16.389 --> 03:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
collection like
 
03:58:18.790 --> 03:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know are you initiating a large
 
03:58:21.750 --> 03:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
research study here
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
what we know is that many organizations
 
03:58:28.309 --> 03:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
non-governmental organizations
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the state collect a lot of
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
information about this so this group by
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
studying the effects
 
03:58:37.590 --> 03:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
would be able to go to those
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
organizations collect that kind of data
 
03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
now by effects there is a
 
03:58:46.950 --> 03:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
series of effects right so for example a
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
case study was introduced where with the
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
ayala family where
 
03:58:51.359 --> 03:58:52.389 align:start position:0%
ayala family where
um

03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
the the kids uh lose their dad for a
 
03:58:56.550 --> 03:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
year to an
 
03:58:58.469 --> 03:58:58.479 align:start position:0%
to deportation
 
03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
procedures and they incur
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
mental health problems school-related
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
problems which relate which lead to ieps
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
individual education plans which in turn
 
03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
lead to special education costs that the
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the state of new hampshire
 
03:59:18.389 --> 03:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
must incur so when you say
 
03:59:18.399 --> 03:59:20.309 align:start position:0%
must incur so when you say
facts

03:59:20.309 --> 03:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
facts
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
you have to not just say money
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately we want to know what the
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
costs are but you have to look at
 
03:59:28.630 --> 03:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
what what effects does this have on
 
03:59:31.910 --> 03:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
individuals which then leads to
 
03:59:31.920 --> 03:59:33.110 align:start position:0%
individuals which then leads to
costs

03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
real costs to the taxpayer
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
good good yeah no i certainly i
 
03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that but typically
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
commissions have a number of you know
 
03:59:46.150 --> 03:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
for example the um
 
03:59:47.590 --> 03:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh the uh what's it called the
 
03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
commission that we established in house
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
bill um 1441 right there was there was
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
about eight points that the commission
 
03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
would address um effects is just a very
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's very broad like i said i i
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
think that you know this really you know
 
04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
04:00:04.269 --> 04:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
one thing is i don't even think we'd be
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
statutorily uh establishing that they
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
can collect that information from from
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
private organizations too right we've
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
just said the effect so it seems like
 
04:00:13.510 --> 04:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
we'd have to use any state information
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we have which we know we lack
 
04:00:16.870 --> 04:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
thereof to
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
for the commission to look at and then
 
04:00:20.150 --> 04:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't even say that they'll compile
 
04:00:21.429 --> 04:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
it i don't even
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
i haven't had a moment to read but it
 
04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't even say it'll compile it into a
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
report commission shall okay any
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations for proposed legislative
 
04:00:31.030 --> 04:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay so they'll
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
put forward recommendations but i don't
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
even see that it says oh shall report
 
04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
okay so that would be a report my
 
04:00:39.189 --> 04:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
apologies on that but even still um
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know the prime sponsor said at
 
04:00:43.510 --> 04:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
length multiple times um this is to
 
04:00:45.269 --> 04:00:45.279 align:start position:0%
study the costs the cost the cost of the
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
public and this doesn't in any way in
 
04:00:49.349 --> 04:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
any demonstrable way say that that's
 
04:00:51.269 --> 04:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
what this commission will be studying it
 
04:00:52.950 --> 04:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
just says the effects and i'm you know
 
04:00:54.389 --> 04:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
the way i read it says the commission
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
shall you know
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
the word study should be there shall
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
study the effects of deportation of
 
04:01:02.309 --> 04:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
primary earners on families who are
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
united states citizens it seems like
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
we're just studying the effect on the
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
family we're not studying any of the
 
04:01:09.510 --> 04:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
public costs and with that i mean you
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
know it seems like the intent even of
 
04:01:12.550 --> 04:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the underlying bill is
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
not in conjunction with what the prime
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor intended and um you know i know
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
she's tried a few years at this and i
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
would hope that after hearing the
 
04:01:22.150 --> 04:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations and seeing the majority
 
04:01:25.269 --> 04:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
reports um and the kinds of things that
 
04:01:27.429 --> 04:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
she would make the proper remedies to um
 
04:01:29.189 --> 04:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
to address that and you know i know
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
she'll probably run for re-election
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
again and she's in a pretty safe
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
district and she'll probably get
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
re-elected again so she'll have ample
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to take another stab
 
04:01:39.189 --> 04:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
at this next time
 
04:01:39.199 --> 04:01:40.630 align:start position:0%
at this next time
okay

04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:42.389 --> 04:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
represent mars miller
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
um just in response to representative
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
deshay when we were talking about house
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
bill 1411 and about removing the part
 
04:01:53.670 --> 04:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
that had to do with reporting on federal
 
04:01:55.750 --> 04:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
refugee locations somebody from your
 
04:01:57.910 --> 04:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
side did mention the fact that the
 
04:01:59.590 --> 04:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
reason why it should be included is
 
04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
because it will give us data as far as
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
schools and monies and things like that
 
04:02:05.279 --> 04:02:05.990 align:start position:0%
schools and monies and things like that
so

04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:06.000 --> 04:02:07.269 align:start position:0%
so
this

04:02:07.269 --> 04:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would help to supplement
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
that piece
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chairman
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh i mean i think uh whoever said on
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
this side i don't think it was myself
 
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
but i think they were mistaken because
 
04:02:21.510 --> 04:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
the only data we'd collect would be the
 
04:02:24.150 --> 04:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
number of refugees that we just know the
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
number i don't even know if we know
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
where they were relocated to right i'm
 
04:02:28.469 --> 04:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
not sure it's it would be at the
 
04:02:30.150 --> 04:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
discretion of the federal government to
 
04:02:33.990 --> 04:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
um to report that so i think um you know
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
to each their own i think there's
 
04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
private there's a lot of private
 
04:02:37.830 --> 04:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
information that can be compiled by
 
04:02:39.510 --> 04:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
other ngos and i think it's honorable
 
04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
stuff that they would do to compile that
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
information it just doesn't seem like
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
this commission will be able to serve
 
04:02:46.710 --> 04:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of what the prime sponsor
 
04:02:47.990 --> 04:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
wanted and i think that's the biggest
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
takeaway at least from my perspective
 
04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay my representative moffat
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
i'm actually inclined to look uh
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
favorably at this amendment
 
04:02:59.600 --> 04:03:00.870 align:start position:0%
favorably at this amendment
because

04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:03:04.150 --> 04:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
if the if the major thrust of it is to
 
04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
change from a committee to a commission
 
04:03:06.239 --> 04:03:07.030 align:start position:0%
change from a committee to a commission
i

04:03:07.030 --> 04:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
i had
 
04:03:10.229 --> 04:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
always had reservations about it being a
 
04:03:12.630 --> 04:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
strictly legislative commission a
 
04:03:12.640 --> 04:03:13.590 align:start position:0%
strictly legislative commission a
committee

04:03:13.590 --> 04:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:03:16.550 --> 04:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think a commission uh is better
 
04:03:19.510 --> 04:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i i think that in a sense this may
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
be a one vote
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately a one-vote margin either way
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
on on this
 
04:03:28.570 --> 04:03:28.580 align:start position:0%
i would rather vote for the better bill
 
04:03:28.580 --> 04:03:29.990 align:start position:0%
i would rather vote for the better bill
[Music]

04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day than for a lesser
 
04:03:32.000 --> 04:03:33.269 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day than for a lesser
bill

04:03:33.269 --> 04:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
so again if you're tracking what i'm
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say and this is from
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
experience from other committees
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
i think that this amendment improves
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:03:46.150 --> 04:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
so whether or not i would vote vote for
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
the otp in the end i i'm not saying at
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
this point but i think i'm inclined to
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
vote for anything that gives us a better
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill to ultimately consider if if you're
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
tracking me on that
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
just uh to add to this this bill's been
 
04:04:05.189 --> 04:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
here geez how many times
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
the federal government is responsible
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
for immigration
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
how school problems
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
private information you can't get it
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
social problems psychiatry doctor dr
 
04:04:21.030 --> 04:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
hippa protected how you can't get the
 
04:04:21.040 --> 04:04:22.150 align:start position:0%
hippa protected how you can't get the
information

04:04:22.150 --> 04:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
healthcare hipaa protected you're not
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
going to get that information
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh federal taxes on individuals once
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
again protected information you're not
 
04:04:32.150 --> 04:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to get it
 
04:04:34.469 --> 04:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
this commission is feel
 
04:04:34.479 --> 04:04:35.349 align:start position:0%
this commission is feel
good

04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:04:36.710 --> 04:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
to the people
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
but cannot do nothing it's a waste
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it's a waste because we
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
have no power on immigration if we want
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
to know how much money is being spent
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
all you got to do is check with uh your
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
local on how many yes i don't even know
 
04:04:53.830 --> 04:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
they give you the nominee numbers
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're illegal on the children if
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
whether they can give you that number
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay in the school systems i don't know
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
if that's even we can even get that
 
04:05:02.880 --> 04:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
if that's even we can even get that
um

04:05:03.910 --> 04:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
so yoga you want to pass something that
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
does no weight whatsoever but to people
 
04:05:12.389 --> 04:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
in the community you give them false
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
hope that's what you give them with this
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
here because there's not a damn thing
 
04:05:18.790 --> 04:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
you can do as legislators in new
 
04:05:18.800 --> 04:05:19.910 align:start position:0%
you can do as legislators in new
hampshire

04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
and believe me i tried it in my district
 
04:05:24.870 --> 04:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
a family they got kicked out the father
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
had to leave
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
but the the kids were all you know they
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
were american citizens
 
04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay but then they have to go back to
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
the proper procedure on sponsoring him
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
to bring him back
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's the law there are laws that
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
will land here but the president today
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
does not want to comply with those laws
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
they're saying we want to fix
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
immigration but they're not doing
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
nothing democrats were in charge
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
republicans were in charge nobody
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
changed immigration laws
 
04:05:54.630 --> 04:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
so the laws are there for a reason and
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
we want to subside and move aside the
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
laws and say let's try to pick something
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
we know damn well
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
we have no control over sounds good wow
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
look at us we're proud we're going to do
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
something here for the
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
people there that are the breadwinners
 
04:06:12.630 --> 04:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
that have moved out of the state but
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do can somebody
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
show me or tell me
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
what you can do for that person when
 
04:06:19.349 --> 04:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's a federal law and there's no state
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
law that covers it can somebody help me
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
out here and show me that why i should
 
04:06:26.070 --> 04:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
change my mind
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
anyone in the room here
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's the bridge
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
not good look mr branch
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think everybody in this room can agree
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
that immigration is a federal issue
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that this bill does not
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
directly tackle that but it's it's doing
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
its part in
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
let us study how much our state is
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
losing in revenue and spending uh
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
on these children of people who are
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
being deported or families of people who
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
are being deported and let us tell our
 
04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
congressional delegation that
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're spending hundreds of thousands of
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
dollars uh i i would assume if these
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
people are deported we're losing this
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
can i stop you for a second here you're
 
04:07:09.429 --> 04:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
not answering my question
 
04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
how can you find this information that
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
is illegal to get
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
that we have no power unless you have
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena power how are you going to get
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
the data
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
you answer my question please
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
tell me on this why i should support the
 
04:07:23.520 --> 04:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
tell me on this why i should support the
commission

04:07:25.990 --> 04:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
to that i guess i would say it's more
 
04:07:29.189 --> 04:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
about the raw data not the personal
 
04:07:29.199 --> 04:07:30.790 align:start position:0%
about the raw data not the personal
information

04:07:30.790 --> 04:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
there is information may i respond yeah
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
there is information that's collected by
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
these organizations across the state
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
american friends religious organizations
 
04:07:42.399 --> 04:07:43.429 align:start position:0%
american friends religious organizations
um

04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:45.510 --> 04:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh colleges and universities are doing
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
research studies in these areas
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
so the commission's job would be to
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
reach out to those groups not to launch
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
their own research studies and i think
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
when representative deshay asked those
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
questions they were good ones uh at the
 
04:07:59.279 --> 04:08:00.309 align:start position:0%
questions they were good ones uh at the
original

04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
hearing how would you do that
 
04:08:03.040 --> 04:08:04.630 align:start position:0%
hearing how would you do that
precisely

04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
precisely
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
that's how they would have to do it they
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't launch their own
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
research studies they would have to
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
collect data from these groups on the
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
ground that are collecting this data so
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we can know
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
what is the effect
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
on these actions on our taxpayers so
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
as representative lebranch said so we
 
04:08:25.279 --> 04:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
as representative lebranch said so we
can

04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
report to our congressional leaders
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
what these problems are that are
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
affecting us right here in new hampshire
 
04:08:36.469 --> 04:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
so that would be my response all right
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to continue to go on this
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
here because you have congressional
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
leaders have been there six twelve years
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
four you know four six years what have
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
they done on this
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
what have they done for the nothing
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna do and spend money on
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
travel and everything else on
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislators and get data
 
04:08:57.189 --> 04:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
that you can pick up the phone and call
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
your your state senator i mean your u.s
 
04:09:01.510 --> 04:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
senate and your congress right now and
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
say hey we got a problem uh you know we
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
got people that are being
 
04:09:07.110 --> 04:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
sent out here they know that she was the
 
04:09:07.120 --> 04:09:08.389 align:start position:0%
sent out here they know that she was the
governor

04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
governor
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
hassan was the governor
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know i mean maybe it's time to start
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
replacing people whether it be
 
04:09:15.750 --> 04:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
republican or democrats are not doing
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
04:09:19.750 --> 04:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm saying but but you
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
want to do this here commission
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
and give the people
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
false hope
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
because there's not a damn thing we can
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
do it's a federal issue it's a
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue so any of my
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
republicans support something like this
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
here you go it's a constitutional issue
 
04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
what can we what can we prove nothing um
 
04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
my question is when you say give them
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
false hope who you say who's that
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
talking to people that their
 
04:09:53.349 --> 04:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
breadwinners have been um you know uh
 
04:09:53.359 --> 04:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
breadwinners have been um you know uh
deported

04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
deported
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
in the american citizens what they call
 
04:09:59.189 --> 04:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
what there's a name for it uh when they
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
come in and they have children they come
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
in pregnant have kids here or they had
 
04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
anchor babies because you know i mean
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been settled in the courts
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
yet in the supreme court but i'm saying
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
those people are thinking new hampshire
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislators are doing the best damn
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
thing for me they're looking out for me
 
04:10:16.149 --> 04:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to fix it now because
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking up at the data when
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
really if you wake up and smell the
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
coffee it's not a damn thing we can do
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
nothing and we spent all this money
 
04:10:27.030 --> 04:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're thinking that that
 
04:10:30.149 --> 04:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
this is going to remedy their situation
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
i just think that with more data and how
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
it affects the community they live in
 
04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
because they do bring in revenue and how
 
04:10:40.389 --> 04:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's going to affect their families i
 
04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
think that's what we're looking for well
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's other areas they bring in they
 
04:10:44.950 --> 04:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
bring a lot bringing crime they're
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
bringing revenue i mean it's a
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
two-three-way street i mean you got
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
people being killed around the country
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
with duis by people that aren't licensed
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
or illegals from other countries so
 
04:10:57.110 --> 04:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff they bring in
 
04:10:59.110 --> 04:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
but most good many of them are working
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
people hard-working people
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean but you have some
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
that are you know bringing in crime but
 
04:11:05.590 --> 04:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
this does this no good because it's a
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
food so well we're going to know okay we
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
spent 300
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
or we on we spent millions of dollars in
 
04:11:16.229 --> 04:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
education we already know that we
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
already know manchester schools all you
 
04:11:19.510 --> 04:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
got to do is call the school system and
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you how much money they're
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
paying for 62 or 65 foreign teachers you
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
know for foreign languages yes sir
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting into discussing
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
the totality of the bill and as i said
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
earlier for me the immediate question is
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
does the amendment is the amendment
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
better than the original bill and as
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
i've already said i think i think a
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
commission is better than the committee
 
04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
for reasons numerous reasons so for me
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
the immediate question
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
for me is is is the amendment better
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
than the original i think it is so i'm
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
inclined to vote for the amendment and
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
then and then we could have a
 
04:11:57.110 --> 04:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
a fuller discussion on the bill and its

04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh of the house but in the committee you
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
can't move the question okay thank you
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
and i have mason's manuals here if you
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
want i trust you mr chairman i just was
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
checking okay uh anyone else
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan um
 
04:12:37.110 --> 04:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
of course a lot has gone by since that
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
but one of the arguments you made was
 
04:12:39.040 --> 04:12:39.910 align:start position:0%
but one of the arguments you made was
that

04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
we couldn't get this information without
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
subpoena power by um i believe actually
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
i know certainly
 
04:12:48.149 --> 04:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
the house has does have subpoena power
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i think we both remember when that
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
rule was passed about 10 years ago so
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
we actually the commission probably
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
would have subpoena power although it's
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
fairly cumbersome because on the house
 
04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
side you have to go through rules
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
and then wait for a session day and then
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
to get majority of the house to vote for
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
the subpoena but we do in fact have
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
subpoena this commission could have
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
subpoena power if it
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
you but been here 15 years and never
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
seen it once we tried it a few years
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
back when we when we went after a judge
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah to impeach a judge yes and we we
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it yeah we went after it on
 
04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
a redress uh on a marital master and we
 
04:13:26.070 --> 04:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it so this is why i'm
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
trying to say this is feel good
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
commission yeah and i think we're making
 
04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
a mistake on supporting it and just best
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
off it
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
and then you all have the power to call
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
your senators until you send they get
 
04:13:39.670 --> 04:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
off a butt both of them
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
and you know and it just isn't democrats
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
so don't get me wrong it's republicans
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
and democrats
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
that aren't uh have been fixing this for
 
04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
years the federal law is here for a
 
04:13:48.399 --> 04:13:49.750 align:start position:0%
years the federal law is here for a
reason

04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.680 --> 04:13:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
without any i'm going to ask uh my
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
collection says nothing else here to uh
 
04:14:03.269 --> 04:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
take a roll call vote on
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%

04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
and i have a motion
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
even though you have not
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
as as amended of course well don't make
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
a difference yet until we itl goes so
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%

okay yeah because we don't necessarily
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
have to go to an author pass and go
 
04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
right to an itl
 
04:16:19.040 --> 04:16:20.309 align:start position:0%

the minority position right what what
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
this does here this helps the uh
 
04:16:37.590 --> 04:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
minority they can take that amendment
 
04:16:40.229 --> 04:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
and put it in the count and then on a uh
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%

by me and then second by brody is there
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
anyone in here that wants to speak on
 
04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
this itl
 
04:17:22.159 --> 04:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
this itl
uh

04:17:25.750 --> 04:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
i will agree with what i believe a
 
04:17:29.670 --> 04:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
member on the other side will say that
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
this bill needs a lot of work even just
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
as written uh it needs a lot of work
 
04:17:37.510 --> 04:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
just grammatically and procedurally
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
and for that i would support the itl
 
04:17:40.080 --> 04:17:41.269 align:start position:0%
and for that i would support the itl
motion

04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
04:17:45.510 --> 04:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
famous your uh point of order i'm trying
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
to understand so i
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
we just
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
approved the amendment yes
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
and now we're and now we've got a motion
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
there for not to pass on the bill
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
so so this is not we're not
 
04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
voting on otp as amended we're voting on
 
04:18:00.800 --> 04:18:02.309 align:start position:0%
voting on otp as amended we're voting on
itl

04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay so my my comment on that is uh as i
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
try to explain a couple of times i i
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
think the amendment makes the bill
 
04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
better and i always want to vote on
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
whatever moves forward if it moves
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
forward i want the best bill to move
 
04:18:14.720 --> 04:18:15.590 align:start position:0%
forward i want the best bill to move
forward

04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that a better bill is a
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
commission as opposed to a committee
 
04:18:22.229 --> 04:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
which is why i supported the amendment
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
that said
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh if if we're now looking at a itl
 
04:18:27.199 --> 04:18:28.149 align:start position:0%
uh if if we're now looking at a itl
motion

04:18:28.149 --> 04:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
on the bill itself
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
i would support that because i don't
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
think that the as has been said from
 
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
both sides there's there's work that
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be done on this so
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at an itl motion it
 
04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like we are i would support itl
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
of of the of the measure
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
one thing one thing you'll learn uh with
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
experience on being up here there and
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure representative hogan knows you
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
never take a bad bill and try to make it
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
a better bill you end up making worse
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
and you don't uh dodge your eyes and
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
crush your t's
 
04:18:59.590 --> 04:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know i mean like i said it's one of
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
those things that sound good but
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
this here
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
is there's a lot of work here especially
 
04:19:06.950 --> 04:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
with the federal you need to get federal
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
law changed
 
04:19:09.750 --> 04:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know i mean before you can move
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
forward because otherwise you're voting
 
04:19:13.189 --> 04:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
there going against the constitution we
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
all take the oath and the constitution
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
the support and defend
 
04:19:19.110 --> 04:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's why that um
 
04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
your um
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
amendment sounds good but it still goes
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
against the constitution
 
04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
04:19:29.110 --> 04:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank the uh the the
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
minority uh minority of the committee
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
for uh putting this forward and trying
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
to address our concerns it's a um it's
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
an honorable olive branch but still i
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
think the the core for me is still the
 
04:19:39.359 --> 04:19:40.309 align:start position:0%
think the the core for me is still the
scope

04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
scope
 
04:19:42.630 --> 04:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
of this study and i keep hearing
 
04:19:44.070 --> 04:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we're going to see how it
 
04:19:46.630 --> 04:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
affects taxpayers this commission as
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
established in statutory law would not
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
be studying that it would be studying
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
the effects of deportation of primary
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
earners on family members who are in the
 
04:19:58.229 --> 04:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
united states there's nothing this
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
commission you know and it's a study
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
that we're voting to itl but let's say
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
theoretically somehow you guys find some
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
votes to make it so then you get to the
 
04:20:07.590 --> 04:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended motion on the
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
floor and if this went into law
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
the the scope of the commission is still
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the effects of the family members who
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
are united states citizens
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not on the taxpayer
 
04:20:22.229 --> 04:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
ramifications and i'm not sure if i'm
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know i've never been a part of a
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
commission but i'm not sure if a
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
commission can deviate away from its
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
originally statutorily uh its statutory
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities right so with that i
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
mean what the what the minority party
 
04:20:36.389 --> 04:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
wants this now you know
 
04:20:37.990 --> 04:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
the commission to do
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
i this bill doesn't have the commission
 
04:20:42.309 --> 04:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
do that and you know that's why i'm
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against the bill
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
um i voted for the amendment because i
 
04:20:47.990 --> 04:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
thought i appreciated the attempt at
 
04:20:49.750 --> 04:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
trying to improve something and
 
04:20:53.590 --> 04:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
addressing my concerns but still um
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know that section four needs to be
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
completely overhauled right it's just
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
too too vague
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
scope's too large and what is being
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
addressed is not what the bill sponsor a
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
number of folks in the minority have
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned what they actually want to
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
have addressed thank you
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative hogan um yes the term
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
primary earners however
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
those people who
 
04:21:21.269 --> 04:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
are being deported were by definition
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because they were
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
even if
 
04:21:25.680 --> 04:21:26.630 align:start position:0%
even if
um

04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
well even though we don't have a famous
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
donor state income tax there's still the
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
federal income tax which they would have
 
04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
to pay and then we do if they're working
 
04:21:34.399 --> 04:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
to pay and then we do if they're working
for

04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
a private business there's also the
 
04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax which
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
effectively is an income tax paid just
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
paid for by the employer rather than by
 
04:21:44.550 --> 04:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
the employee and of course they're
 
04:21:44.560 --> 04:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
the employee and of course they're
paying

04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
paying
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
taxes on electricity and other prepared
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
foods and other things like the
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
primary earners are by definition
 
04:21:54.070 --> 04:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so at least it's a very bad
 
04:21:56.070 --> 04:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
effect if you deport somebody
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
on people who are taxable some taxpayers
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
are being very severely uh affected by
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
this if you deport them and
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i'm a former
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
human resource manager when i get out of
 
04:22:10.229 --> 04:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
the marine corps can you tell me when
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
they fill out the w-2 w-4 or the 1090 uh
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
these different forms that you fill out
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to remember it's been a while
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
where does it show that you're illegal
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
and where does it show on your data and
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
how much money
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
you're gonna uh how would they be able
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
to get that information on this
 
04:22:25.760 --> 04:22:27.429 align:start position:0%
to get that information on this
commission

04:22:27.429 --> 04:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
well that i um
 
04:22:32.229 --> 04:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
well you can't get it from the w-2s w-4s
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
or 1099s because that doesn't check off
 
04:22:36.070 --> 04:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
even whether the person is taxes that
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
was sent in i'm saying where does it say
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
that they're uh green card or they're
 
04:22:40.560 --> 04:22:41.590 align:start position:0%
that they're uh green card or they're
illegal

04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:22:42.720 --> 04:22:44.229 align:start position:0%
um i
haven't

04:22:44.229 --> 04:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll get that information i mean i
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
want you to break it down and think
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
about what i'm trying to bring i mean
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
they do
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
i mean there is data out there on like
 
04:22:50.880 --> 04:22:52.070 align:start position:0%
i mean there is data out there on like
uh

04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:52.080 --> 04:22:52.870 align:start position:0%
uh
what

04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
what the uh
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
what the so-called primary earners are
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
doing and i'm sure in the private sector
 
04:22:58.950 --> 04:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't exist that's something the
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
commission will find out i mean
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
certainly i
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going to be under
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
federal tax form so
 
04:23:04.479 --> 04:23:05.429 align:start position:0%
federal tax form so
thanks

04:23:05.429 --> 04:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
mr mr chairman may i respond
 
04:23:11.830 --> 04:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh yeah good yeah um i just i still you
 
04:23:11.840 --> 04:23:13.189 align:start position:0%
uh yeah good yeah um i just i still you
know

04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
we got to look at the grammar of the
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
language of the bill right and it says a
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
committee shall and you know forgets
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
word study but shall study the effects
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
because that's what's implied she'll
 
04:23:23.349 --> 04:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
study the effects of deportation of
 
04:23:25.510 --> 04:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
primary earners on
 
04:23:27.110 --> 04:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
family members who are united states
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
citizens we're not studying the primary
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
earners we're not studying the people
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
who are deported
 
04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
quite literally they're out of the
 
04:23:35.990 --> 04:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
country because they were deported not
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
in america anymore i don't even know how
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
we could find them
 
04:23:41.110 --> 04:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
we're studying on
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
family members who are united states
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
citizens that's what the study is about
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's it that's the only thing that
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
we're studying and what we're studying
 
04:23:50.710 --> 04:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
in regards to them is how they were
 
04:23:53.110 --> 04:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
affected by the deportation of primary
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
earners we're talking about taxpayers
 
04:23:57.429 --> 04:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers costs costs communities
 
04:23:57.439 --> 04:23:58.550 align:start position:0%
taxpayers costs costs communities
communities

04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
we're only going this the only the only
 
04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
thing this study committee and you know
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
theoretical commission could study
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
according to the statutory law that we'd
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
establish you know that the general
 
04:24:08.950 --> 04:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
court and if it was even signed by the
 
04:24:10.950 --> 04:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
governor would be how does the
 
04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
deportation of that primary earner which
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
isn't defined in the bill either what is
 
04:24:15.910 --> 04:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
a primary earner could it be multiple
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
primary owners one primary primary
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
earner um
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
how does that affect the family members
 
04:24:23.110 --> 04:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot of legitimate
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
questions as to how do you collect that
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
information on the family members how do
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
you do that and the commission in no way
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
kind of establishes how it's going to
 
04:24:32.950 --> 04:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
compile those things too because it
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't really
 
04:24:36.630 --> 04:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
establish what exactly it's going to be
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
doing in section 4 of the amendment so
 
04:24:40.870 --> 04:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
with that you know it's kind of what
 
04:24:41.830 --> 04:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about whether it's
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional it's kind of a move point
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't do what it's intended
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
to do and a lot of people are kind of
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
misconstruing what its intent is
 
04:24:49.840 --> 04:24:51.269 align:start position:0%
misconstruing what its intent is
okay

04:24:51.269 --> 04:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
