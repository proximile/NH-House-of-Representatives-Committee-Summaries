00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
sorry just a little bit from me to the
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee but but uh all my favorite
 
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 align:start position:0%
friends can listen in on this um today
 
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
we start with what I call the beauty
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
pageant and that's where we have members
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
from the Departments that uh frequently
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
come before us come before us in a more
 
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
convivial way to introduce themselves uh
 
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.029 align:start position:0%
convivial way to introduce themselves uh
I

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
will share their nicknames that I have
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
for them and things like that we are
 
00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
going to start this afternoon in the
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
hearings and we're going to start sharp
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
at 1 so please be here 12:55 and the
 
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
reason is because the person who is the
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of the 1:00 Bill also has
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
another bill to present a few minutes
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
later this is the price of
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
popularity I will when I find them
 
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
introduce our committee assistant and
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
researcher just a few words about how we
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
Pro seed in hearings for those of you
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
who are new if you wish to speak to a
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
witness please put your hand up if I
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
don't see your hand uh somebody else can
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
kind of point but uh we worked at
 
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
yes I bought one of those extended hands
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
that you know you scratch yourself
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
within the shower because I could never
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
see representative Raymond down the end
 
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
so I finally concluded you can always
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
move her you know so here she is but if
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
you put your hand up wait to be
 
00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.749 align:start position:0%
you put your hand up wait to be
recognized

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
and what you say next is thank you Mr
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh chairman is my preferred uh
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
pronoun I sit on my chair but I am the
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
chairman uh other people who pinch hit
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
for me may have different ways they wish
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
to be addressed and that's fine so
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
you'll say Thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
then turn to the witness and say thank
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it is a
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
question it's not a speech there's time
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
for that later you don't set up your
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
question with a preliminary remark you
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
simply ask a question we are here to
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
elicit information there will be times
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
for us to give our opinions to each
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
other do not cross-examine the witness
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh if you come really close believe me I
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
have too and uh this isn't
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
Congress if you are a sponsor or
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of one of the bills that we
 
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
will be hearing here you have a
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
choice either you can be a witness and
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
testify or you can be a member of the
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee to ask other Witnesses
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
questions you cannot do
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
both so if you decide decide to start
 
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
asking Witnesses a question and then you
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
decide oh I'd love to go and test it's
 
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
other if you ask a question and you
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
think that that was only a partial
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
answer being given you can ask for
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
followup and usually the signal is like
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
that wait for me to say yes go ahead and
 
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
that wait for me to say yes go ahead and
follow

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
up if we are in a hearing where a lot of
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
people have signed the pink card to
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
speak I may impose a three-minute
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
rule people say that's not fair I took a
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
day off from work to get here one of the
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
best speeches I've heard from a witness
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
lasted 47 seconds it had all the
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
information it was clear it was precise
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
if it is a paragraph cut it down to a
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
sentence if it's a sentence cut it down
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
to a word or a phrase it can be done a
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
lot can be said in 3 minutes and quite
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
frankly those of us who have mild add
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
stop listening after 3 minutes anyway so
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
you're not helping yourself
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
um at three
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
minutes I will make some kind of a
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
comment you got to wrap it up which
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
means I'll give you about 15 seconds to
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
wrap it up if you're testifying and at
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
the end of that I'll cut you off I
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
control everyone's mics from right
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
here uh when we bring in members of an
 
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
agency or a department it isn't a three
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
minute rule for them they can make the
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
Witnesses exing
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
bills right after we've had a hearing it
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
is possible to vote on that bill right
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
then many of us find that helpful
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
because if we wait a month we've pretty
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
well forgotten already what we've heard
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
so right after it however I will check
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
with my ranking me and Deputy ranking
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
member um what they think and this
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
worked really well the last couple of
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
years if it looks like it's going to be
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
a close vote and one side or the other
 
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
is short a person that would make a
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
difference in what we recommend I won't
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
exect the bill at that time we'll
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
advertise when it will happen if we
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
think that we need a discussion further
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
or that somebody might bring in an
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
amendment we won't EXA the bill right
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
away we will usually only exec those
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
bills where it's pretty clear all of us
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
or most of us are on board with what
 
00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.829 align:start position:0%
or most of us are on board with what
we've

00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
got the history of this committee going
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
back a
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
ways was not good many people believed
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
that they were harmed by an extremely
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
unfair and corrupt judicial
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
system and therefore we're going to fix
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
them we're going to run for office ask
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
to be put on this committee and since
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
very few people wanted to be that was
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much assured and then we're going
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
to fight and as a result very little
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
actually got
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
done it got to the point where in
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
2016 in that day when we vote on house
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
rules Speaker of the House Shan Jasper
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
was going to shut this committee down
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
well the house overruled him but you got
 
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
to know the idea of shutting a committee
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
down has to say there have been some
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
problems my
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
attitude is that we're not here to gang
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
up against we're here to gang up against
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
problems not people not the department
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
not the Judiciary not that Bureau even
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
when we disagree we are not to be
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
disagreeable we will work together I
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
find most people respond to that and as
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
happen if you make a motion when we are

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
disposal many people have asked the
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
question will there be a two-year
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
extension on the special committee on
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
the Family Division of Circuit Court you
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
may remember chairman Lynn's Judiciary
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
Committee and my children in family law
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
committee each named five people to this
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
10p person panel and we got a lot done I
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
think again because we tried to work
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
with and not against the Judiciary we
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
tried to identify problems and it was a
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful relationship we picked a lot
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
of lwh hanging fruit could we Mr Speaker
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
go further up the tree and his answer
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
was no but no he is not going to
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
reconstitute that
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
committee but he says as chair of a
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
committee I can appoint a subcommittee
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
and I could appoint a subcommittee of
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
whatever number to look at some of these
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
issues in effect keep the thing going so
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
if this sounds something you are
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
interested in if you would like to be on
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
such a subcommittee think about it we
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
won't be doing this for 6 eight weeks at
 
00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:54.519 align:start position:0%
the earliest think about it think about
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
what issues in the judicial system
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
Family Court you think think could use
 
00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:01.829 align:start position:0%
Family Court you think think could use
some

00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%

resource I just want to begin uh with
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
the mission of the child support program
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
which is to encourage responsible
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
parenting Family self-sufficiency and
 
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
Child well-being and we do that by
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
providing services to help locate
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
parents uh who may be absent from their
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
family household assist in establishing
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
paternity or legal fatherhood for
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
children uh we help families to
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
establish and or modify support orders
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh which include child and medical
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
support orders and we also help families
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
enforce those court-ordered obligations
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
when it is necessary um so the child
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
support program really achieves uh seeks
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
to achieve positive outcomes for
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
children um by addressing the needs and
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of parents to help
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
support them you know the child's of
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
children need both parents um and
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
support in many ways and our program is
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
designed to try to assist families in
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
many different
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances but our largest
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
contribution is to help um provide
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
income for families to support their
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
economic Mobility by collecting and
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
dispersing child support payments um and
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
in doing so we
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh engage with both parents um and serve
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
both um parents in the household uh
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
through the services we provide helping
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
families receive child support really is
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
an as income reduces um child poverty
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
and promotes self-sufficiency so in
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
helping families address some of the
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
economic barriers that they may have to
 
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
compliance we are be better able to uh
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
assist the whole family um and we do
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
that by partnering with a number of
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and community services
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
Community so our Bureau of Child Support
 
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
Services as mentioned is within the

Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh we lie within the division of
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
economic stability um and we are one of
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
the large the child support program in
 
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:57.640 align:start position:0%

00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
support and anti high-poverty programs
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
for families we have here and families
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
um we provide services to families of
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
children whose parents or caretaker do

not reside in the same household
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
together um and we um collect and
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%

instate and outof state services and in
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
some circumstances we work with our
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
International Partners as well as some
 
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
tribal communities as well so either
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
parent can apply for our services um we
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
collect and distribute private not
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
government funds to families to help pay
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
for their basic needs and we are always
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh trying to engage and assist parents
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
who are willing and able or unable to
 
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
support their children and only work to
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
uh enforce the responsibil ities of
 
00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:02.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
unwilling so we um provide our service
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
delivery that we have is available
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide we provide services um
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
throughout within all of our district
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
offices we are there to help families um
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
you know nationally the child support
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
program uh collects approximately 29.6
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
billion nationally
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh for families and 97% of those uh
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
funds that we collect go directly to
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
families um so here in New Hampshire uh
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
in uh fiscal year 2023 our program
 
00:25:46.389 --> 00:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
dispersed about $76 million to the
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
families that we are
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
servicing and much of that is uh often
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
90ish perc of that goes directly to the
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
families and about 75% of the the income
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
that we collect is done uh through an
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
income withholding order here in our
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
state so we have um we work very closely
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
with our court systems we work very
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
closely with our employers here in New
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire both of which play a vital
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
role to helping a secure income for
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
families here in our state our governing
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
Authority is
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
um uh we operate under an approved state
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
plan uh for uh the title Roman numeral
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
4D or part D of the Social Security Act
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
and uh under our uh approved plan is how
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
our program uh operates the services
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
that we are required to provide as a 4D
 
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
child support program and you know
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
through the last 50 years so the Social
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
Security Act act uh for the child
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
support program was enacted in 1975 so
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
this program has been in existence for
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
50 years and in the last you know 10 to
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
15 years the child support program has
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
really moved to a family centered whole
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
family approach and that is certainly
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
something that we strive for and take
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
great pride in here in New Hampshire as
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
at the bureau as well so in your slide
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
deck we I have U put references to all
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
of our governing authorities for you
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
should you wish to um uh reflect on
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
those and act as
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
resources um of course as I mentioned
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
one of our key um areas of program
 
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
operations is to uh help engage families
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
to comply with their support orders and
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
in doing so we can offer uh we have kind
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
of a broad array of different types of
 
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
authority to be able to help families
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
comply with their orders when they are
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
unwilling and it's important to note
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
that their ability to pay must be taken
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
into consideration when we're looking at
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
um uh taking that Authority um towards
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh helping families to comply but our
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
first line of defense is always to
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
really look at what the economic
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
barriers are to fam's success to be able
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
to comply with those orders and try to
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
alleviate those barriers as much as
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
possible by connecting them with
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
Community Resources and services however
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
possible so
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
again um we have provided a little bit
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
of our um information about what those
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
um authorities are for you if you have
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
any specific questions we'd be happy to
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
try to answer them you know really we
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
contribute to the strength and economic
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
mobility of families by collecting and
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
dispersing child support that is owed to
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
them and we work with a number of
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
additional departments um excuse me
 
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
additional members of our departments to
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
help facilitate hate that what I just

Madam bureo chief on page eight the top
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
slide one of the enforcement remedies is
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
listed as passport denial we have a bill
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
coming before us this afternoon an
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
individual the way his paycheck and
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
transmitt thing broke
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
goofily he was 4 cents short but
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
therefore the only reporting was he was
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
not in compliance so his passport was
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
denied so this afternoon we want to keep
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
passport denial for the dead beats but
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
we do not want to have someone like
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
himself as he has and people like him
 
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
that he knows so that'll be coming up
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
this afternoon also to your knowledge or
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
actually anybody else's knowledge we
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
looked at the question of license
 
00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:41.519 align:start position:0%
suspension in the last legislative
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
session because it's very hard to Garner
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
somebody's wages if they can't drive to
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
their job and they live in a place where
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
there is you know we don't have a subway
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire um so I don't
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
know what did we do with that last term
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
does anybody remember representative
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
Raymond both of those
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
um there were issues with whether or not
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
we would lose I think it was like $20
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
million a year in federal funding if we
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
passed those bills okay so I'll be
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
interested to hear what the updated
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
numbers are for how much Federal funding
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
is tied to those Federal requirements
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
that child support comply with thank you
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
so much um in our hearings from the
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
general public and the special committee
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
on Family Court um we had numbers of
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
people testify that the
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
spouse was under a Judicial income
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
withholding order but the income wasn't
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
withheld and that there were people who
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
could pay but didn't pay and one person
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
says that is either fantasy or an
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
outlier but we kept hearing that and
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't to put anybody Judiciary or
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
yourselves on the spot it's just um
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
should someone come to me with that
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
complaint about the spouse that that
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
person is not observant of the court
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
to so I if if an in if a family
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
structure has a order for child support
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
and the court has ordered that that um
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
child support be paid by an in
 
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
assignment either parent can apply for
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
our services and we can assist them with
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
initiating an income withholding order
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any other questions
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
from anyone else on the
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you bureau
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
chief counselor or did you have a
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
presentation counselor I do not Mr
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much and my
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
information on there's as on there's oh
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
is your mic
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
on it is I guess it is now a little red
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
light appears yeah um so what what is
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
the threshold for
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
considering um passport refusal in aares
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
what I mean 4 cents seems ridiculous to
 
00:33:19.159 --> 00:33:22.629 align:start position:0%
what I mean 4 cents seems ridiculous to
me

00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
um what is there a threshold before you
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
go because I'm going to be straight up
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
I'm still oldow 70 ,000 in child support
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
right so I could understand you holding
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
his passport and everything else if you
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
could ever find him but 4 cents just
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
seems really ridiculous to me and how
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
happen oh thank you for the thank you
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
for the question representative um and
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
we can expand on that later on this
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon and but I think I I would say
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
that preliminarily
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
talking about passport or passport
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
program it's a federal program and they
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
set the guideline to be
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
$2,500 so if if someone is in $2500 in a
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
then they get submitted to the passport
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
denial program
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
um it will stay denied until it reaches
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
zero or if they work
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
out something with our agency so if they
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
theoretically U and I can't speak speak
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
about this person's case or do I really
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
know anything about this particular case
 
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.629 align:start position:0%
know anything about this particular case
but

00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
hypothetically um what should happen is
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
a person would get notification from
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
Department of State I believe um I can
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
verify that but they would get
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
notification that their passport was
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
denied and they would be most likely
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
prompted to reach out to their case
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
officer with a bureau and the idea is to
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
sort of work out something that's going
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
to be agreeable to the all parties and
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
so you know or if there's a hardship for
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
example um those types of factors can be
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration as well I'm I'm
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
hoping Council you can be here for that
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
hearing which is at 2 o'clock I will be
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%

about our strategic priorities and
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
looking forward in the future and I'll
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
start on slide one with our dcyf mission
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
and our mission is to really partner
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
with families and communities to provide
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
resources and supports that lead to the
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
safety and healthy development of
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
children youth and the communities in
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
which they live and I do want want to
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize the work that dcyf does on
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of children and and youth with
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
their families uh many people that um
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
think about the work of dcyf and
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes even the workforce um as we
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
interview um potential new hires think
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
about the work that we do with children
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
but the Partnerships that we have with
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
families are really important to ensure
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
that families have what they need to be
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
children there are three primary
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
functions of DCF
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
and those are Child Protective Services
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%

setting moving on to slides four and
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
five you'll see data reg regarding our
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
CH our Central intake which is the
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
hotline where people report concerns for
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
abuse and
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
neglect and you can see some data here
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
um if you look to to slide four um I'm
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
sorry Slide Five you'll you'll see a
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
better visual of the of the trend of
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
2023 you'll also see a breakdown um by
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
type of report so you'll see um at the
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
bottom of Slide Five the pink color is
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
those calls to intake that are screened
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
in screened in means calls that met
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
criteria to be investigated by our field
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
facing child protective service
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
workers the blue color are those calls
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
that are screened out so for a screened
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
out call to Central intake what that
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
means is it did not meet criteria for
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
investigation however we're still able
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
to provide an intervention for the
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
person reporting or for the family
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
through referrals that we make from
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
Central intake or through a community
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
Navigator program where we have a person
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
with lived experience be able to make
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
Outreach to the reporter or the family
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
to again provide information and
 
00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:01.950 align:start position:0%
to again provide information and
potential

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
referrals the calls designated in that
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
yellow category are noted as additional
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
information so those calls to Central
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
intake are kept um and and sent on for
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
information because we're already
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
involved with a family so the call
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
itself does not meet criteria for a new
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
investigation however because we may
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
already have an open investigation or an
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
open case the information received is
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
passed on to the ongoing child
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
protective worker as information for
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
consider on side slide six these are our
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
total new
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
investigations so once a call comes
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
through our hotline is screened as
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
meeting criteria for investigation this
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
is the count of the total new
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
assessments or investigations conducted
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
you can see there was a dip in 2020
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
around the time of covid and a bit of a
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
steady increase from then I know I don't
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
have 2024 data on this slide um however
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
preliminarily um the number does dip
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
down a bit again so the trend does not
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
2021 slide seven shows the open cases
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
once a decision is made on the
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
investigation that it's necessary for
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
dcyf to open a case and serve the family
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
in a longer term um process of providing
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
services and working with the family uh
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
we would open a
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
case so the top um information the top
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
data slide um on slide seven shows the
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
trend of open cases between 2019 and
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
2023 and the bottom half of the slide
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
shows the number of children served at
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
any point during those
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
years the pink is the total number
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
served the blue is the number of
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
children served in placement or out of
 
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.549 align:start position:0%
children served in placement or out of
Home

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
Home
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
Care the yellow is the number of
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
children served in their
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
homes and the green are the number of
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
eight in our Juvenile Justice we've been
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
under transformation since about um 2019
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
or a bit before that time um we began
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
but more significantly since 2019 and
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
we're really looking to build
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
alternatives to the Juvenile Justice
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
involvement through diversion and our CH
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
children's system of
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
care it's trying to understand youth
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
needs before they need formal system
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
involvement in the Juvenile Justice um
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
formal process where we intentionally
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
divert and deflect uh when the needs can
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
be met outside of that formal Juvenile
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
Justice System it's based on providing
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
individualized care and the rules of
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
Probation and case plans on identified
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
Youth you can see on slide nine this is
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
an example of one of the ways that we
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
would divert youth from the formal
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
Juvenile justice system and that's
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
through work with our children's system
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
of care um a program called Fast Forward
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
which is High Fidelity High F Fidelity
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
wraparound services and you can see
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
between October 16th and January of 2024
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
the significant increase in our use of
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
youth on slide 10 is a visual of our
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
open Juvenile Justice case
 
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
cases the top half of the slide is
 
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
numbers of Juvenile Justice case open
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
and you can see the decrease between
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
2019 and 2023 of numbers of Youth
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
cases the visual on the second half of
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
slide 10 is a count of Juvenile Justice
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
youth in placement and again since 2019
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
you can see the significant decrease in
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
placement slide 11 further illustrates
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
the work done by the juvenile justice
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
transformation efforts and you can see a
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
decrease over time in the number of
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
Center the greenish color is the total
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
number of Youth and then it's broken out
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
by committed and detain with committed
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
being the blue trend line and detained
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
orange slide 12 depicts deliberate work
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we're really proud of at
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
DCF we've made significant efforts and
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
will continue to for the next couple of
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
years to ensure that when youth or
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
children require out of home placement
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
that they're able to be um be residing
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
community-based caregiving setting such
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
as kinship care or foster care rather
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
than um Residential Group home treatment
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
and on the slide on page 12 you can see
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
the yellow line is a depiction of the
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
children in kinship care and kinship um
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
our relatives or people known to the
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
child such as a coach or a babysitter or
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
someone um that the child is comfortable
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
and could live with also known as
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
fictive AB absolutely thank you yes so
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
that yellow line for the first time you
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
can see um in about October of 2024
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
crossed over so we had more children in
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
kinship care than we did in foster care
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
treatment on slide
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
13 there's a a brief outline here to
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
look at our strategic priorities for
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
2025 and 2026 six and we're really
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
looking to the Future and so what's next
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
for DCF so we've spent about the past 5
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
years really Transforming Our Juvenile
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
Justice System we've brought on a lot of
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um Services uh many with
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
with your support and so we thank you
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
for that um and so where do we look to
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
now um and this slide depicts
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
this so the four areas that we intend to
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
focus on are included in that circular
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
visual it's our case practice in blue
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
our service array in Green Building our
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
new YDC in Orange and in purple we'll
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
also be building a new electronic case
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
management system to replace the system
 
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
that we have currently from
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
1997 in our practice in the upper
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
leftand uh Corner we'll reduce the
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
percent of Youth and residential
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
treatment will increase the percent of
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
Youth who lived in family settings
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
kinship relative and Foster family
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
homes next to our service array we'll
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
increase children served in their own
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
homes and increase foster home
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
availability for children specifically
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
we hope to increase availability of for
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
17 our new facility will be open by
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
December of
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
2026 we'll train all employees in a
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
trauma informed care model called
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
Target and our census will not exceed 12
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
youth at any point in
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
time our case management system Granite
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
2026 and we believe with these goals in
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
mind and this Focus that we'll be able
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
to achieve the best outcomes possible
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
for the children and youth that we serve
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
and our goal is really to build trust
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
and confidence in our agencies so that
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
families feel um open to our involvement
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
open to our engagement with them open to
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
our ability to understand their
 
00:49:31.549 --> 00:49:31.559 align:start position:0%
strengths and needs so that we can best
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
needs on the next slide on slide 14 I'm
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
just going to take a moment to dig in a
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
little bit further on two of the goals
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
practice and then the next slide will be
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
the service
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
array so under practice we're really
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
going to focus on ensuring that family
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
engagement is at the heart of
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
DCF we believe in proving engagement
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
will ensure that children can live
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
safely with their parents or in an
 
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
alternative setting if necessary as
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
often as
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
possible we plan to engage with families
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
have transparent
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
Communications um we want to focus on
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
identifying strengths and needs we also
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that caregivers so
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
relatives kinship providers foster care
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
providers feel valued feel a part of the
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
the the process and I feel like at the
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
table with us um before during and after
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
placement to re reduce use of
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment by ensuring the
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
15 we have a dedicated focus on trying
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure we have the right services for
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
the right Children and Youth and
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
families at the right time we need to
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
strengthen our community based services
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure their quality and that they
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
are available at the time they're needed
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
our goal is really to prevent any child
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
Youth and Family from coming any more
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
deeply into our formal system than is
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary to meet their needs
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
and how we're talking about doing that
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
is through engagement in these Services
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
is by ensuring at every opportunity so
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
at Central intake if we have to if we're
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
if we're able to stop the family from
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
coming into having an open investigation
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
by providing referrals at that Point by
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
re um offering a community navigator to
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
talk and work with the family around
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
their needs then we should do that and
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
and prevent them from having any further
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
involvement with DCF if we do have an
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
investigation let's try to service that
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
family with quality services through
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
that investigative process or through a
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary case if we're required to open
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
a case and serve the family longer term
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
let's make sure we can do it in the
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
family's home if we need to remove the
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
child from the home let's make sure
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
we're using Community Based Services uh
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
placement options like kinship and
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
foster care so our effort is really to
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
be as preventative in nature as possible
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
and again prevent the family from coming
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
necessary and that concludes the
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
presentation that I have for you today
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
that you have couple things for me Madam
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
director on slide 13 the new facility
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
will that be the one that's going up in
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
my front yard
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
yes that's the one in Hamstead 200 yards
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
away from my house and I really
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate how well you folks in the
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
department worked to help me um let's
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
just say intersect with the locals of
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
which I'm one but still so thank you so
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
much for that and uh it lists here 12
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
youth yet we expanded it a little bit in
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
terms of bedrooms could you speak to why
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
that was absolutely thank you for that
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
question so we need to make sure that we
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
have space to spread youth out so the
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
new YDC will have 18 beds but the goal
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
will be no more than 12 youth in those
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
18 beds and we need the additional beds
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
for things like new
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
admissions someone that might be sick if
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
someone has covid we need to be able to
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
separate into different locations within
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
the building um often times there's a
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
court order to keep certain youth
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
separated from one another they might be
 
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
mutually involved in the same case we've
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
got um gender reasons to separate youth
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
so there's a variety of reasons that we
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
may need youth to not be congregated so
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
closely together so we need the
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
additional bed space to spread there may
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
be a time in the future when a committee
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
akin to my special committee for the
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
Family Division of circuit court is
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
convened to look at
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
DCF I sincerely hope we get it right
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
this time agreed and we I will do
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
everything I can to make sure if it's
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
reconstituted it is reconstituted in a
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
collaborative attitude thank you you're
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
welcome any other questions
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond yay thank you
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question on slide number 11 um
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
you've broken down um kids who are
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
committed versus detained and I wondered
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
if you could explain a little bit about
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
what the differences are between uh
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
sure sure committed youth are those that
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
have committed an offense before age 18
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
where if they had been adult it would be
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
a felony or a
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and detained youth are they
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
are not yet adjudicated and they are
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
ordered into the care of a restricted
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
facility so not a residential treatment
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
facility or a foster home but into the
 
00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:03.150 align:start position:0%
facility or a foster home but into the
secure

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
secure
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
setting so just to thank you just to
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
clarify so the the committed um kids are
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
ones who have already gone to trial and
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
been convicted whereas detained their
 
00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:14.670 align:start position:0%
been convicted whereas detained their
awaiting

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
awaiting
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
trial yes generally speaking or awaiting
 
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
a verdict yeah okay thank you other
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
Mr and thank thank you for taking the
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
question M well team members right here
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh specific to page
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
five and asking what your guidance would
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
be relative to the screen in and screen
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
out Are there specific
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
criteria for the individuals doing these
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
evaluations for those who are then
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
determined which door they go through
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
next or uh is it interpretive or is it
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
specific on what the rules are so we
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
have spefic specific policy that guides
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
our Central intake staff so we have
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
child protective service workers that
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
take the initial calls they enter
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
information into our database they
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
review our policy and our definitions
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
they review any involvement that the
 
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
family already has with with us they
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
think about uh factors such as the age
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the child um the potential risk as a
 
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
result of any unique factors is is a
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
disa child is it a young infant um and
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
then they understand the caregivers uh
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
Behavior or what whatever the
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse neglect are and
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
they look at that in our the lens of our
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
policy to make a screening decision
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's also then reviewed by the
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
supervisor at Central intake before the
 
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.870 align:start position:0%
supervisor at Central intake before the
final

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
decision thank you m representative
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
you good get the hang of it um specific
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
seven um I'm wondering why the explosion
 
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
in the green for the in prevention
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
cases um for the last 20 22 and 2023
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that we actually view that as
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
positive so those prevention cases are
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
not they're not open court cases those
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
are um situations where families
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
voluntarily entered into an open case
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
either with DCF or with um one of our
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
two contractors who um oversee
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
community- based voluntary services for
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
and are able to provide services in an
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
effort to prevent deeper involvement in
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
the system so the increase in prevention
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
cases is a positive where we see
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
families open and interested to um the
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
services that we can provide follow
 
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um you you would
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
think that you would see the other lines
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
go down as the green bar Rises so are we
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
looking at a lot of kids that are still
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that we would so the
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
those that are in green are sometimes
 
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
the highest need families that often
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
don't get served um through DCF or its
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
Community Service uh availability so
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
while I realize we're not seeing a
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
decrease in the total um children served
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
overall um I I still would not see it as
 
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
a negative to know that we're serving
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
more children um in those prevention
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
cases okay thank you thank you and
 
00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:33.069 align:start position:0%
cases okay thank you thank you and
representative

00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
you for being here and taking my
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
question my question is related to slide
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
five and I'm wondering if you could
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
please um help me understand a little
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
bit better and I'll just give you a
 
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
scenario um that I thought about in my
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
mind um if there is a family that has
 
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
let's say three um um open cases uh
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
three different
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
allegations um and um there is an a
 
00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:04.950 align:start position:0%
allegations um and um there is an a
another

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.710 align:start position:0%
another
call

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
call
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
um the allegation would be unrelated to
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
the three that are already open would
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
that be regarded as a fourth open case
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
information so if there are three
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
allegations regarding a family and a
 
00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
fourth unrelated is called in to our
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
Central intake each allegation needs to
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
meet our criteria um as representative
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
McMahon outlined and asked of me so each
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
unique allegation needs to meet criteria
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
to result in an investigation regarding
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
that allegation so it would be taken on
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
its own Merit based on the call to
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
us but exactly I think maybe the point
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you're asking describes what the
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
additional information is so so if that
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
fourth call did not meet the criteria
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
for a new physical abuse allegation
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
let's just say that would be sent on to
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
the current child protective service
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
worker as added information so here this
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
did not meet criteria but here's some
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
information that you could talk with a
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
family about may help answer a question
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
for you might give you the name of a
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
collateral person that you could contact
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
to learn more about but again each each
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
allegation in and of itself needs to
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
meet its own criteria or else it's an
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
additional information thank you y any
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
further question from the committee
 
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.990 align:start position:0%
further question from the committee
representative

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%

rice thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question regarding um the new
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
YDC facility Could you um refresh my
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%

Fox I am the director of the division
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
for Behavioral Health with me I have
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
Daryl Tenny who is the bureau chief for
 
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of uh children's Behavioral
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
Health and he'll be speaking to the deck
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
that you're just getting right now I
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
want to open by first saying that I had
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity yesterday to spend a
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
little time prepping for this and I read
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
each of your bios um so I went online
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
and I was looking at the legislative and
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
said who's on that committee and it
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
really struck me how um
 
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
great depth and um experience that you
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
all have in this space so we're going to
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
talk about the children's system of care
 
01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:45.559 align:start position:0%
in a formal Manner and it's actually in
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
statute the system of care but just
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
realize you are part of the system of
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
care and I hope you recognize that as we
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
talk about all the service that we do
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
provide for families and children and so
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
with that I'll describe the division um
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
we are made up of the division of as I
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
said the um the Bureau of children's
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health we also have the
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
Bureau of drug and alcohol Services the
 
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Mental Health Services which
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
addresses the adult
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
population and the Bureau of homeless
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
services is and all together we work um
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
side by side to really address the needs
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
of families when it comes to behavioral
 
01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:36.150 align:start position:0%
of families when it comes to behavioral
health

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
conditions and again um going back to
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the system of care in statute it is to
 
01:03:46.109 --> 01:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
have an integrated and comprehensive
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
delivery structure for the provision of
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
publicly funded Behavioral Health
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
Services to New Hampshire Children and
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
Youth and so again we're going to be um
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
talking about a lot of things that we
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
know and they come off the tip of our
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
tongue very easily and it may not be as
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
familiar to you so please understand
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
when we talk um about these if you want
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
more description please just let us know
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll be happy to do that but the
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
bottom line is we're here to serve
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
families and children in their
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral health needs so with that I'm
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
going to turn it over to Daryl who will
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
walk you through the deck
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much good morning chair
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
good morning committee uh to many of you
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
I'm new um it's great to meet everybody
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
um hoping to see you this this group
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
much more in the future um a lot of the
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
work that we do is Broad and um
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that this overview um goes
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
into a broad lens in many different ways
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm hoping to tell a story I'm
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
hoping to share the picture um I'm
 
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
hoping to talk about the the children's
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
system of care work that's been
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
happening for for many
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
years um I you know I I do want to give
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
a a shout out to our small But Mighty
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau for children's Behavioral Health
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
I've been with our Bureau since 2016
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
I've been in a clinical role for many
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
years prior to that I know I I probably
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
look a little bit young sitting here um
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
I I assure you I've been in the clinical
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
role for uh a couple decades um so I I
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
understand the children's system I've
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work um with the
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
children's system of care as we've as
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
we've built it together um so I will
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
follow through the slides I've been
 
01:05:29.269 --> 01:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
known to go off the script here and
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
there uh you may hear that but I welcome
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
any questions and and we'll we'll move
 
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
on through um I I do want to say it's
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard for families to navigate
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
systems I I think we I want to recognize
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
that I I've being in this field for as
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
long as I have I've seen it I've I've
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
lived it um I have children of my own um
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
I understand what it's like to navigate
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
um needs of children and um having
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
families uh struggle through that is
 
01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
difficult uh We Serve All Families in
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
that way um and the children's system of
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
care framework is really meant as a way
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure that families uh are are able
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
to go through a Continuum of Care as
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
easily as possible um our our previous
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
presentation talked a lot about systems
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
and prevention of highlevel needs and as
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
you as I go through this uh presentation
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see why this is so critical to be
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
able to help prevent youth from high
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
levels of care to meet those needs and
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
so we have we have children all over our
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
communities um with behavioral health
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
challenges we need we looking to build
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
resilience is really important if you
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
turn to slide three um you're going to
 
01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lot of pre-work
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
that has been done to help support the
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
work that we've done over the last uh
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
handful of years at least um one of
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
which Kya had mentioned already RSA 135f
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
which is our system of care uh law and
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
so um I know Kya had shared uh the the
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
information around that law but it's
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
been critical um and really required us
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
to to have in Statue a Continuum of Care
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
for all children what you're going to
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
see for the next several slides are uh
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
the the tiered Services the tiered
 
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
supports that we have developed or that
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
we collaborative collaborate very
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
closely with with other parts of the
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
department other partners in our local
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
communities um but I wanted to at least
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that folks here in the community
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
had an understanding of all of the work
 
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
that has been over over a long period of
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
time and I do want to highlight uh you
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
know this this overview will also um
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
Talk quite a bit around our Partnerships
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
as we map on
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
through so I'm going to shift the slide
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
for a bit and this is really our
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
children's system of care framework as
 
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see it here very colorful uh I'm
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to go through each tier uh at a
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
high level um but really what we what I
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
want to share the most from this
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
particular slide um is is really the
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
framework overall and it is truly meant
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
to be the Continuum right so we want
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
families to be able to access the level
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
of care that is needed when they need it
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
how they need it um and and that's
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
really important so having assessment at
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
each part of uh the the tiered system is
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
is key you'll also he uh see here that
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
the Valu that are um embedded in each
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
one of our contracts and each each one
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
of these tiers is really critical in in
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
what we do um at a bureau level at a
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
department level and and so I'll list
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
them here but um you know they're
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
they're all very critical we have trauma
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
informed family and youth driven um
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
Community Based ensuring youth are being
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
served and supported in our communities
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
and and culturally and linguistically
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
competent and again we we we ensure that
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
this these values are are embedded in
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
all of the contracts um that we oversee
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
at at the Children's
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
Bureau so I'm going to I'm going to
 
01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
shift to slide five um and this is
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
really going to dive into our tiered one
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
services and and so we consider tier one
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
um early identification screening and
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
and access to resources we we rely quite
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
a bit on partnership in this particular
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
tier and I'm not going to I won't read
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
all of the services that are bulleted
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
out here for timing purposes um but it's
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
really critical for the committee to
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
understand um how far reaching those
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
Partnerships are um we we work very
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
closely with public health um there's
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
quite several initiatives coming out of
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
Public Health to support population
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
Health um maternal Childhood Health
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
early interventions um certainly other
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
parts of the division um and and
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
Department that we we collectively work
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
with um we do have a direct contract
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
with a peer-to-peer youth um grief
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
supports and and that has been critical
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
in in terms of prevention for youth that
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
has experienced a grief a grief or a
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
loss um um so that preventative tier one
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
Services is is really critical for what
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
we've built in we also work very closely
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
with Managed Care organizations um there
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
are three Managed Care organizations and
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
we meet with them frequently to ensure
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about certain members
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
that may be stuck um may may need help
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
navigating the system in any particular
 
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
particular way um and I and I do want to
 
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
um recognize that RSA 135f really
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
statutorily has us working very closely
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire education
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
department and so we're We join New
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education um to ensure that
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're providing a Continuum across
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
across this
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
tier I I did also highlight the
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
collaboration with Early Childhood
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
Services longterm supports and services
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
early supports and services that's also
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
very critical for our tier one uh
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
interventions so I'm going to skip to
 
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
slide six um T which we really consider
 
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
tier two Community Based Services which
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
are available to all um many of us know
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we've had core really uh our
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers have
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
been core to much of the work that we've
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
done for for many years in New Hampshire
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
um we have 10 Community Mental Health
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
Centers of course that provide a broad
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
array of supports um we do oversee co-
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
oversee with the Bureau of Mental Health
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
Services a contract for for all of those
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
Centers and and they Pro and we continue
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
to provide that quality oversight um
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
they're they're uh really just a core
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
service to that tier supports multiple
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
families access uh the Community Mental
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
Health Center system we also partner
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
very closely with Fe federally qualified
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
Health Centers um and while we don't
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
have any direct contracts with federally
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers there are over
 
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
65 federally qualified health centers in
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I won't name them
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
all of course but um we do have several
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
that um that attend our community or our
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health our
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
children's system of care advisory
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
committee um pretty regularly so to
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's connection
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
there I I did want to highlight here we
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
our partnership especially in tier 2
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
around youth that are involved in
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
special education so our connection with
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
school districts are critical here um
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
youth with 504 plans our connection with
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
parent information Center um as well as
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Developmental services are
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
2 so I'm going to shift to slide seven
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
um tier three so uh we really consider
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
this for when youth um and or a child or
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
youth or their families need some more
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
intensive community- Based Services this
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
tier is really meant to to to uh capture
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
and support those more intensive needs
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh within the community and you'll I
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
know in the previous um presentation
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
from DCF they had referenced a fast
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
forward program um we also highlight
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
that here we we do have two Care
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
Management entities that provide um
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
three different types of services fast
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
forward being one of them um we also
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
have an early childhood wraparound
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
program which is very similar to the
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
fastforward program just a a younger
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
Target population as well as a an
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
enhanced care coordination service that
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
is meant to support youth transitioning
 
01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
is meant to support youth transitioning
in

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
either it's meant to support youth that
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
are either transitioning into a
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
residential setting or out of a
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
residential setting in in efforts to set
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
them up to to be successful in the
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
community we also partner very closely
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
with organizations uh that provide
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
partial hospitalization programs um
 
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
several join the children's uh system of
 
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
care advisory committee as well um and
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
in uh through our fast forward program
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
we also work very closely with several
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
um certified uh individualized service
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
option providers um many of which are
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
similar to um providers that DCF use um
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
but several other intensive inhome
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
providers that can be available to
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
families through this highlevel
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
service so I'm going to I'm going to
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
turn to slide
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
eight I I did want to briefly highlight
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
um I I am recognizing I could probably
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
take 30 minutes for each one of these
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
tiers so this high level tough for me um
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
I I slide eight is really um
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
representing for when youth is are being
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
contemplated for residential treatment
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
and this is um this has been a a
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
critical shift in our thinking around
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
how do we support youth that do need
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
that high level of care and and again
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
the the goal of the system of care is to
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
prevent high levels of care like
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
episodes of residential treatment we
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
want Youth and families to be successful
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the community um but when all that's
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
fills a youth and the family have has
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
tried everything we we also want to make
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
sure that their their needs are matching
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
the right type of care what slide 8
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
represents is a is really a New
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire single standardized assessment
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
which is really uh meant to identify the
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
needs of Youth that are being
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
contemplated for that episode of
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment you'll see in the
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
diagram below and and I I'll talk a
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
little bit about the child adolescent
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
needs and strengths on the right um but
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
on the leth hand side you'll see a
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
diagram here um which is a key reform or
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
transformation that New Hampshire has
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
gone through as it pertains to uh youth
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
being contemplated for residential
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
treatment you'll you'll see here on the
 
01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
bottom left that there has been an
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
additional added uh Community Access um
 
01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary access for youth that require
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
an episode of residential treatment and
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
that that's something that had had not
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
been available prior uh to a lot of our
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
system of care work T typically when a
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
youth requires a high level of care like
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
episode of Residential Treatment they
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
were being funneled to DCF and or being
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
placed educationally for the for that
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
need so this additional ability to
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
access uh Residential Treatment uh
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
allows families to access that more
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
quickly and then in turn um really
 
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
return to the community as quickly as
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
possible one I could probably spend 30
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
minutes on on the child adolescent needs
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
and strengths tool um and I know know I
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
don't have time for that but I did want
 
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
to recognize that this is a standardized
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
tool that's utilized as part of the
 
01:16:32.669 --> 01:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
comprehensive assessment for treatment
 
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
process um this is a tool that's
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
embedded in uh essentially all of the
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
tiers of the children's uh system of
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
care framework and and we could really I
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
could talk and and answer any questions
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
around the use of the cans and how
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's integrated uh in further
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
slides so we'll s shift to slide nine um
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
this is really talking a bit around when
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
youth are accessing episodes of
 
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment um you can see
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
here that this uh we we really are
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
considering Residential Treatment as
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
part of the system when a youth does
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
need a residential episode um it is
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
important that um they're matched to the
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
right level of care and so this is
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
referencing that those levels of care
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
programs that we support um within our
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau um I've talked a little bit about
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
that un Universal assessment process
 
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
that process helps to determine the
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
right level of care or makes a makes a
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation to an appropriate level
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
of care and and then I talked a little
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
bit about the the new created Pathways
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
for voluntary episodes of treatment in
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
tier slide slide 10 really recognizes
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
tier five which we consider the acute
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
care and crisis response tier um these
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
are typically for youth that are
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
experiencing some level of crisis in in
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
need a quick response um this this
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
includes um our oversight of um the
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
access point um a mobile crisis response
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
and um many of you may know we do have a
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide mobile crisis response in New
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire U for both adult and childrens
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
and so we work very closely and partner
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
very closely with the Bureau of mental
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
health services around that crisis um
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis work and that that's been
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
critical for the system of Care Success
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
over the last H few years or so
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
we do work we we do work very closely
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
with emergency Departments of course
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
when youth um are are staying there
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
being evaluated in an emergency
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
department perhaps for an acute
 
01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.950 align:start position:0%
department perhaps for an acute
psychiatric

01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
psychiatric
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
hospitalization um we do we do hear
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
about those cases pretty frequently
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
there are um certainly um built-in uh
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
meetings to talk about the you know
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
quote unquote youth that are stuck um
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
and and so we work with our emergency
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
departments very closely to ensure that
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
we can get the youth to the right level
 
01:18:59.790 --> 01:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
of care and and we we also have the New
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association joining
 
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
our advisory committee as
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
well and I do want to recognize um this
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
is really where our partnership with um
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
our one designated receiving facility at
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
Hamed Hospital sits and we we do partner
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
very closely with Hamed for youth um
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
that are receiving acute psychiatric
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
hospitalization wall at Hamad um whether
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
they're stepping down back to the
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
Community we want to ensure that they um
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're being referred to the right
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
types of services that best meets their
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
needs or if they're being contemplated
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
for that high level of care that they're
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
that we're already talking about that
 
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
transition plan thereafter so that
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
close slide 11 is is really exciting um
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
essentially exciting for me so I'll hold
 
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
that as bias but um it's it's our
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health Resource
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
Center website and um good news is
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
everything that I'm sharing here is
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
really it lives in this website and it's
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
really meant to be a resource for
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
families for providers um on this
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
website you will find um search tool
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
different uh really a breakdown of the
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
levels of care um helping families
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
navigate where their needs may fit
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
potentially within that within the
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
system of care structure um there is a
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
living maintained uh living breathing
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
maintained the Search tool that is
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
available to All Families so that the
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
families can search based on the needs
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
of the child um and so um this went live
 
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
back in January it's I can't believe
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's already been a year but it went
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
live back in January of
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
2024 um and so we've been we've been
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
really um supporting um that through
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
contract um it is a.gov website and um
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's consistently maintained um from a
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
resource standpoint um I will I will
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
mention there's you know there's kind of
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
a graph traffic on the right hand side
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
there there's two Pathways one for
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
families of course one for providers um
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
this also allows um or really U
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
organizes uh key trainings for providers
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
um particularly around uh evidence-based
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
practices for for um you know for their
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
staff or for other folks that they may
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
be part of their agencies so this is
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is really exciting for us to be
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
able to help get Youth and families and
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
providers to the to the right type of
 
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.830 align:start position:0%
providers to the to the right type of
care

01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
so I think hopefully I've done a nice
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
job kind of outlining um what we've done
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
to date um it's been a it's been a huge
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
lift um there continues to be um a lot
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
of work to be done and so when I think
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
we um reflect that pretty consistently
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
what you see in slide 12 is is um really
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
referencing how how do we continue to
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
grow um how do we continue to grow the
 
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
system of care to ensure that families
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
are um able to walk through the a
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
Continuum um without getting stuck
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
without um without waiting until crisis
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and to preventively support their
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
needs 12 really is uh or slide 12 is
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
really um identifying that we are
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
working to uh towards a system of care
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
assessment process we do have a uh a
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
contract with a vendor that is really
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
diving in uh into depth into making best
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations around next steps Where
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
Do We Go From Here uh critical areas
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
critical Focus are areas um where we can
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
continue to better um uh continue to
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
build and grow what we've been doing
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
across the children's system of care
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
work so on slide 13 that really breaks
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
down that system of care assessment
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
process um you can see here on the le-
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
hand side in purple um a few of the
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
focus areas of this assessment overall
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
um I do want to identify U to the rest
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee that um this is part of
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
the road map the commissioner's road map
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
and it's built in so we're consistently
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
um updating and and talking about the
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
the the system of care assessment and
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
and and how that's going we from a
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
timeline perspective we are um working
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
towards the last legs of that contract
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so we do anticipate working towards
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
a final report having some some key
 
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations and key themes being uh
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
coming out of that assessment um in the
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.669 align:start position:0%
 
2025

01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
2025
 
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
so I will say the the last slide on 14
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
is is uh sort of loaded with contact
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
information and I know um um you know
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
John Williams uh shared some liaison uh
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
contact info this is specific for our
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau so you can see here I do have my
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
bureau chief contact at the top um I did
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
want to outline and and really um you
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
know give kudos to our a small But
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
Mighty Bureau for children's Behavioral
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
Health Team um they do a lot of work and
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
and they support quite a bit of these uh
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
children's system of care initiatives
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
that I've
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
outlined um in within the presentation
 
01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
so will you take questions as we wrap it
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
up absolutely does anyone have a
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
question for bureau chief Tenny or
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
division director
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
Fox representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that overview
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of this is new to me and
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure other people too um last
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
session one of the things that kept
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
coming up was the number of children
 
01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for um inpatient care who were
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
like stuck in emergency rooms has there
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
been any movement over the last say year
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
or so on that and do you have any plans
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
through this that would help with that
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
problem yeah great question
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um yes I from
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
from my vantage point we've seen we've
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
seen uh Improvement on that number and
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
and why while I I'll sit there saying
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's improved our mission right we don't
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
want youth sitting in the emergency room
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
we do want youth to the right level of
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
care um this is something that's
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
consistently viewed and um we we do have
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
consistent meetings um where we ensure
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
that youth are navigating through the
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
system in the way that they need to um
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
so when there is a youth stuck in in the
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
emergency room awaiting an acute
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospitalization we are
 
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
working very closely with their clinical
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
supports with their um with with other
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
agencies that may be involved with the
 
01:25:27.109 --> 01:25:27.119 align:start position:0%
family to ensure that they're they're
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
moving um in some level I have seen
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
Improvement um I can I sit here and say
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's perfect probably not um but I
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
comparatively speaking to several years
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
ago there has been some vast Improvement
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
um and um I do anticipate that we'll
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
we'll have some recommendations from the
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
system of care assessment that I
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
outlined at the very end um in some of
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
those recommendations we'll talk pretty
 
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
pretty closely around that thank you
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.149 align:start position:0%
question thank you do we have any

uh judicial branch I apologize this may
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
seem uh a little high level but I I
 
01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:39.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that everybody uh
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
had at least the 30,000 foot level view
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh of the judicial branch and of the and
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
then we'll get into the weeds of the
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court u in
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
particular so um I'll start with the
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
overview of the branch and then shift
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
specifically to the Circuit Court uh
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
today's presentation is intended just as
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
an overview and I'll be happy to work
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
with you on specific legislation uh as
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
you go through the
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
session so I want to start by just
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
mentioning our mission uh the mission of
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch our goal is to
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
provide accessible prompt and efficient
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
forums for the fair and independent
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
administration of justice with respect
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
um going to page three I want to just
 
01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
talk briefly about the structure of the
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
judicial branch so I like to think of
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
our our structure as a bit of a we're
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a triangle uh New Hampshire has
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
two trial courts we have the circuit
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
court and the Superior Court which are
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom edges and um points of the
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
triangle and at the top is the Supreme
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
Court so we have two trial courts and
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
one appell at court uh in New Hampshire
 
01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
and then as you see we also have the um
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
Administrative Office of the courts and
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
that area is the part of the judicial
 
01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
branch that provides uh all of the
 
01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
services to all of the courts such as
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
human resources accounting security
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
Communications um all of those things
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
that are the same in every Court um and
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
I have two uh members of the AOC here
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
today uh with me that I want to make
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
sure we introduce our general counsel
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
for the branch Aaron krian who many of
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
you are probably familiar with um and
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
also our uh Communications manager of
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
Harris who put together uh the handout
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh today and is uh absolutely
 
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
indispensable for to us um each one of
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
the courts uh has a uh head judge a
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
chief judge um chief justice McDonald uh
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
you may be familiar with who sits uh as
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
the head of the Supreme Court uh judge
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
Howard who is the chief of the superior
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
court and then myself uh as the
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the Circuit
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
Court um I was appointed to this
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
position uh by the Supreme Court uh in
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 2024 so this is a new I'm in
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
my first year uh in this
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
position so going uh and I want before
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
we go to the next one I want to just
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
point out in terms of the two trial
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
courts in our state uh the circuit and
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
Superior uh we have different
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions so the uh Circuit Court is
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
primarily a court of Statute so all of
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
the laws and statutes that you pass um
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
typically are often uh most applied in
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court the superior court is
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
a court of equity um and we'll get into
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
that in in a little bit but I want to
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
switch to uh page four of the handout um
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
I want to specifically mention our
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
safety and security officers um these
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
are the men and women uh who protect us
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis uh one of the um things
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we won't surprise you is that
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
there's an increased uh threat
 
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
environment uh throughout the country of
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
Judges who have been targeted um so both
 
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
inside cour houses and out um and so
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security is a is a very
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
important important part of uh of the
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
branch uh security is provided in a
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
partnership uh with the uh County
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department who provides
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
security primarily in most of the um
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
County buildings and a lot of those
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
County buildings hold both Superior and
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
circuit courts and then there's a number
 
01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
um all right and I just want to mention
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh as an aside the Gentleman on the
 
01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
right uh in the picture uh on the Safety
 
01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
and Security slide is a gentleman who
 
01:32:02.669 --> 01:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
just retired this past year after 20s
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
something years uh in the branch uh with
 
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
us and that was a second career for him
 
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
so um all right so going to slide five
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I want to start drilling down a
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
little bit into the Circuit Court uh we
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
are the largest Court in the
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
state um we have three divisions
 
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh and this was created in 2011 by the
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislature uh where they combined the
 
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
family uh probate and district courts
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
all into one Court uh and made those
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
three divisions uh under one
 
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:45.400 align:start position:0%
Court uh I often will when I'm talking
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
to people will refer to the Circuit
 
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
Court as the People's Court uh in New
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is where people the
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
average person goes uh for things that
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
happen in the normal parts of their life
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
um could be a divorce could be um a will
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
U from somebody who's died in a family u
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
a minor criminal issue uh but this is
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
where literally 80 to 85% of all people
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who access the court
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
system will access the Circuit
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
Court um and I want to just mentioned
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
that a significant majority of the
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
people who appear in front of us are
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
self-represented um so that's a big
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
Focus uh for
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
us going to to uh slide six um this
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
shows you all of the Circuit Court
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
locations around the state we have 34 of
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
them the idea is that we are a
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
community-based uh court so uh
 
01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
the circuit court is split up into 10
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
circuits uh which not surprisingly uh
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
follow the 10 counties that we have uh
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh within each C so
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see under those 34 locations uh
 
01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
10 probate divisions so there's one
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
probate division in each of the counties
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
and then 31 District and family uh
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
divisions so those are spread out uh in
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
more places so if you want to do
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
something in the probate division you've
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
got to go to the mo in most situations
 
01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
to the county
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
courthouse um otherwise there are
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
Community cour houses based all around
 
01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.910 align:start position:0%
Community cour houses based all around
the

01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
state going to slide number seven uh I
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
just want to talk about the makeup of of
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court uh right now we have
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
um the highest number of Judges we've
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
ever had uh we have 49 full-time judges
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
three part-time or pum judges
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
um four judges who are in senior active
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
status uh which means in essence they're
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
part-time they're retired but they
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
continue to sit as an active judge
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
part-time and then 16 judicial
 
01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
referees um all of these uh folks
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
are Judges who have retired and passed
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
the age of 70 and as many of you I'm
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
sure are aware you can't be called you
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
can't be a judge after the age of 70
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
based on our New Hampshire con
 
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
institution so therefore um we will
 
01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
often um appoint a retired judge who has
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
turned 70 as a Judicial referee so that
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
we can still um take advantage of their
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh wisdom and services uh the only
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
difference is at that point you have to
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
have an active judge uh co-sign their
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
orders uh we have approximately 400
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
employees uh in the branch Branch uh the
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
vast majority of those employees are uh
 
01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
state all uh Circuit Court judges um sit
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the district at least the district
 
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
and Family Division about a third of the
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
judges also sit in the probate division
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
as well um the idea here is that we're
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
kind of like in if you
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
General Practitioners if they were
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
doctors so we do a little of everything
 
01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
um when I was sitting full-time before I
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh took this position uh I was sitting
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
in Hampton and Brentwood and was sitting
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
in all three uh divisions of the Circuit
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
Court going to um slide eight to give
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
you a sense of the overall circuit court
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
filings uh the three divisions District
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
um as of last as of last year we uh well
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
so I'll start with in criminal cases we
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
handle all misdemeanors and violations
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh so Circuit Court judges can sentence
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh people up to a year uh in prison
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's a felony it will it goes
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
to Superior
 
01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
to Superior
Court

01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
however um as of last year felony now
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
come uh initially to Circuit Court for
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
arraignment bail hearings and probable
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
cause hearings uh and if a circuit court
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
judge finds probable cause then those
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
cases get bound over to Superior
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
Court um District also includes all
 
01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
kinds of Motor Vehicle cases Fish and
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
Game cases uh but also small claims and
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
civil cases landlord tenant and civil
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
stocking cases uh all are in the
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
district division I'm going to skip
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
family on here for a moment and just go
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
to probate uh trusts and Estates uh is a
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
big part of of probate but also
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
guardianships um of incapacitated adults
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
and involuntary commitments that's a
 
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
huge part of our probate uh Division and
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
also my very favorite part of the
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
probate division is adoptions um that's
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
the happy place for all judges uh it's
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
one of the few very happy things we get
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
to do um and also name changes um we
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
handle uh typical year of filing is over
 
01:38:39.629 --> 01:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
100,000 cases um I think the 124,000 is
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
from 2023 um I'm not positive but it's
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
typically over 100,000 cases a year are
 
01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
filed in the circuit court and just to
 
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
give you some frame of reference by
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
contrast about 177,000 cases a year are
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
Court so moving on to um slide nine this
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
digs a little deeper into the Family
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
Division uh cases so we estimate about
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
22,000 cases are either filed or
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
reopened uh in the Family Division uh
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
annually these matters will include
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
unsurprisingly divorce and parenting
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
petitions for those of you who aren't
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with that um parenting
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
petitions are filed in cases where the U
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
parents aren't married so that's the
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
difference between a divorce and a
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
parenting petition um child support
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
cases minor
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
guardianships um abuse and neglect
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
surrenders and adoptions reg related to
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect um all other adoptions
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
are in the probate division um juvenile
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
delinquent or surren termination and
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
surrender of parental rights uh juvenile
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
delinquency children in need of services
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
so all of those areas are uh a lot of
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
what you've just heard from DCF and and
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support so forth a
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
lot of that appears in front of us in
 
01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
court um and then all um and then
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
another large area in our family
 
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
petitions so on uh going on to slide 10
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
I want to just briefly uh talk talk
 
01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
about the divorce process divorce and
 
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
parenting petition process because
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the biggest areas of uh
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
the Family
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
Division um
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
so this slide sort of depicts what
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
everybody has to do at the very
 
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of a divorce or parenting
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
petition uh case so uh every person who
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
files one of these original petitions
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
meets with a case manager each one of
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
our cour houses has a case manager um
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
and that person is trained to help in
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
particular self-represented parties uh
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
to provide Legal Information in the
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting process um they
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
can assist with completing paperwork um
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
and they can also help parties fill out
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
paperwork uh ahead of time for a hearing
 
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
to help them prepare and know what to
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
expect um there's a very fine line here
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
uh between giving legal advice and Legal
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
Information uh we can't give legal
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
advice to to self-represented litigants
 
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
but our case managers can help them with
 
01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:37.159 align:start position:0%
process and uh Legal
 
01:41:37.159 --> 01:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
process and uh Legal
Information

01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
Information
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh the so this is a first step for
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
everyone if you parent if parents if
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
there are excuse me if a divorce or in a
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
parenting case uh there's children
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
involved uh all of the the uh litigants
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
are required to take the child IMPACT
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
Program uh to hopefully help them
 
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of a divorce or of
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
children and then going on to uh slide
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
11 so this digs a little further into
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
the weeds here uh this is the process
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
for a divorce or parenting petition in
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
the circuit court so uh the very first
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
thing is a first appearance and that
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
first appearance is actually not in
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
front of a judge that's typically with a
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
case manager um to
 
01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
help help the litigants understand uh
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
what the process is going to look like
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
and what kinds of things they need to
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
fill out Etc and then from there on
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
there's different things that can happen
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
the majority of cases are all sent to
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
mediation before or there's a temporary
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
hearing um the idea here is the the more
 
01:43:00.189 --> 01:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
we can resolve cases before they go
 
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
through the whole uh process the better
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
off it is for everyone
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
involved um and you can sort of follow
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
through here there's obviously lots of
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
process before you get to uh a final
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
trial in this and I want to going on to
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
to uh slide 12 I want to specifically
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
talk about mediation and arbitration a
 
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
little bit so within the Circuit Court
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
we have uh we oversee the office of
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
mediation and arbitration that office
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
actually serves all three courts but 90%
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
of the work that they do uh serves the
 
01:43:39.679 --> 01:43:40.830 align:start position:0%
of the work that they do uh serves the
Circuit

01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
Circuit
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
Court um and and I'm I'm not going to
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
talk about all the things they do but I
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
am going to just specifically reference
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
the uh things that the ADR office does
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
for the Family Division um so they
 
01:43:58.350 --> 01:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
handle organizing mediators for all uh
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
mediations um which is required for most
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh families with minor children it's not
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
required but it's recommended for uh
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
those without children but most judges
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
will order mediation um right out of the
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
box um reopened divorce cases so a case
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
and when I say reopened case what I'm
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
mean is for instance a divorce case
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
that's been fully adjudicated it's all
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
final there's a parenting plan in place
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
um and somebody wants to uh change child
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
support or change the parenting plan or
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh believes somebody isn't doing
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
something correctly under the divorce uh
 
01:44:48.669 --> 01:44:48.679 align:start position:0%
terms that is they bring the case
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
forward and that's that's a reopened
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
case uh so again often most of the time
 
01:44:57.310 --> 01:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
in reopened cases we send them to
 
01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
in reopened cases we send them to
mediation

01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
first um we also in the Family Division
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
have a complex family docket um some of
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
you may be familiar with judge uh lamir
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
who may have testified in front of you
 
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
before she runs the uh complex family
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
docket and these are tend to be complex
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
cases that are and multi-day trial
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
multi-year uh cases that involve either
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
complex uh legal matters or major
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
Financial uh
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
matters uh we also offer neutral case
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh that's right now being
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
done um almost exclusively I Believe by
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
some retired judges uh that has it is
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
often done sort of closer to when people
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
are getting ready to go to trial uh so
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
all the discovery is done theyve been
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
probably lots of motion practice that
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and uh at that point uh
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
they have a retired judge give the
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
litigants an idea of how they think a
 
01:46:01.629 --> 01:46:01.639 align:start position:0%
judge will if they went to trial where
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
they would come down on this case um
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
that has neutral case evaluation has
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
been incredibly successful um I don't
 
01:46:10.109 --> 01:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
have the numbers in front of me today
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that uh it's been
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
very successful with settling cases um
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.679 --> 01:46:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
trial

01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
trial
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh guardianship of uh a minor there's
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
mediation available and there's also um
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary mediated agreements uh in the
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
area uh we do well over uh 2,000
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
Division switching to uh slide 13 I just
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
want to briefly mention uh one of our
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
initiatives it's the family treatment
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
courts uh we started a pilot program in
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
Newport uh in suan County last year this
 
01:46:58.750 --> 01:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
is now it's not considered a pilot
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
program anymore it's expanded now it's a
 
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
regular program and we've expanded it
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
this year to um the Manchester Circuit
 
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
Court well not in full yet but uh a
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
piece of it and that will grow hopefully
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
over time as we have more resources uh
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
what the family treatment courts uh
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
purpose is is to
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
identify um parents who have been
 
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
um petitioned for abuse and neglect and
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's a substance abuse
 
01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.990 align:start position:0%
there's a substance abuse
problem

01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
and the idea
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
being the goal is to reunify the family
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that and we have
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
found and this is there's great evidence
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh of this throughout the country that
 
01:47:45.589 --> 01:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
these types of courts are more
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
successful in reunification in the long
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
term and what they do is it's it's a
 
01:47:50.639 --> 01:47:51.669 align:start position:0%
term and what they do is it's it's a
very

01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
intensive um
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
um way to wrap around all services for
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh a family both for treatment but also
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
finding housing finding Child Care um
 
01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
and there's regular check-ins with the
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
court system in which all of the
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
providers come in um and at the same
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
time and it's I've had the opportunity
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
to go out and and and watch this in
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
practice in Newport and it's uh it's
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
quite amazing uh and it's been very
 
01:48:28.109 --> 01:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
successful and uh the idea obviously is
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
both reunification but also uh
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
to uh lower recidivism rates and and to
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
help the actually change the whole
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
structure of this family's life um it is
 
01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
not always successful and quite frankly
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
it is heartbreaking when it's not um but
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
it when it is uh more successful than
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
successful so going on to um and I was
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
going to encourage you that there's a
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
little doesn't guess really show it here
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
but uh if you go on our website um
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
there's a wonderful video uh that
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
features judge swier uh who's been kind
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
of the leader in the Family Court
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
treatment program in our state um that
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
tells you more about the program and and
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
gives you um a a wonderful overview of
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
it so I encourage you if you have the
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go on the Court's website
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh and and look at that
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
video uh going on to to slide
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
14 I want to just
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
briefly mention a couple of our um I'm
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
not going to go through each one but
 
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
just briefly mention a couple of the
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
accomplishments of the circuit court and
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
the Family Division in particular in
 
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
2024 um we've spent a lot of the end of
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
the year um working on implementing new
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that uh the legislature has
 
01:49:58.350 --> 01:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
passed this past year um it involves a
 
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
lot of training for judges a lot of
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
training for staff members and also
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
changing forms there a tremendous amount
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
of changing forms uh when the when the
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
Law changes
 
01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
or so uh We've ALS we've put up on our
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
website uh this past year some child
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
support and parenting plan videos uh
 
01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
videos seem to be the way that a lot of
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
people um are gaining information lately
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
so uh we're trying to be responsive to
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
that and so instead of just having
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
written things on the Court's website to
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
follow uh we're trying more and more to
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh put up videos for people to watch and
 
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
listen to about how to how to uh access
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
the court and what's expected of them um
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
along the same lines we've uh on our
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
first appearance video that's where
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
you've filed a parenting plan or a
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
divorce uh We've switched that from a uh
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
URL code which is kind of a live link to
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
a QR code um again finding that uh
 
01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
people can access that
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
easier uh We've increased uh mediator
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
pay uh this has been one of of a
 
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
consistent problem I think for probably
 
01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
lots of both uh you know folks in the
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch the judicial branch uh
 
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state finding uh
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
employees and and people to do work uh
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
in certain areas we struggle to uh have
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
enough lawyers in the state to uh
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
represent families in in cases that have
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh appointments by the court
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
such as uh termination of parental
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
rights or abuse and neglect cases where
 
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
we have to uh appoint an attorney for
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
Mom and an attorney for Dad and now with
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
legislation also an attorney for the
 
01:51:59.069 --> 01:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
child in certain
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances um so one of the keys to
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
this is specifically for mediators we
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
raise the mediator pay from $60 to $90
 
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
an hour uh to get mediators willing to
 
01:52:13.709 --> 01:52:13.719 align:start position:0%
do the work um as well as of as of
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
January 1 this year we've also increased
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
the pay for Guardian ad
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
items um
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
we are doing a significant amount of new
 
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer and new judge training in the
 
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.030 align:start position:0%
lawyer and new judge training in the
family

01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
area so uh folks from from the Circuit
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
Court provide training to the new lawyer
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
orientation programs uh in the for the
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
Family Division and then uh for new
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
judges we provide approximately uh two
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
weeks of initial training in the uh
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
Family Division areas as well as um on
 
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
top that shadowing of other judges and
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
continuing uh education uh for judges
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
we've had 13 new judges appointed uh in
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
2024 and five appointed in 2023 so we
 
01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
have a huge stable of newer uh judges
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
and uh we are trying to provide a lot of
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
support uh and training to those
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
judges um I want to specifically mention
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
our text reminder uh program we've we've
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
uh started that as a pilot for Family
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
Mediation cases um it has been
 
01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
incredibly successful it's very similar
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
to when you get a uh text from your
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
doctor or dentist reminding you to you
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
know you have an appointment the next
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
day um we are now piloting that uh in
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court uh we started with a
 
01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:47.560 align:start position:0%
the Family Mediation program and found
 
01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:49.719 align:start position:0%
that it decreased the failure to appear
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
rates by 40% which was huge
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
um we are now piloting that in the
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
Criminal Division uh or the district
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
division specifically the criminal cases
 
01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh in Dover and Rochester right now uh
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
with we don't have numbers yet because
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
it just started in October but um
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
anecdotally is doing very very well so
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
we might be expanding that throughout uh
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
the the system if we
 
01:54:17.239 --> 01:54:19.790 align:start position:0%
the the system if we
can

01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
um we are starting a um Guardian ad
 
01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
light and pilot program for families of
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
lower income where there's a fund for
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
that now uh there are four locations
 
01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
that have been uh identified and that
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
will launch uh shortly
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
and we are also uh starting this year uh
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
we've been putting it into place in 2024
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
and it'll be uh launching this year a
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
pre-filing uh mediation uh project plan
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh four cases in the Family Division
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
where you can actually get um so if you
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
intend to file for divorce but you and
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
it is perhaps amicable in a perfect
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
world uh that you can actually get
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
mediation pre-filing so that you can
 
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
work something out and potentially file
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
um and agreed upon uh divorce and
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
parenting agreements so all a judge has
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
to do is review it uh make sure it meets
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
all of the legal standards and then
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
consign it so that that's happening this
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
year as well so I am uh very happy to
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
answer uh any questions for you with the
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
caveat that obviously I can't answer any
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
questions regarding any specific cases
 
01:55:37.599 --> 01:55:38.870 align:start position:0%
questions regarding any specific cases
thank

01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you um representative rice
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
mediation who pays for that
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
um it depends so in uh a divorce case uh
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
the litigants typically pay for that and
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
and except for this pilot program that
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
we're about to launch where if you are
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
under a certain income level you may
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for mediation to be paid for for
 
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
you um there are different things
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
throughout uh the branch where there are
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
some Grant there's grant funding in
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
specific areas
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
that have mediation that's paid for in
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
don't followup so you said that there's
 
01:56:33.149 --> 01:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
going to be a new program to help
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
because that was my concern was the
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
families that can't afford to pay for
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
mediation um do they still get mediation
 
01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so um that is a a new pilot program
 
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
and there is uh it's starting I I want
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
to say in four locations and then uh the
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
hope is to expand it beyond that perfect
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Greg thank you Madame
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and thank you for being here
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
and explaining all that and taking my
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
question today so in a lot of States
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
they have separate family courts because
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
the family Dynamics are so complicated
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
and stuff and and without that here I'm
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
specifically interested because one of
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
our most complicated parts of the family
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
courts is domestic violence what kind of
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
training uh do the judges have and is it
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing on domestic violence and those
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
complications yes representative uh it
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
is ongo so we let step back as a new
 
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
judge you get at least three days
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated in our judge training
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to domestic violence
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
um that's where we
 
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
start uh does not end there um within
 
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
the first two years of being a judge um
 
01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:53.310 align:start position:0%
the first two years of being a judge um
typically

01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
depending on how many new judges we have
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
um we either uh a judge will either go
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
to the judicial College in Reno Nevada
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
for a week uh where it is it's
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
specifically for family but heavily um
 
01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:11.719 align:start position:0%
on the domestic violence side of things
 
01:58:13.629 --> 01:58:13.639 align:start position:0%
um so we get more training out there
 
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
within the first two years um
 
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
occasionally and this year is probably
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
going to be one of those years uh since
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
we had 13 new judges
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh that came on the bench uh in 2024 we
 
01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
will likely bring the trainers to New
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as opposed to sending the
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
judges uh to Nevada um because it's just
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
more cost efficient uh to do that and
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
train all of and they'll have a two to
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
three day intensive training uh at at
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
that probably later this year um in
 
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
addition um we have ongoing training uh
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
periodically throughout throughout the
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
entire Branch but also specifically uh
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
in the in the Circuit Court um I will
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
share with you that I am the uh chair of
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
the internal standing uh domestic
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
violence committee within the judicial
 
01:59:07.709 --> 01:59:07.719 align:start position:0%
branch uh so it is something that I am
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
very much on top of uh and that we uh in
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
addition to formal training on it for
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
judges we also have what we call the
 
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
list serve uh where it it's in essence
 
01:59:25.149 --> 01:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
sort of an ma uh bank for judges that
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
when we have questions not maybe being
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
not being sure what to do or not wanting
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
to recreate the wheel or has another
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
judge encountered these types of facts
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
things like that that we can share
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
information uh with each other and that
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
is used uh quite a bit and uh DV cases
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
are something that that comes up uh on
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
that frequently um and uh in addition to
 
01:59:53.069 --> 01:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
that uh we meet on our regular basis
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the um domestic violence coalition
 
01:59:59.069 --> 01:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
to get people's concerns um and are
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
constantly working on trying to make
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
that area better so we can serve the
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire are in the
 
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
love thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
your honor for coming in giving us all
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
this information today uh my pleasure
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to commend the the
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
court system for the family treatment
 
02:00:22.589 --> 02:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
courts um much of the family's problems
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
are generational you I don't have to
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
tell you that uh alcoholism and drug
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
addiction uh is running rampant and and
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
ruining the lives of kids and uh you
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
know if if you save one in 10 uh you
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
know it's a major a major gain and uh
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
the question I do have is
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
um would it be your office that uh that
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
people could register complaints with
 
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
about uh uh judicial and court officer
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
Behavior so sort of
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
I would say we do have um we have an
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
email and so yes to start with we do
 
02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
have an email um and people write
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
letters and and use the email system um
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
if they have a complaint uh it's
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
a blanking on off the top of my have but
 
02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
at. yeah so it's a court con Court
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
concerns at and uh Aon will give
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
everybody the uh the
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
full eail if if you'd like to have it um
 
02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
so that is one place that you can do
 
02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.069 align:start position:0%
so that is one place that you can do
that

02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:36.510 --> 02:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
conduct the the letter that the con that
 
02:01:41.470 --> 02:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
your constituent might get back on
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
something like that um is likely to go
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
to the judicial conduct committee with
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
it um so it is so
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
if there are specific things like um you
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
know that that perhaps somebody was rude
 
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
at the counter of staff that definitely
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
should come to my office
 
02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
um we get a little of everything um we
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
we read and look at every complaint that
 
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
comes in um some of the things
 
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
are frankly people who might be
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
disgruntled because they lost their case
 
02:02:21.599 --> 02:02:22.629 align:start position:0%
disgruntled because they lost their case
or

02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
they feel like they lost their case and
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
so they're not happy about it um and a
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
lot of you know there are times people
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't feel like they were treated fairly
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh because of that
 
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh so there's also the appeal process so
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
if people aren't happy with the outcome
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
of their case that's really not a a
 
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
complaint to my office that's an appeal
 
02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court um so that's why I
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
said sort of to begin with yep
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
repes representative
 
02:02:59.790 --> 02:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
georgees thank you Madame chair um I'm
 
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
very excited when I saw the when talk
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
about the case management and uh I would
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
like you to know about the case
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
management is it new in system or if
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's nothing new when that start yeah
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's not new um I think it has
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
evolved over time um and I don't know
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
exactly when frankly you know this my
 
02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
first year in in this position so I
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly when it went into
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
place but um but it's not new uh and I'd
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
say several years ago there was at least
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
a a movement to make sure there was a
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
case manager in each courthouse uh to
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
work with it's kind of one of those
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
things I think it's um not as well known
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
and perhaps
 
02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
underutilized by uh litigants who come
 
02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
to court so I think maybe that's a a job
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
for us to do is to make sure that that
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh is easier or more well
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
known thank you very much but I think so
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's really it's better to for the
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
people to know because I know um a lot
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
of people in the community suffer about
 
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%

it is now 1:00 and the chair opens the

hearing on House Bill 170 and calls upon
 
03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Moffett to
 
03:03:24.630 --> 03:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair starting right on
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
time very impressive uh chairman Co Mr
 
03:03:32.190 --> 03:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I sit on the chair yes
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
Kudos and plotts for that appreciate it
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh for the record uh I'm representive
 
03:03:40.670 --> 03:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
Mike Moffett of maram County District 4
 
03:03:43.870 --> 03:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
which includes the beautiful towns of
 
03:03:46.830 --> 03:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
Canterbury and Lowden and I am HB 170s
 
03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor
 
03:03:51.790 --> 03:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
so I get involved with this uh when
 
03:03:54.389 --> 03:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative the representative from
 
03:03:57.269 --> 03:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
Northampton contacted me last year after
 
03:03:59.190 --> 03:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
he'd been approached by some folks uh
 
03:04:01.070 --> 03:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
from his district uh from whom you'll
 
03:04:04.269 --> 03:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
hear later concerning possible needed
 
03:04:07.710 --> 03:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
legislative actions with regard to
 
03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:09.070 align:start position:0%
legislative actions with regard to
military

03:04:09.070 --> 03:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
military
 
03:04:11.870 --> 03:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
pay uh I again for the record I'm a
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
retired uh US Marine uh Reserve officer
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I and I also chair the house
 
03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:18.950 align:start position:0%
and I and I also chair the house
veterans

03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
03:04:23.349 --> 03:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
committee so an issue here is disposable
 
03:04:27.269 --> 03:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
military retirement pay uh as opposed to
 
03:04:29.150 --> 03:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
pensions and the distinction between
 
03:04:31.830 --> 03:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
retirement pay and pensions is important
 
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:40.830 --> 03:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
later these folks hold that retired pay
 
03:04:43.469 --> 03:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
should not be considered a tangible
 
03:04:45.990 --> 03:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
asset or as property in the legal sense
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to divorce settlements I
 
03:04:50.590 --> 03:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
think they have a point and that maybe
 
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
is the perhaps the most Salient
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
important aspect to which you're going
 
03:04:58.110 --> 03:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
to be looking at here with this bill is
 
03:05:03.870 --> 03:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
the notion that retirement pay is not
 
03:05:07.550 --> 03:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
property uh you'll note the measure
 
03:05:10.910 --> 03:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
includes a a very small change to RSA
 
03:05:14.429 --> 03:05:14.439 align:start position:0%
458 colon 16a in that it crosses out one
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
line that refers to military retirement
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
and veterans disability benefits and it
 
03:05:21.830 --> 03:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
replaces it with a single sentence
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
stating quote property shall not include
 
03:05:29.309 --> 03:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
disposable retired pay as defined by us
 
03:05:34.190 --> 03:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
code 10 section 1408 unquote
 
03:05:37.870 --> 03:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
so should military retirement pay be
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
considered property in divorce
 
03:05:42.429 --> 03:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
proceedings involving veteran assets
 
03:05:43.950 --> 03:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
that again as I just said that's the nub
 
03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
of it now should this move forward the
 
03:05:49.710 --> 03:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
new statute language would give New
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire officials and judges more
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
discretion to structure fairer more just
 
03:05:59.910 --> 03:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
civil settlements for military people in
 
03:06:02.590 --> 03:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
divorce situations in accordance with
 
03:06:07.590 --> 03:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
Federal code in with New Hampshire law
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is a little bit like the
 
03:06:11.150 --> 03:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
veterans court measure I sponsored last
 
03:06:14.269 --> 03:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
year which is now and what that did
 
03:06:17.150 --> 03:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
Judge or the uh representative from
 
03:06:20.830 --> 03:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
window judge Lenn uh was a was a uh
 
03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of that measure and the
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
veterans court measure um gave judges
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
more freedom and sentencing discretion
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
so they would have more options to do uh
 
03:06:36.590 --> 03:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
types of separate uh sentencing from
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
veterans short of
 
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
incarceration so that is a sort of a
 
03:06:43.750 --> 03:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
precedent for what the intent is here is
 
03:06:47.110 --> 03:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
to give our courts to give our judges uh
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
more statutory grounds for discretion
 
03:06:54.110 --> 03:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
and flexibility and choice when it comes
 
03:06:58.349 --> 03:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
to making decisions in civil divorce
 
03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
cases and again not everyone understands
 
03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
that military retirees remain at their
 
03:07:04.590 --> 03:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
nation's call okay just because
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
someone's retired from the military
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're they're done
 
03:07:11.630 --> 03:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
in fact uh there are nor actually
 
03:07:14.110 --> 03:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
numerous cases of retirees getting
 
03:07:17.229 --> 03:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
retirement pay uh being called back to
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
work back to active duty in fact I
 
03:07:23.349 --> 03:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
myself helped to activate two retirees
 
03:07:25.950 --> 03:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
and return them to Temporary active duty
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
when I commanded a military school in
 
03:07:31.630 --> 03:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
San Diego so that is relevant as well
 
03:07:33.750 --> 03:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay retirement pay we do not see that
 
03:07:37.710 --> 03:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
as a is a as a product
 
03:07:41.469 --> 03:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
okay we see retirement pay is something
 
03:07:45.070 --> 03:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
that is not fully understood or handled
 
03:07:48.269 --> 03:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
in the best way so anyway the uh the
 
03:07:49.870 --> 03:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
following speakers will drill down and
 
03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
get into details with regard to HB 170
 
03:07:54.269 --> 03:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
it and its implications I'm sure they
 
03:07:57.070 --> 03:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
will welcome questions uh normally I
 
03:07:59.190 --> 03:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
would invite questions but I I need to
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
cross the hall um over to education
 
03:08:04.389 --> 03:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
committee where the the scheduling gods
 
03:08:08.429 --> 03:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
have me introducing another 1 pm Bill uh
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
you should already have some pink cards
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
from from some star Witnesses so uh I
 
03:08:15.790 --> 03:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
think this is a very the more I find out
 
03:08:19.070 --> 03:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
about this area of law uh the more
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
interesting it is and the more I'm
 
03:08:22.870 --> 03:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
convinced that uh some attention needs
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
to be paid to the situation and some
 
03:08:25.120 --> 03:08:26.190 align:start position:0%
to be paid to the situation and some
awareness

03:08:26.190 --> 03:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
03:08:28.870 --> 03:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
raised so if the chair will grant me a
 
03:08:31.950 --> 03:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
temporary leave of absence I will egress
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
from this area of operations for for
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
another will you be able to come back
 
03:08:40.269 --> 03:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
after you've introduced your bill across
 
03:08:42.990 --> 03:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
the hall and I asked that because uh in
 
03:08:44.950 --> 03:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
conversation with a few members there
 
03:08:48.269 --> 03:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
are some uh pretty particular questions
 
03:08:50.710 --> 03:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
or do you have somebody designated who
 
03:08:52.990 --> 03:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
can answer those questions for you thank
 
03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
you for that uh Mr chairman um I I am
 
03:08:58.429 --> 03:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
going to be immersed across the hall for
 
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
probably 45 minutes and I know there's
 
03:09:02.150 --> 03:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
certain timelines I'll come back if I
 
03:09:04.630 --> 03:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
can but I the co-sponsor will follow me
 
03:09:07.150 --> 03:09:07.160 align:start position:0%

come back if I can and if I can't uh I'm
 
03:09:13.469 --> 03:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
very confident that the folks following

03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%

I would like to see the uh co-sponsor by

03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
is in the house I have a visual on I
 
03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:29.160 align:start position:0%

03:09:31.389 --> 03:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
m uh that
 
03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%

my name is Jim
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
maor and I represent the beautiful
 
03:10:07.150 --> 03:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
Seaside community of Northampton and
 
03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
very proud to be a co-sponsor of this
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
bill I'll speak briefly because the
 
03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
gentlemen behind me are subject experts
 
03:10:16.269 --> 03:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
and can certainly answer your questions
 
03:10:18.030 --> 03:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh when Mr cin brought this bill to me
 
03:10:20.349 --> 03:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
several years ago uh he raised a
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
question to me well the bill the subject
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
matter raised a question which I
 
03:10:27.070 --> 03:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
reiterated to him just a little while
 
03:10:30.790 --> 03:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
ago in the cafeteria and that is this
 
03:10:34.630 --> 03:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
the magic that happens with I guess the
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
IRS or the courts where money turns from
 
03:10:43.710 --> 03:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
property into into property and seems to
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
morph back with no real concrete
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
evidence of how that happens or how it
 
03:10:53.389 --> 03:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
is established and that is the Crux of
 
03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
this bill to to set into
 
03:11:00.309 --> 03:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
stone where Equity where to set into
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
stone the policy by which Equity can be
 
03:11:07.309 --> 03:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
reached in in this issue so with that Mr
 
03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I I'm very grateful to the
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Moffett I
 
03:11:13.309 --> 03:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
reached out to him as the very first
 
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
person because I know he's a veteran and
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
I'm very grateful for his service I
 
03:11:19.349 --> 03:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
thought he would know more and I'm I'm
 
03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
very grateful that this is not only a
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill but I feel a nonpartisan
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
issue because we are just trying to find
 
03:11:27.990 --> 03:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
something that works for the residents
 
03:11:31.070 --> 03:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
of north of excuse me of New Hampshire
 
03:11:33.469 --> 03:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
and with that I will take any questions
 
03:11:35.710 --> 03:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
but we'll probably defer all of them to
 
03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
the gentlemen behind me just a reminder
 
03:11:40.349 --> 03:11:40.359 align:start position:0%

is the house custom that when
 
03:12:33.469 --> 03:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
Representatives have filled out a pink
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
card they go near the top because they
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
have other pressing duties in the house
 
03:12:43.030 --> 03:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:45.389 --> 03:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
jurus and every time I hear about the
 
03:12:51.110 --> 03:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you I I do
 
03:12:56.910 --> 03:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
miss it uh uh except maybe on days that
 
03:12:58.750 --> 03:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
are around Z degrees and the trains
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't uh don't like to get out of the
 
03:13:03.389 --> 03:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
out of the yard on on days like or
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
mornings like today but uh uh Lou jerus
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%

thank you for having me here right
 
03:13:15.910 --> 03:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the HB 170 I think it's um
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's a start and rethinking
 
03:13:19.389 --> 03:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
thinking the retirement benefit division
 
03:13:22.830 --> 03:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
in in matters of divorce uh with you
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
know with the idea
 
03:13:27.750 --> 03:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
of creating some more parity or at least
 
03:13:30.269 --> 03:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
relieving some of the burden for life
 
03:13:33.469 --> 03:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
from the actual from the pensioner um in
 
03:13:35.070 --> 03:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
the case of military pensions like in
 
03:13:37.830 --> 03:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
all pensions uh in New Hampshire the
 
03:13:39.790 --> 03:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
receiving you know spouse is entitled to
 
03:13:41.830 --> 03:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
after a long-term marriage entitled to
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
50% um that would be the marital portion
 
03:13:47.790 --> 03:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
as as you know defined by the
 
03:13:49.990 --> 03:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
by the Hoskins rule if it's less than
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
50% they would run that formula through
 
03:13:55.309 --> 03:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
and and and to determine the amount of
 
03:13:58.750 --> 03:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh of the monthly amount um uh unlike
 
03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
real property or unlike a checking
 
03:14:04.590 --> 03:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
account or uh other retirement like 401k
 
03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:05.790 align:start position:0%
account or uh other retirement like 401k
or

03:14:05.790 --> 03:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:14:09.229 --> 03:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
457b you don't just the deal just isn't
 
03:14:12.510 --> 03:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
done and you move on this is a monthly
 
03:14:14.790 --> 03:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
thing that that goes on in
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
perpetuity um once the quadr was done
 
03:14:22.510 --> 03:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
and uh you uh are ready to sell either a
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
home or ready to separate a checking
 
03:14:27.550 --> 03:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
accounts or savings accounts um those
 
03:14:30.750 --> 03:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
things end but this you know the monthly
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
payments come every month and uh you
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
know after a while this this could
 
03:14:39.030 --> 03:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
create imbalances with especially the
 
03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
pensioner but also maybe even the person
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
receiving former spouse receiving the
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
pension um so there is no end dat and um
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
unlike alimony or unlike child support
 
03:14:54.670 --> 03:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
there's a means test um you know it's
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's you you rule according to the rule
 
03:15:00.229 --> 03:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
125a you give you about your assets you
 
03:15:01.550 --> 03:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
you give how much you make what your
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
burdens are financially and they come up
 
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
with a formula and in and in cases of
 
03:15:08.910 --> 03:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
alimony it's it's usually a negotiated
 
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
thing the the the one of the spouses is
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to need some money for a
 
03:15:14.429 --> 03:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
particular period of time and that
 
03:15:18.030 --> 03:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
sunsets after uh after 10 years
 
03:15:21.150 --> 03:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
um uh you know on so on the flip side of
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
this too um we have to be careful I mean
 
03:15:27.229 --> 03:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
it it would be good to have a statute
 
03:15:30.070 --> 03:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
that maybe like was said earlier that
 
03:15:33.630 --> 03:15:33.640 align:start position:0%
judges could uh take have more leeway in
 
03:15:35.950 --> 03:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
where uh the receiving spouse if they
 
03:15:37.790 --> 03:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
were in the home they were taking care
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the children uh do doing various
 
03:15:44.990 --> 03:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
other functions um would should have a a
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
decent uh probably be considered for a
 
03:15:51.670 --> 03:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
good amount of that that pension uh or
 
03:15:56.110 --> 03:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
or somewhere uh that approach is half um
 
03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
it all should be considered if that
 
03:15:59.630 --> 03:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
spouse who is who wasn't in the military
 
03:16:01.269 --> 03:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
or anywhere else if they have a pension
 
03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
to and what their retirement benefits
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
are um so having that kind of U uh say
 
03:16:09.189 --> 03:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
in in how these things are are portioned
 
03:16:11.070 --> 03:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
out how the pensions are portioned out
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
is is important um uh so you you know
 
03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
the 50% AF for a long-term marriage can
 
03:16:20.670 --> 03:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
again should be looked at I think this
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
this HB 170 is is a good first step so
 
03:16:26.189 --> 03:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
keep in mind too that everything a lot
 
03:16:31.070 --> 03:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
of these m a lot of the assets and um
 
03:16:33.389 --> 03:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
whether they're tangible or intangible
 
03:16:36.830 --> 03:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
you can negotiate these things if the
 
03:16:39.389 --> 03:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
parties or one of the parties or both
 
03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
parties are willing to negotiate in some
 
03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:43.510 align:start position:0%
parties are willing to negotiate in some
cases

03:16:43.510 --> 03:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
cases
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
where the law is on the side of the
 
03:16:48.030 --> 03:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
person who has less
 
03:16:52.349 --> 03:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
assets and the statute says 50% of let's
 
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
say in this 50% of the pension there's
 
03:16:54.560 --> 03:16:56.110 align:start position:0%
say in this 50% of the pension there's
no

03:16:56.110 --> 03:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:16:59.790 --> 03:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
real compelling reason to negotiate when
 
03:17:01.710 --> 03:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
you know if you go forward in court
 
03:17:04.070 --> 03:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to get the 50% of
 
03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
the of the pension and that's the reason
 
03:17:09.550 --> 03:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
for maybe having a statute that either
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
takes the pension off the table or at
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
least there's more there's allow there's
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
more leeway allowed again you can you
 
03:17:19.550 --> 03:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
can take less child support you can take
 
03:17:21.389 --> 03:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
less alimony than you're entitled to you
 
03:17:22.990 --> 03:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
can take less than half the portion of
 
03:17:25.229 --> 03:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
your house if people are willing to
 
03:17:26.790 --> 03:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
negotiate you make a settlement and just
 
03:17:28.110 --> 03:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
bring it forward to the court and it's
 
03:17:30.510 --> 03:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
done but there are cases where it's not
 
03:17:34.189 --> 03:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
it's contentious and um I I can see why
 
03:17:36.030 --> 03:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
in in a scenario with a pension it would
 
03:17:38.910 --> 03:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
it would go the it would go far in the
 
03:17:42.269 --> 03:17:42.279 align:start position:0%
process um keep in mind too that you
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
know you can get your representation a
 
03:17:46.030 --> 03:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
lot of times attorneys in these law
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
firms will ad ized that they uh they're
 
03:17:50.870 --> 03:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
good at extracting assets and good at
 
03:17:52.870 --> 03:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
extracting especially pensions to some
 
03:17:55.870 --> 03:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
law firms it seems like the Crown Jewel
 
03:17:57.309 --> 03:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
that you know if you come with me I'll
 
03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
be able to get as much of your uh I'll
 
03:18:01.110 --> 03:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
be able to get as much of this pension
 
03:18:05.309 --> 03:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
for you as possible etc etc uh and that
 
03:18:08.349 --> 03:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
I I you see that uh when it comes down
 
03:18:10.349 --> 03:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
to these mediation and some of these
 
03:18:12.990 --> 03:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are in family law as well
 
03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh and you got to be careful not to get
 
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
hustled either while trying to make a
 
03:18:19.389 --> 03:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
need to wrap it up now Y and uh with
 
03:18:22.110 --> 03:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
that any questions do we have questions
 
03:18:22.120 --> 03:18:23.590 align:start position:0%
that any questions do we have questions
representative

03:18:23.590 --> 03:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
sure um are you aware of how other
 
03:18:32.429 --> 03:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
states handle this situation and all the
 
03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
testimony I've heard so far from from
 
03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm able to see it's pretty similar
 
03:18:40.389 --> 03:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
from what I understand I'm I'm not an
 
03:18:42.189 --> 03:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
expert but I from what I understand it's
 
03:18:44.030 --> 03:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
pretty similar they
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
just it's just half and there's no
 
03:18:52.510 --> 03:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's no income test if you will uh it
 
03:18:54.510 --> 03:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't consider other assets or what
 
03:18:57.990 --> 03:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
you make later in life whether you re
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
you maybe you remarry you live with
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else and you're getting two
 
03:19:03.790 --> 03:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
grand a year on top of your $80,000
 
03:19:06.229 --> 03:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
salary and anyway you know the scenarios
 
03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
are are you know they are what they are
 
03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh other questions anyone else with a
 
03:19:15.870 --> 03:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
question representative Raymond thank
 
03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
you um so I'm confused about the intent
 
03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
of the language change because um and so
 
03:19:25.229 --> 03:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
maybe you can clarify it for me because
 
03:19:28.510 --> 03:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
back if we go back to the 70s military
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
pensions were not considered assets and
 
03:19:32.309 --> 03:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
so they weren't part of a divorce
 
03:19:34.550 --> 03:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
process so a parent who had been staying
 
03:19:36.830 --> 03:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
home taking care of the kids while the
 
03:19:38.750 --> 03:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
spouse was in the military got zero
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
dollars of the pension then in
 
03:19:44.830 --> 03:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
1982 the um us former spouses protection
 
03:19:47.550 --> 03:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
Act was passed which allowed States to
 
03:19:51.269 --> 03:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
consider the pensions in the divorce
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
decree but it doesn't require a specific
 
03:19:56.229 --> 03:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
amount so if we change this language
 
03:19:58.189 --> 03:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
will this language change still give
 
03:20:02.229 --> 03:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
judges the discretion to do 10% or 5% or
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
whatever depending on the length of the
 
03:20:05.229 --> 03:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
marriage and the amount of time that the
 
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
other spouse was out of the workforce or
 
03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
would this go back to the 70s where the
 
03:20:12.550 --> 03:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
spouse gets nothing because the way I
 
03:20:15.070 --> 03:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
read the language is it does not include
 
03:20:17.189 --> 03:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
would mean that the judge couldn't order
 
03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
any of
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
it the best I can give is that's how it
 
03:20:26.790 --> 03:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
looks I I'm not familiar with the the
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
structuring of the bill okay that's what
 
03:20:32.349 --> 03:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
it and again if earlier when I mentioned
 
03:20:35.550 --> 03:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
giving the court leeway to make
 
03:20:37.229 --> 03:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
adjustments for exactly what your

rethinking the
 
03:23:18.880 --> 03:23:20.469 align:start position:0%
rethinking the
way

03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%

retired pay because that changes the
 
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
entire trajectory trajectory of the
 
03:23:44.269 --> 03:23:44.279 align:start position:0%

bill personally in that I was married

if you would like I can address
 
03:24:53.790 --> 03:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
specifically the military the depos
 
03:24:56.110 --> 03:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
military pay issue
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
essentially and I appreciate the
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
comments made by the previous gentleman
 
03:25:03.150 --> 03:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative mil disposable
 
03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
military pay is basically the retired
 
03:25:08.309 --> 03:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
pay which is based on a number of years
 
03:25:10.870 --> 03:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
of service and rank of the individual
 
03:25:14.389 --> 03:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
minus a insurance program that benefits
 
03:25:15.950 --> 03:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
the spouse it's called The spouse's
 
03:25:18.990 --> 03:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
benefit program SBP and essentially is
 
03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh life insurance for the spouse both
 
03:25:24.389 --> 03:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
former spouses and regular spouses so
 
03:25:27.189 --> 03:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's shared between the two parties it
 
03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
then is also subject to uh subtraction
 
03:25:34.229 --> 03:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
of any disability pay that the service
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
member retired service member has uh and
 
03:25:38.950 --> 03:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
this was recently upheld this specific
 
03:25:40.750 --> 03:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
language and this handling of it being
 
03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
mandatorily excluded was just upheld by
 
03:25:45.750 --> 03:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court about 5 years ago
 
03:25:47.389 --> 03:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
so that's where you get the
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
Disposable uh retirement pay uh
 
03:25:53.710 --> 03:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
emphasize the word retirement pay uh I
 
03:25:55.630 --> 03:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
think representative Raymond for her
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
quote to the history of this the U eisa
 
03:25:59.910 --> 03:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
as we say the uniform services former
 
03:26:04.189 --> 03:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
spouses protection act in that nowhere
 
03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
in there does it say the word pension
 
03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
military retirement pay is not a
 
03:26:14.550 --> 03:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
pension it is money earned by the
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
military member retired military member
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
and in the language of both the New
 
03:26:22.750 --> 03:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court I believe uh but
 
03:26:24.189 --> 03:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme
 
03:26:27.510 --> 03:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
Court it is reduced compensation for
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
reduced service the military member is
 
03:26:33.469 --> 03:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
subject to mandatory
 
03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
recall I as a retired officer retired
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
regular officer I have no choice if I am
 
03:26:42.550 --> 03:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
recalled I must serve my specialty has
 
03:26:44.429 --> 03:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
been recalled in previous Wars I was an
 
03:26:47.150 --> 03:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
electronic warfare officer uh which is a
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
very very highly Technical and
 
03:26:51.309 --> 03:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
specialized field but again remember I'm
 
03:26:53.110 --> 03:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
speaking not for the Air Force I'm
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
speaking on my own personal
 
03:26:56.279 --> 03:26:58.389 align:start position:0%
speaking on my own personal
uh

03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:27:00.830 --> 03:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
interests so uh as we talked about the
 
03:27:02.670 --> 03:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
history of this and it follows a US
 
03:27:04.670 --> 03:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision in 1981 called
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
McCarthy B McCartney that held that for
 
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
various reasons and they did the
 
03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
analysis now in introducing this bill we
 
03:27:13.750 --> 03:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
introduce you to the concept the fact
 
03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
that the terms
 
03:27:19.950 --> 03:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
the military retirement pay as property
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
for purposes of divorce settlement and
 
03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
then it flips right back and it's taxed
 
03:27:29.830 --> 03:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
as pay to us so we look at it first as
 
03:27:31.469 --> 03:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
property and then we look at as pay and
 
03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
then it changes back again it could be
 
03:27:35.429 --> 03:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
used for various things I'd like to
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
stress now right now that we are not
 
03:27:40.229 --> 03:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
advocating for two things we are not
 
03:27:42.269 --> 03:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
advocating for any changes to child
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
support in any ways anything that would
 
03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
harm children nor are we against the
 
03:27:49.750 --> 03:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
concept of alimony determined by a judge
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
as appropriate in the circumstances we
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
are against mandatory non-changing
 
03:27:55.800 --> 03:27:58.550 align:start position:0%
are against mandatory non-changing
non-terminating

03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
non-terminating
 
03:28:01.309 --> 03:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
payments as I said I was divorced in New
 
03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2001 I am still after 24
 
03:28:07.150 --> 03:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
years of divorce still paying my ex-wife
 
03:28:11.110 --> 03:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
$2,000 a month I've paid in excess of
 
03:28:15.150 --> 03:28:15.160 align:start position:0%
$400,000 in this payment when does it
 
03:28:18.070 --> 03:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
stop okay when does it stop how much
 
03:28:20.070 --> 03:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
longer am I going to be paying this if
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
you look you've asked about the uh
 
03:28:25.790 --> 03:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
what's handled Nationwide the states
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
look at it very differently effect
 
03:28:30.189 --> 03:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
effectively in Texas there is no alimony
 
03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
anymore some other states are limiting
 
03:28:34.910 --> 03:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
it now the trend and you compos very
 
03:28:36.510 --> 03:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
very appropriately and I thank you for
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
that in 1970 1980 lifetime lifetime
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
alimony was very common then it's much
 
03:28:46.990 --> 03:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
less common today in fact and we know at
 
03:28:48.670 --> 03:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
least seven states have specifically put
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
on there that lifetime alimony will no
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
longer be granted five years is a very
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
common thing because alimony is designed
 
03:28:58.590 --> 03:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
to be rehabilitative okay meaning that
 
03:29:00.389 --> 03:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's a chance for the spouse to make up
 
03:29:03.309 --> 03:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
for any any benefits lost to go to
 
03:29:05.710 --> 03:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
school to get a skill to get a job and I
 
03:29:07.990 --> 03:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
think is very appropriate as was said
 
03:29:10.269 --> 03:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
before I think our characterization of
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
this is not taking anything away in fact
 
03:29:15.630 --> 03:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
we're giving greater Al giving greater
 
03:29:19.550 --> 03:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
opportun to judges to create a
 
03:29:23.070 --> 03:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
specific solution to each specific
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
situation but what I tell you that the
 
03:29:28.910 --> 03:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
languages it currently now does is
 
03:29:31.590 --> 03:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
03:29:34.510 --> 03:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
female uh service members right now they
 
03:29:37.590 --> 03:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
comp compose about 18% of the Armed for
 
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
armed services the United States and of
 
03:29:42.229 --> 03:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
that 250,000 people I've talked about
 
03:29:43.830 --> 03:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
whose interests I represent to some
 
03:29:47.590 --> 03:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
extent they're about 18% % of that is no
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
what this what if you don't change the
 
03:29:53.349 --> 03:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
bill what happens for a div
 
03:29:57.950 --> 03:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
divorced single mom who is having to pay
 
03:30:01.150 --> 03:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
this money if she was abused in her
 
03:30:03.550 --> 03:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
marriage she is now forced to pay her
 
03:30:06.429 --> 03:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
abuser for Lifetime forced to pay her
 
03:30:07.510 --> 03:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
abuser for
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
lifetime because the way it's
 
03:30:11.150 --> 03:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
interpreted and applied in the states
 
03:30:12.750 --> 03:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
and most New Hampshire courts through my
 
03:30:16.110 --> 03:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
experience you have that situation again
 
03:30:17.990 --> 03:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
we are trying to give more flexibility
 
03:30:20.229 --> 03:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
in this if it's property then it should
 
03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
be property if it's income it should be
 
03:30:26.110 --> 03:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
income so I and the previous gentleman
 
03:30:27.670 --> 03:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative characteriz this this
 
03:30:29.309 --> 03:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing thing for those of you
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with the divorce process when
 
03:30:34.590 --> 03:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
we look at the marital assets for most
 
03:30:36.830 --> 03:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
people they have pension plans that are
 
03:30:39.510 --> 03:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
subject to RIS urisa which is the the
 
03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
national law on that military retirement
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
pay is not a RIS of plan it has no value
 
03:30:47.189 --> 03:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
it has nothing can be divorced one time
 
03:30:49.349 --> 03:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
major white we're coming up on a uh a
 
03:30:52.030 --> 03:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
bump to the next hearing so uh would you
 
03:30:55.550 --> 03:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
take some questions please seem to have
 
03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
the answers representative D
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
is this uh disposable retired pay
 
03:31:11.590 --> 03:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
considered taxable income via the
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
federal government on a 1040 yes ma'am
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually not on a 1040 4 on a 1099
 
03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
1099 thank you representative Raymond
 
03:31:24.429 --> 03:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
thank you so under the current language
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
does the judge have the discretion to
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
order 0% or 5% or some other number that
 
03:31:32.670 --> 03:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
isn't 50% the judge has that but there's
 
03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
an understanding that with this language
 
03:31:38.110 --> 03:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
in the bill that many state court judges
 
03:31:39.309 --> 03:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
and I've talked to many of them all
 
03:31:41.269 --> 03:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
across the nation they think they're
 
03:31:43.630 --> 03:31:43.640 align:start position:0%
actually required
 
03:31:46.110 --> 03:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
to theoretically though a judge could do
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
that but I've not heard of anyone doing
 
03:31:51.150 --> 03:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
that quite frankly thank you anyone else
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative how do I pronounce
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%

03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you m Mr chairman uh thank you
 
03:32:03.950 --> 03:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
for your presentation I just want to
 
03:32:07.070 --> 03:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
know like you say you you are divorce
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
with your wife and then you continue to
 
03:32:13.630 --> 03:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
to pay and the wife even the the wife is
 
03:32:16.429 --> 03:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
married or have someone
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
has this is unlike normal divorces where
 
03:32:23.790 --> 03:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:26.670 --> 03:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
remarriage now the other thing is is my
 
03:32:28.870 --> 03:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
wife completed a successful career my
 
03:32:30.550 --> 03:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
ex-wife completed a successful career as
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
a uh teacher here in New Hampshire she's
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
retired she has her own pension from
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
that her pension could not be considered
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
in the divorce because of New Hampshire
 
03:32:43.710 --> 03:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
law so mine was hers wasn't and mine's
 
03:32:46.349 --> 03:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
not even a pension
 
03:32:49.630 --> 03:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
if I violate this if I no longer become
 
03:32:51.389 --> 03:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
eligible for military service I go to a
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
different country I renounce my American
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
citizenship my payments are done I have
 
03:32:58.590 --> 03:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
to be available to serve in the military
 
03:33:00.189 --> 03:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
she has no such
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
condition representative
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
rice thank you Mr chairman so in
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
deciding when the spouse gets the half
 
03:33:15.070 --> 03:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
of the of the the Disposable retired pay
 
03:33:16.510 --> 03:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
is there a certain certain length of
 
03:33:19.950 --> 03:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
time the marriage had to be intact well
 
03:33:21.990 --> 03:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
not really ma'am but under the under the
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
eisa law for the federal government to
 
03:33:26.429 --> 03:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
recognize it there has to be an overlap
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
of 10 years of the military service and
 
03:33:31.309 --> 03:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
the marriage but that only affects the
 
03:33:32.710 --> 03:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
payment by the federal government
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
directly to the EXP spouse um some State
 
03:33:38.670 --> 03:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
Court judges have said that that doesn't
 
03:33:41.150 --> 03:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
apply to state law and will order the
 
03:33:42.830 --> 03:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
division anyways but under the federal
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
law there should be the 10-year overlap
 
03:33:46.550 --> 03:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
between the milit service in the
 
03:33:50.070 --> 03:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
marriage thank you and if if I may if I
 
03:33:52.309 --> 03:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
keep that if that's meant by the way
 
03:33:55.950 --> 03:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
military espouses remain eligible for
 
03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
Commissary for medical care for dental
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
care under the armed for services they
 
03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't lose that and we are not
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
contesting that in any way
 
03:34:06.630 --> 03:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
03:34:07.710 --> 03:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for the
 
03:34:09.510 --> 03:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
explanation and for your testimony and
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in looking I just
 
03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
looked up some stuff I'm having a hard
 
03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
time wrapping my brain about the uh
 
03:34:16.990 --> 03:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
disposal retired pay and I think I have
 
03:34:18.670 --> 03:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
a comprehension of it but one of the
 
03:34:20.910 --> 03:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
things that it's used to pay is child
 
03:34:25.469 --> 03:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
support alimony or divide property so in
 
03:34:27.630 --> 03:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
this case and and by the way in many
 
03:34:31.229 --> 03:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
divorces there's alimony whatever
 
03:34:34.030 --> 03:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
else what if this is what's usually to
 
03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
pay for this how would the person
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
because you're you're upset I mean I
 
03:34:39.309 --> 03:34:39.319 align:start position:0%
understand that you've been paying
 
03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
alimon for a very long time and that's a
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
what how does alimony get paid than
 
03:34:47.710 --> 03:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise would it just not come out of
 
03:34:50.389 --> 03:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
this because many I know a lot of people
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the military um who their spouse is
 
03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
not working because of the travel and
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
everything else and raising the kids so
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
they sacrifice their occupation to
 
03:35:03.389 --> 03:35:03.399 align:start position:0%
uphold their spouses occupation and help
 
03:35:05.349 --> 03:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
them with that so what what is the
 
03:35:07.710 --> 03:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
exchange on that or what's the because
 
03:35:09.870 --> 03:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
this I'm I'm seeing the same thing the
 
03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
shall not include so how do this get
 
03:35:15.269 --> 03:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
paid I I appreciate your situation but
 
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
not every spouse suffers in the military
 
03:35:21.469 --> 03:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
of a military member some
 
03:35:23.950 --> 03:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry I would just want to clarify
 
03:35:25.710 --> 03:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
for the record I did not say suffers at
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
all sacrific I mean not all of them do
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
not all of them sacrifice for something
 
03:35:31.389 --> 03:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
I mean they their careers go on
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
unimpeded and in fact the the laws uh
 
03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
federal laws over the last uh years or
 
03:35:38.189 --> 03:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
state laws for example they're
 
03:35:40.349 --> 03:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh transference of
 
03:35:42.269 --> 03:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
credentials such as for lawyers such for
 
03:35:44.349 --> 03:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
nurses much easier so they don't all
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
suffer and I think that goes back to the
 
03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
incident that each case is individual
 
03:35:50.429 --> 03:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
there should not be a blanket coodie
 
03:35:52.030 --> 03:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
cutter approach to it which we are
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid in this um now here's
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
where it flips from property to uh
 
03:35:59.950 --> 03:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
income that they do the property
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
division first okay which is the monthly
 
03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
income and this is monthly every month
 
03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's determined have the conditions been
 
03:36:10.469 --> 03:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
met has it's done so now after that now
 
03:36:12.670 --> 03:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
it flips back to income and they can
 
03:36:16.750 --> 03:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
compute child support and uh alimony if
 
03:36:18.630 --> 03:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate under state law after that
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
so the same pay is used twice it's
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
competed once for property and once for
 
03:36:26.950 --> 03:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
income we agree that that income
 
03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
characterization is appropriate and
 
03:36:31.229 --> 03:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
should be calculated as again I said
 
03:36:33.429 --> 03:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
we're not opposed to alimony as a
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
concept generally and certainly not
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to child support in any way so
 
03:36:39.630 --> 03:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
we're just opposed to the fact that it
 
03:36:42.670 --> 03:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
should not be first divided as property
 
03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
then what's left over is then divided as
 
03:36:51.189 --> 03:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:51.199 --> 03:36:52.750 align:start position:0%
 
last

03:36:52.750 --> 03:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:36:55.750 --> 03:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
call thank you major for your testimony
 
03:36:58.110 --> 03:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
and appreciate it appreciate the
 
03:36:59.389 --> 03:36:59.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to everybody thank
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%

service sir it was
 
03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's the hardest part of testifying
 
03:37:24.510 --> 03:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's turning the light on you'll see a
 
03:37:26.510 --> 03:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
little red light which means you've won
 
03:37:30.030 --> 03:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
oh red is good thank you I was I saw it
 
03:37:32.429 --> 03:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
red and I turned it right off that's the
 
03:37:33.750 --> 03:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's the hard part that was there we
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
go so my name's Anna gay Zimmerman um
 
03:37:38.830 --> 03:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
and I am here today because I practice
 
03:37:41.309 --> 03:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
family law for a very long time stopped
 
03:37:45.070 --> 03:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
doing it about a year and a half ago um
 
03:37:46.830 --> 03:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
which is much less stressful in my
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
personal life but I have a very I I did
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of work with military def pensions
 
03:37:53.550 --> 03:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
I represented a lot of military members
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
and I represented a lot of military
 
03:37:57.750 --> 03:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
spouses uh I wrote a paper several years
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
ago many years ago now called divorce in
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
the trenches and I you know I've
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
testified as an expert on how when a a
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
pension can be divided how it gets
 
03:38:10.030 --> 03:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
divided things like that um I am also a
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
former military
 
03:38:15.630 --> 03:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
spouse um divorced also I will say that
 
03:38:16.830 --> 03:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
that my ex-husband was not in the
 
03:38:18.550 --> 03:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
military long enough we had about eight
 
03:38:20.590 --> 03:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
years so we did not have any issue of
 
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
dividing up pensions I did not have so I
 
03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:23.590 align:start position:0%
dividing up pensions I did not have so I
have

03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
no I don't know dog in this fight so to
 
03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
speak but I have a lot of concerns about
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
this bill so let me talk and I know I
 
03:38:31.469 --> 03:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
only got three minutes so I'm going to
 
03:38:34.229 --> 03:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
try to talk real big picture first um
 
03:38:35.790 --> 03:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
you've talked about what disposable
 
03:38:38.830 --> 03:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
retirement pay is we take the entire
 
03:38:41.950 --> 03:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit we reduce the SBB
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
premium if an SBP is being awarded and
 
03:38:46.590 --> 03:38:46.600 align:start position:0%
or has been agreed upon that's the
 
03:38:49.150 --> 03:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
Survivor benefit if it's not then that
 
03:38:51.870 --> 03:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen a big one that comes out
 
03:38:55.189 --> 03:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
though is um any amounts getting paid
 
03:38:58.710 --> 03:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
for VA uh benefits or VA disability so
 
03:39:01.710 --> 03:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
you might have a $4,000 pension
 
03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
someone's got a 25% VA disability and
 
03:39:08.750 --> 03:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
that pensions getting reduced by $600 a
 
03:39:11.070 --> 03:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
month $700 a month something like that
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
that is now um since a case called how
 
03:39:16.510 --> 03:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
versus howl US Supreme court case in
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
2017 since that time that military
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
pension doesn't get divided our state
 
03:39:23.389 --> 03:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
court doesn't have an option on that
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
that that that portion of the military
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
pension it's called a VA waiver
 
03:39:29.510 --> 03:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
basically you get the money U from the
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
VA instead it becomes non- taxable but
 
03:39:34.189 --> 03:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
it gets deducted from your military
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
pension for people who have a disability
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
over 50% it's different it's paid on top
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
but that's how it works for those kind
 
03:39:43.389 --> 03:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
of lower rating disabilities so that is
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
already moved over here on the and put
 
03:39:48.349 --> 03:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
in the pile of the military spouse can't
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
be touched by the court for the purposes
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
of property division what this bill is
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
proposing is that then well then what
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
happens is we look at all the pensions
 
03:39:59.790 --> 03:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
all the retirement benefits that are
 
03:40:01.630 --> 03:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
available to be divided this gentleman
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
who just talk spoke talked about his
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
wife's teacher retirement the only way
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
that was not subject to this court the
 
03:40:11.189 --> 03:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
Court's division is if it was if it was
 
03:40:13.510 --> 03:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
acquired either before or after the
 
03:40:15.550 --> 03:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
marriage otherwise she would would have
 
03:40:18.349 --> 03:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
been entitled to her Hodgkin share a
 
03:40:19.670 --> 03:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of the share that was
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
accumulated during the marriage the
 
03:40:23.309 --> 03:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
exact same thing happens with the
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
military retirement the only thing the
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
court is devel is dividing up is the
 
03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
share that was accumulated during the
 
03:40:32.070 --> 03:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
marriage and it treats the military
 
03:40:34.349 --> 03:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
retirement just like it does another
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
pension because they're inherently hard
 
03:40:39.550 --> 03:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
to Value hod the Hodgkins case talks
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
about this as soon as the military
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
member dies the value disappears so as
 
03:40:47.950 --> 03:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
as do many pensions um even the state
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
ones we often see yeah it's got some
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
cash value but that is not remotely
 
03:40:54.510 --> 03:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
close to the full value of the pension
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
and and the pension continues to pay out
 
03:40:59.670 --> 03:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
over the years until someone passes away
 
03:41:02.429 --> 03:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
so those get divided regardless of who
 
03:41:05.150 --> 03:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
owns them a teacher I just didn't want
 
03:41:06.510 --> 03:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
there to be any confusion that a
 
03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
teacher's salary or a teacher's pension
 
03:41:09.870 --> 03:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
might not be subject to the court
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
because they all are what they're asking
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
you to do now though is carve out the
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
military pension and I think if anything
 
03:41:20.269 --> 03:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
this is more it is not giving the court
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
leeway to reduce amounts like is being
 
03:41:25.870 --> 03:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
suggested it is saying it does not count
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
it like the um VA money it is getting
 
03:41:33.070 --> 03:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
put in a separate pile not part of the
 
03:41:34.950 --> 03:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
property division not subject to
 
03:41:37.389 --> 03:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
Equitable division we already have a
 
03:41:39.149 --> 03:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
provision that allows the court to do
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
something Equitable that's different
 
03:41:43.469 --> 03:41:43.479 align:start position:0%
than 5050 the starting presumption in
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that 5050 is is what's
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
Equitable but the court is allowed to
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
deviate from that so if we've got the
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
abused spouse who's been beaten by her
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
husband who's raising a kid alone he's
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
not allowed to see the kids anymore and
 
03:41:58.469 --> 03:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
he's got you know she has a very very
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
low-paying job and he's got a
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
high-paying job the court can already
 
03:42:04.189 --> 03:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
equate for that and give her more of
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
something to keep her be at her pension
 
03:42:08.790 --> 03:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
or something else to adjust for this the
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
one thing I would say about that is
 
03:42:13.349 --> 03:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
federal law does not allow for more than
 
03:42:16.590 --> 03:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
50% of the Disposable retire pay to be
 
03:42:19.950 --> 03:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
allocated to the uh non-military spouse
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
so there is a cap it can't be more than
 
03:42:24.149 --> 03:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
that although that could happen with
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
other pens other types of Pensions um my
 
03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
experience as a military
 
03:42:32.950 --> 03:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
spouse and it's a little con concerning
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
to me to hear the characterizations of
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
of military spouses because it is a true
 
03:42:41.389 --> 03:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
partnership I have many many many
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
friends who have been at home losing
 
03:42:47.349 --> 03:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
sleep taking care of kids for you know
 
03:42:49.830 --> 03:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
multiple years will they had deployed
 
03:42:52.750 --> 03:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
husbands or wives not sure if those
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
people were going to come home to them
 
03:42:57.309 --> 03:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
who are getting moved every few years to
 
03:43:00.030 --> 03:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
a new Duty station who never stay long
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
enough somewhere to get their own
 
03:43:04.950 --> 03:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
pension built up somewhere or retirement
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
because they are as committed to that
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
job and their country as their spouses
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
and that is just part of the military
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
lifestyle um I only lived at for short
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
period of time compared to what a lot of
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
people live it but people are living
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
that every single day and this is not
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
alimony for life this is a benefit that
 
03:43:26.429 --> 03:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
you accumulate just like any other
 
03:43:28.830 --> 03:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
pension just like any state retirement
 
03:43:30.269 --> 03:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
that you accumulate as part of your
 
03:43:33.790 --> 03:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
service and this law would take strip
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
that right from those military spouses
 
03:43:37.590 --> 03:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
and treat it different than everything
 
03:43:39.309 --> 03:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
else that I know I'm out of time so out
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
of time would did you take some
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%

03:45:04.189 --> 03:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
better an impact we get together we take
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
a position on those bills and then I
 
03:45:08.229 --> 03:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
come and I Tell You Folks what our
 
03:45:10.590 --> 03:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
position on those things is we're we're
 
03:45:13.309 --> 03:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
actually uh chartered by state law RSA
 
03:45:16.110 --> 03:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
115 col and a 8 if you want to read up
 
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
on us you can also get get a uh get to
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
us through the the department of
 
03:45:22.510 --> 03:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services

website you can also get through us that
 
03:45:26.950 --> 03:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
way we in the State Vet advisory
 
03:45:28.990 --> 03:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee had the language on this bill
 
03:45:30.790 --> 03:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
we did not take a position on it we were
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
very uh hesitant to do that so our
 
03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
official position is that we're
 
03:45:38.110 --> 03:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
following this bill meaning we're just
 
03:45:40.030 --> 03:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
going to wait and see which direction
 
03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
that the wind blows okay so the official
 
03:45:47.309 --> 03:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
sbac position is that this uh that we're
 
03:45:48.389 --> 03:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
going to follow this and see what
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
happens now with your permission I would
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
like to take off my state veterans
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
advisory committee hat and talk to you
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%

representative of uh of myself in the
 
03:46:03.070 --> 03:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
town of hooks at New Hampshire the chair
 
03:46:06.189 --> 03:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
considers you now hatless thank you sir
 
03:46:09.149 --> 03:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I am like a previous
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
person here uh divorced I have been
 
03:46:16.030 --> 03:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
paying a a percentage of my military
 
03:46:19.149 --> 03:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
retirement uh to a former spouse for a
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
lot of years now and the situation that
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
happened when I got married or when I
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
got divorced was that I still had
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
approximately eight or nine more years
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
on active duty before any of this
 
03:46:34.269 --> 03:46:34.279 align:start position:0%
started happening okay what I wanted to
 
03:46:35.910 --> 03:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
do is kind of bring you up to speed a
 
03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
little bit on on what's in the former
 
03:46:39.990 --> 03:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
spouse's protection act why did it
 
03:46:41.830 --> 03:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
happen and and what changes have been
 
03:46:45.429 --> 03:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
made to it to make it Equitable um the
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
it was passed in late ' 81 and it became
 
03:46:50.269 --> 03:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
effective in in 1982 and what it was
 
03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
meant to do is protect that military
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
spouse that bounced around and bounced
 
03:46:55.590 --> 03:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
around and bounced around you know and
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
they they were in the military for 25
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
years together and then at that point
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
they get divorced and here's somebody
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
who's 45 years old with no work
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
experience no work history no pension no
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
nothing that now is sitting out there so
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
this this former spouse's Act was set up
 
03:47:13.870 --> 03:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
to protect that person from uh from that
 
03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
happening and
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
essentially it has been revised in 1986
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
they they they took the disability pay
 
03:47:23.630 --> 03:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
out of there and with the
 
03:47:27.389 --> 03:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
2017 um uh National Defense
 
03:47:29.309 --> 03:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
authorization act they did something
 
03:47:31.469 --> 03:47:31.479 align:start position:0%
that that actually would have helped me
 
03:47:33.469 --> 03:47:33.479 align:start position:0%
uh I got divorced as a relatively Junior
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
major and I retired as a colonel and my
 
03:47:38.550 --> 03:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
former spouse is getting retirement pay
 
03:47:41.469 --> 03:47:41.479 align:start position:0%
at the colonel rate okay that would have
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
helped me but that you're that's not
 
03:47:46.670 --> 03:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
applicable because only divorces after
 
03:47:50.429 --> 03:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
2017 are covered by this latest change
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay now I I view that whole situation
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
as not everybody is made to be married
 
03:47:58.670 --> 03:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
to somebody that's in the military and
 
03:48:00.189 --> 03:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
better to find out you know sooner than
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
later okay and and what what the what
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
the law generally allowed for was either
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
a lumpsum amount every month that could
 
03:48:10.229 --> 03:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
be agreed upon or it allowed for a
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
percentage and typically the percentage
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
is we start with 50% for the member and
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
then they do just a pretty much how many
 
03:48:18.590 --> 03:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
years were you married to this person
 
03:48:20.189 --> 03:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
that's in the military well 10 how many
 
03:48:22.030 --> 03:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
years did they serve well 20 well you
 
03:48:24.910 --> 03:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
get you get 50% of the remaining half or
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
25% that's the way that the formulas
 
03:48:31.110 --> 03:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
tend to work on this kind of of
 
03:48:33.630 --> 03:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
legislation the the federal law as it's
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
already written and this is really
 
03:48:36.830 --> 03:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
important the federal law as it's
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
already written already gives a local
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
judge discretion to either include this
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
include this or not to follow formulas
 
03:48:46.710 --> 03:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
or not to make up their own percentage
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
what they think is fair based on the the
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances of each individual case
 
03:48:53.710 --> 03:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
that already exists in the law and as
 
03:48:55.870 --> 03:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
you have all pointed out that if you if
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
you pass this HB 170 you're you're
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
taking that off the table now um I have
 
03:49:05.309 --> 03:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh when I started talking at my house
 
03:49:08.550 --> 03:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
about this bill uh my my military spouse
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
wife got kind of fired up about it and
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
she would like to talk to you not
 
03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily next but at some point so
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's really
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
all I want to
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.469 --> 03:49:31.479 align:start position:0%
um I think my last pink card is Frank
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon committee members my
 
03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
name is Frank Kin I'm from Northampton
 
03:50:16.870 --> 03:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:19.630 --> 03:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
Ura Good Day committee members I stand
 
03:50:21.630 --> 03:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
before you today as a constituent of the
 
03:50:24.030 --> 03:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
Granite State my purpose is to request
 
03:50:25.910 --> 03:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
your consideration to listen and share
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
to an ongoing mission to write or wrong
 
03:50:31.269 --> 03:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
again I'm a retired military veteran of
 
03:50:34.269 --> 03:50:34.279 align:start position:0%
21 years and one of over 250,000
 
03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
retirees affected by the federal law 10
 
03:50:39.550 --> 03:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
US code 1408 payment of retired or
 
03:50:42.030 --> 03:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
retainer pay in compliance with court
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
orders the egregious result is that that
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years the law is literally
 
03:50:49.389 --> 03:50:49.399 align:start position:0%
picking the pockets of veterans and will
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
do for life I've been paying my former
 
03:50:53.469 --> 03:50:53.479 align:start position:0%
spouse longer than we were actually
 
03:50:55.469 --> 03:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
married she has since remarried and
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
divorced another military veteran and is
 
03:50:59.189 --> 03:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
currently in another long-term
 
03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
relationship and has inherited her
 
03:51:01.800 --> 03:51:02.990 align:start position:0%
relationship and has inherited her
father's

03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
father's
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
estate briefly I'd like to state that
 
03:51:07.030 --> 03:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire set
 
03:51:09.670 --> 03:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
precedents back in 1980 with the baker
 
03:51:11.950 --> 03:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
Baker decision and the baker Baker
 
03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
decision with military retirement prior
 
03:51:17.149 --> 03:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
to to the former spouse law states
 
03:51:19.389 --> 03:51:19.399 align:start position:0%
military retirement pay lacks the
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
following characteristics of property
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
cash surrender value loan value
 
03:51:27.790 --> 03:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
Redemption value lump sum value and
 
03:51:31.309 --> 03:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
value realizable after death that means
 
03:51:34.750 --> 03:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
that once I die my payments stop now if
 
03:51:37.469 --> 03:51:37.479 align:start position:0%
my former spouse passes away payments
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
revert back to me that's not the concept
 
03:51:41.710 --> 03:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
of property that would be like the boat
 
03:51:43.630 --> 03:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
at a house being awarded to my former
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
spouse she passes away and I go to her
 
03:51:49.030 --> 03:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
new husband and say hey I need that back
 
03:51:51.070 --> 03:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work that way retirement pay
 
03:51:54.070 --> 03:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
does that so it doesn't fit any kind of
 
03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
description of what property is yet it's
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
classified it magically turns into
 
03:52:01.870 --> 03:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
income first it's property or first it's
 
03:52:03.469 --> 03:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
income then it's property then it comes
 
03:52:05.750 --> 03:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
back to income again what this law is
 
03:52:09.389 --> 03:52:09.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do is level a playing field
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
take it off as property we have no
 
03:52:14.189 --> 03:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
problem using it as income to help a
 
03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
forance spouse out and provide for for
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
child care child support all it does is
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
it ends at one at one particular time
 
03:52:25.030 --> 03:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
alimony ends child support ends if you
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
take the if you divide the military
 
03:52:29.110 --> 03:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
retirement as property what's left and
 
03:52:32.149 --> 03:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
then tax it as alimon and child support
 
03:52:35.429 --> 03:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
there's no military retirement left now
 
03:52:37.389 --> 03:52:37.399 align:start position:0%
there's stipulations just as Larry
 
03:52:40.510 --> 03:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
stated out I'm subject to recall if I
 
03:52:43.309 --> 03:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
refuse recall they take my pay if I get
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for more than 30 days they
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
take my pay if I uh relinquish my
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
citizenship they take my pay they stop
 
03:52:54.030 --> 03:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
my pay if I go to work for the Saudi
 
03:52:55.630 --> 03:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
government fixing
 
03:52:57.990 --> 03:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
f-15s without a waiver from the
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of the Navy they stop my pay
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
now on the flip side if my former spouse
 
03:53:05.670 --> 03:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
was to say the heck with it I don't want
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
to be a US citizen I'm going to marry an
 
03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
Australian go live in Australia now
 
03:53:11.830 --> 03:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
she's an Australian citizen they send a
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
check to her bank account okay now she
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
gets tired of her husband and divorces
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
him or he has an accident she gets
 
03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in prison guess what they
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
send the checks right to the prison so
 
03:53:28.189 --> 03:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
this is the inequities that's with this
 
03:53:31.510 --> 03:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
this particular law um they saw fit back
 
03:53:33.550 --> 03:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
in the 70s to do that to kind of take
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
care of the former spouses that didn't
 
03:53:38.189 --> 03:53:38.199 align:start position:0%
have anything but times have changed uh
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
we have a lot more military veterans
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
that are female that are getting
 
03:53:44.510 --> 03:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
hammered by this law um the Abuse Act
 
03:53:46.510 --> 03:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
that involves a military retirement if
 
03:53:49.469 --> 03:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
the service member commits domestic
 
03:53:52.269 --> 03:53:52.279 align:start position:0%
violence they lose their retirement pay
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
yet the abused former spouse gets it now
 
03:53:59.269 --> 03:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
Flip Flip the rules if you have the
 
03:54:01.269 --> 03:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
service members being abused by the
 
03:54:01.279 --> 03:54:02.790 align:start position:0%
service members being abused by the
civilian

03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
civilian
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
spouse right and they get divorced you
 
03:54:07.830 --> 03:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
still have to pay that spouse that's
 
03:54:07.840 --> 03:54:08.870 align:start position:0%
still have to pay that spouse that's
abusing

03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
abusing
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
you it doesn't make sense so what we're
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
saying is the baker Baker
 
03:54:20.429 --> 03:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
law calls out hey it's not property it's
 
03:54:23.429 --> 03:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
income um I'll be happy to take any
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
kland seeing none thank you for your
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
service and thank you for coming today
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
we will not go to Executive session on
 
03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
this I think we need some more time to
 
03:54:54.429 --> 03:54:54.439 align:start position:0%
think it through this ends the hearing
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 170 and I now call
 
03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:01.710 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 170 and I now call
into

03:55:01.710 --> 03:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:55:04.269 --> 03:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
exist I do not have another pink card on
 
03:55:04.279 --> 03:55:09.349 align:start position:0%
exist I do not have another pink card on
this

03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.590 --> 03:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
okay I think it probably got combined
 
03:55:23.990 --> 03:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:30.110 --> 03:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:55:35.469 --> 03:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen I appreciate giving
 
03:55:37.229 --> 03:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
being given the opportunity to speak
 
03:55:39.870 --> 03:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
today my name is Roberta Grady and I am
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
a resident of
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
hookit I'm not going to speak directly
 
03:55:47.110 --> 03:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
to the law but I'm here to tell you my
 
03:55:49.590 --> 03:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
story so that you have an idea of what
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's like to be a military spouse and
 
03:55:55.870 --> 03:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
yes I was a military spouse a while ago
 
03:55:58.149 --> 03:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
but some things don't
 
03:55:59.910 --> 03:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
change in
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
1980 I became a military spouse for the
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
first time I was living here in New
 
03:56:07.830 --> 03:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was a retail manager and I
 
03:56:09.830 --> 03:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
was on the verge of a really great
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
promotion but I fell in love with a guy
 
03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
in the Army and I married him and moved
 
03:56:15.199 --> 03:56:16.189 align:start position:0%
in the Army and I married him and moved
to

03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
Alabama but it was a short-term move and
 
03:56:20.309 --> 03:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
I couldn't get a job it just wasn't
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
feasible it was only temporary so we
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
moved to Germany and I couldn't get a
 
03:56:27.070 --> 03:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
job in retailing because all of the
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
onbase jobs went to Germans per the
 
03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
status of forces agreement and off base
 
03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
I didn't speak German I wasn't going to
 
03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
get a job in a German store so what
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
could I do well I I was lucky I found a
 
03:56:43.149 --> 03:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
job I changed careers and I became a
 
03:56:44.910 --> 03:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
part-time instructor after working for a
 
03:56:47.950 --> 03:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
contractor for the army and eventually I
 
03:56:50.110 --> 03:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
did get promoted but there was no
 
03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
retirement plan for me there was no
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
pension for me with that job we stayed
 
03:56:57.990 --> 03:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
in Germany for 5 years which is at least
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
two years longer than most people get to
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
stay in any one area and we moved to
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
Texas and I was lucky once again I found
 
03:57:08.429 --> 03:57:08.439 align:start position:0%
a job but it was a part-time job no
 
03:57:12.149 --> 03:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
pension no promotion available for me so
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
I went to night school to get my
 
03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
Master's degree and while I was in
 
03:57:20.030 --> 03:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
school my husband who was deployed to to
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
um Honduras actually at the time called
 
03:57:24.910 --> 03:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
me and told me we were getting a divorce
 
03:57:27.429 --> 03:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
and I became very quickly a former
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
military spouse and by the way when I
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
was in Germany the first time I worked
 
03:57:33.389 --> 03:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
as a volunteer a lot with military
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
spouses and I was in favor of the former
 
03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
military spouse protection act never
 
03:57:39.389 --> 03:57:39.399 align:start position:0%
knowing that eventually maybe I might
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
need it but we weren't married long
 
03:57:44.429 --> 03:57:44.439 align:start position:0%
enough for me to take advantage of that
 
03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
I was an advocate for it and I still
 
03:57:51.149 --> 03:57:51.159 align:start position:0%
am at any rate after I was divorced I
 
03:57:53.590 --> 03:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
decided I would stay in school finish my
 
03:57:55.469 --> 03:57:55.479 align:start position:0%
degree and stay in the area and I was
 
03:57:57.429 --> 03:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to get two
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
jobs with a one with a defense
 
03:58:03.950 --> 03:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
contractor but it was a a temporary job
 
03:58:07.429 --> 03:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
no payment no pension plan no promotion
 
03:58:11.469 --> 03:58:11.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for me you get the picture here
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
I wasn't able to acrew wealth the way
 
03:58:16.630 --> 03:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
most most people are who stay in a
 
03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
career field or who stay in one place
 
03:58:22.510 --> 03:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
long for a period of
 
03:58:25.590 --> 03:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
time at the time I was uh working for
 
03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
the contractor I met Kevin my husband
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I became once again a military
 
03:58:32.590 --> 03:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
spouse I moved to a temporary assignment
 
03:58:35.070 --> 03:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
with no job available and then we were
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
stationed on okoa Japan I found a great
 
03:58:40.750 --> 03:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
mentor I was hired as a contractor to
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
help other military spouses overcome the
 
03:58:45.790 --> 03:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
same relocation issu isues I was having
 
03:58:48.910 --> 03:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
but no pension no retirement pain and no
 
03:58:51.670 --> 03:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
chance for a promotion eventually my
 
03:58:53.630 --> 03:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
mentor transferred back to the States
 
03:58:55.830 --> 03:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
and I was able to get her job which was
 
03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
a temporary civil service position it
 
03:59:02.229 --> 03:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
was my job to help military spouses find
 
03:59:04.750 --> 03:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
employment I had clients from all walks
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
of life and their their military spouses
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
were everything from Junior enlisted to
 
03:59:12.630 --> 03:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
senior officers but one day I had a
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
client in my office and I will never
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
forget she came into my office trying to
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
figure out how to apply for a job in her
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
chosen career field see she was a
 
03:59:27.309 --> 03:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
dentist she' left a promising valuable
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
career a practice in Southern California
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
with the idea that she'd be able to get
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:40.030 --> 03:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
okola Military dentists have those jobs
 
03:59:41.950 --> 03:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
she didn't speak Japanese she wasn't
 
03:59:44.910 --> 03:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
going to become a Japanese dentist
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
she sat in my office and as I had to
 
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
explain the reality to her that her
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
chances of being a dentist were
 
03:59:50.399 --> 03:59:51.469 align:start position:0%
chances of being a dentist were
effectively

03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
03:59:54.269 --> 03:59:54.279 align:start position:0%
nil she was angry she was confused she
 
03:59:55.950 --> 03:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
was afraid she didn't know what she was
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:59:59.870 --> 03:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
do that's not just one
 
04:00:02.670 --> 04:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
instance I was a career counselor for
 
04:00:05.070 --> 04:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
military spouses both on okano and then
 
04:00:07.590 --> 04:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
back again in Germany I saw literally
 
04:00:09.870 --> 04:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of spouses in that same kind of
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
position where their same career field
 
04:00:16.149 --> 04:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
it was heartbreaking to talk to that
 
04:00:20.269 --> 04:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
woman I will never forget her face but
 
04:00:23.309 --> 04:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
again it was not Comm uncommon we give
 
04:00:25.750 --> 04:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
up a lot as military
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
spouses we
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
move we have to decide whether to move
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
with our spouses or to stay put and
 
04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
raise children or live alone without our
 
04:00:40.229 --> 04:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
spouses we deal with
 
04:00:42.750 --> 04:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
deployments we're very often either
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
unemployed or underemployed and again no
 
04:00:47.670 --> 04:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
chance to acrew wealth through a pension
 
04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
plan not for
 
04:00:53.950 --> 04:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
us we if we don't move with our military
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
spouse we live in a community where
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
maybe nobody understands what it's like
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
to be a military spouse and so we don't
 
04:01:01.469 --> 04:01:01.479 align:start position:0%
have that community that sense of
 
04:01:03.269 --> 04:01:03.279 align:start position:0%
support that is so
 
04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
important we struggle to find child care
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
just like civilians we sometimes put up
 
04:01:11.550 --> 04:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
with substandard housing now no spouse
 
04:01:13.149 --> 04:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
enters into a marriage thinking it's
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
going to end
 
04:01:16.630 --> 04:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
we all hope for the best when we say
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
those vows and Military spouses are no
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
different but it happens and when it
 
04:01:24.229 --> 04:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
does a military spouse should have the
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
ability to have a Judge review whether
 
04:01:28.469 --> 04:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
or not they're eligible to share in
 
04:01:30.750 --> 04:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
their members retirement pay just as the
 
04:01:33.950 --> 04:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
federal law allows it is a small price
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
for the sacrifices we make it is
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
fair this New Hampshire legislature has
 
04:01:41.830 --> 04:01:41.840 align:start position:0%

04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%

committee today for the first time in
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
quite a while um and to have the
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so relative to subject
 
04:04:00.429 --> 04:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
matter special education and Foster
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
parenting that have impacted my own life
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
um in my personal and uh for personal
 
04:04:07.870 --> 04:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
and professional reasons as a former
 
04:04:10.389 --> 04:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
foster parent and adoptive parent of
 
04:04:12.149 --> 04:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities who received
 
04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
special education services over the the
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
years and a result of my experience in
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
my former role uh at New Hampshire's
 
04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
DCF I recognize the value of committed
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
foster parents in educational
 
04:04:26.110 --> 04:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking for children in care who
 
04:04:28.030 --> 04:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
are without legal parents to fulfill
 
04:04:30.670 --> 04:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
that role I also recognize the need to
 
04:04:32.670 --> 04:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
have our special education laws written
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
in such a way that limits confusion and
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
makes intent clear it is likely for that
 
04:04:40.349 --> 04:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
reason that a constituent with a great
 
04:04:42.149 --> 04:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
deal of experience and expertise in the
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
special education Arena requested that I
 
04:04:47.229 --> 04:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
file this bill relative to clarifying
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
confusing language in New Hampshire
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
special ed statute RSA chap 186 c
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
section 14a paragraph 1 um she is here
 
04:04:58.590 --> 04:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
actually and will also testify I've
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
provided copies of the current statute
 
04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
with the confusing language that this
 
04:05:05.349 --> 04:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to remove highlighted and
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
italicized in blue though your copies
 
04:05:10.510 --> 04:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
say red as they were printed not color
 
04:05:11.910 --> 04:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that thank you appreciate
 
04:05:13.710 --> 04:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
it not in color it only had blue
 
04:05:16.990 --> 04:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
highlighter so apologies just further
 
04:05:21.309 --> 04:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
confuse that this bill um though HB 178
 
04:05:24.269 --> 04:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
addresses statute um relative to the
 
04:05:25.870 --> 04:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
appointment of foster parents to make
 
04:05:28.269 --> 04:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
educational decisions on behalf of uh
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
children in their placement it changes
 
04:05:33.189 --> 04:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
nothing substantive about the policy it
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
merely removes confusing redundant
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
language to better clarify the statutes
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
meaning as you can see the line that's
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
crossed out that he or she has the
 
04:05:45.630 --> 04:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
Knowledge and Skills to represent the
 
04:05:47.550 --> 04:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
child adequately in
 
04:05:50.469 --> 04:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
Services appears in the in introductory
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
sentence of the statute that same phrase
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
is included in subsection 4 as written
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
the introductory sentence is confusing
 
04:06:00.750 --> 04:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
and given it also appears later within
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
the same section is redundant and
 
04:06:06.910 --> 04:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary HB 178 simply seeks to just
 
04:06:09.269 --> 04:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
remove those 16 words so that the
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
statute is more clear I ask that you
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
support an OT Mo OTP motion on hb178
 
04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and attention I
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
am so glad that you said what you just
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
did both the red par isn't you know that
 
04:06:24.429 --> 04:06:24.439 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate that but also I was so
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
afraid that you would say you can
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
represent the child even if you don't
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
have the skills to do it and that didn't
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
sound very nice right but what you're
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
saying is right there in front of me in
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
plain sight in bold letters the language
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
is still there we're still looking for
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
people who are capable to do it you're
 
04:06:47.149 --> 04:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
just removing a redundancy exactly
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
changes nothing about the statute see
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to ask you a question so
 
04:06:52.110 --> 04:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I would believe
 
04:06:58.710 --> 04:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you so much
 
04:07:10.590 --> 04:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.110 --> 04:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
Dunham you have 20 handouts are one hand
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
times thank you I'm Bonnie Dunham I live
 
04:07:34.030 --> 04:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
in miramac New Hampshire and um I'm glad
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
to be able to be here today I've been an
 
04:07:38.910 --> 04:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
educational surrogate parent for two
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
children um and I also conducted the
 
04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
training for about 10 years for
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
parents who wanted to become educational
 
04:07:47.469 --> 04:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
surrogate parents I always say
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
educational surrogate parent because the
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
the first time I was appointed to a
 
04:07:54.030 --> 04:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
child I went and met the people he was
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
living with and I said I'm the surrogate
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
parent and I know they were wondering
 
04:07:59.389 --> 04:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
what role I played in his coming into
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
this world and so I always say that
 
04:08:03.870 --> 04:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
first I kind of wish it said that anyway
 
04:08:06.910 --> 04:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't um in the special
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
education process parents play an
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
essential role they're members of the
 
04:08:13.469 --> 04:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
child's individualized education program
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
team or IEP team and they make decisions
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
at every step in that process but some
 
04:08:20.109 --> 04:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
children don't have someone to do that
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
for them not because the parents are
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
busy it's only when a parent is unknown
 
04:08:27.309 --> 04:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
is can't be located or the child is in
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
the custody of dcyf in that case so that
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
the child does still have someone
 
04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
representing them in the parent role
 
04:08:36.510 --> 04:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
whose only role is to look out for that
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
child as if they were the parent um in
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
that process the state is required to
 
04:08:43.030 --> 04:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
appoint a surrogate parent for that
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
child and in fact RSA 186c colon 14
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
establishes that process for training
 
04:08:51.269 --> 04:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
and appointing a surrogate parent to
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
represent that child when that child has
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
a foster parent though and the foster
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
parent would like to be able to
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
represent the child and advocate for
 
04:09:02.429 --> 04:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
them in the special education process
 
04:09:06.990 --> 04:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 186c colon 14-a provides a
 
04:09:09.229 --> 04:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
simplified streamlined process for that
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
to happen um they don't necessarily have
 
04:09:14.189 --> 04:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
to go through the N9 9 hour of training
 
04:09:15.710 --> 04:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
they just need to be able to demonstrate
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
that they know enough they need to be
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
they need to pass the test that somebody
 
04:09:21.870 --> 04:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
would pass after taking that so they can
 
04:09:23.469 --> 04:09:23.479 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they can appropriately
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
represent that child was part of the the
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
group that that talked about that when
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
the federal law was changed under the
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
federal law a foster parent a state can
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
decide a foster parent is just a parent
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
in that process we knew several times
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
though when a when a child was with a
 
04:09:41.109 --> 04:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
foster parent who wanted to represent
 
04:09:44.109 --> 04:09:44.119 align:start position:0%
them and 3 months later said I can't
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
handle this child and gave them up to
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
another foster parent the child lost
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
their surrogate parent and their foster
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
parent and was left in limbo until
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
someone new was hired and so that's why
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements is that they
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
have to have a long-term relationship
 
04:10:00.269 --> 04:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
with the child of at least one year so
 
04:10:01.510 --> 04:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know that they they know what
 
04:10:03.109 --> 04:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
they're in for and they're committed to
 
04:10:06.309 --> 04:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
that um the idea of having a simplified
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
process is fantastic but having language
 
04:10:11.149 --> 04:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
in that first sentence that is
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
discombobulated and confusing kind of
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
undoes the simplification of that
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
process instead of just reading a foster
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
parent or parents may be appointed by
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
Education or someone else right in the
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
middle of that it says a foster parent
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
may be appointed by the commissioner of
 
04:10:28.189 --> 04:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education that he or
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
she has the knowledge to represent the
 
04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
child adequately in services or
 
04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
designate so C somebody cut and pasted
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
it in there by mistake it's just fixing
 
04:10:40.030 --> 04:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
an error and this sentence fixes that
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
and the requirement that they have
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
Knowledge and Skills still exists okay
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
any questions in the interest of
 
04:10:50.510 --> 04:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
combobulation yes I was talking to my
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee this will look familiar in
 
04:14:16.910 --> 04:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
fact all three of them that I'm going to
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
be presenting today going to look
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
familiar uh this bill is exactly as it
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
passed this committee last term exactly
 
04:14:26.830 --> 04:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
as it passed the Senate after passing
 
04:14:29.349 --> 04:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
the house floor uh the Senate made a
 
04:14:31.229 --> 04:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
minor amendment I kept that amendment in
 
04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
here to match what the Senate wanted the
 
04:14:35.149 --> 04:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
only problem with it was we couldn't
 
04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
come to a uh an agreement when it came
 
04:14:39.550 --> 04:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
back to the house because it was
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
apparently co-mingled with some other
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
things that we had to concur with
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
and uh it got non-c
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
concurred but this is the bill that
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
addresses a situation that uh I
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
experienced personally where uh we
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
identified and and it was confirmed uh
 
04:14:59.950 --> 04:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
in the Senate when uh the chairman the
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
chairwoman of the committee over there
 
04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh asked for more information from the
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
department and uh gave them a week to
 
04:15:09.149 --> 04:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
come up with proof that it didn't happen
 
04:15:10.830 --> 04:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
and they were not able to provide such
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
proof and she made her Amendment and
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
passed it out of the Senate this the
 
04:15:19.630 --> 04:15:19.640 align:start position:0%
situation at hand is that uh the uh
 
04:15:22.590 --> 04:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
um Child Support
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
Services expects the payment every week
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
and some of us are paid every two weeks
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
so every now and then in the middle of
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
the year it looks like we're short by
 
04:15:35.040 --> 04:15:36.269 align:start position:0%
the year it looks like we're short by
about

04:15:36.269 --> 04:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
$5 and I went to go uh with a new job
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
get a passport renewed sent my passport
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
off and my wages are garnished so my I
 
04:15:49.750 --> 04:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
had no way I could fall behind um and uh
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
I was notified by the state department
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
down in Washington that they were not
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
going to renew my passport because I was
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
behind on my child support I said well
 
04:16:00.109 --> 04:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
how could that be and when I called they
 
04:16:01.790 --> 04:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
said oh yeah you're off by I think it
 
04:16:03.990 --> 04:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
was like $6 and change something like
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
that um I actually had given last term
 
04:16:10.670 --> 04:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
the the figures and proof copy to the uh
 
04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
chairman so he could actually see the
 
04:16:13.950 --> 04:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
veracity of the
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
misalignment um and uh I had to pay that
 
04:16:22.189 --> 04:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
$6 and change wait a few days and then
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
ask the state department to please query
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
the state again to see if I had was up
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
to date so that I could get my passport
 
04:16:30.309 --> 04:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
and if I waited too long it could have
 
04:16:31.830 --> 04:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
gone through another pay cycle and I
 
04:16:34.229 --> 04:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
might have been off again so what we're
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do uh is fix that problem by
 
04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
ensuring that one the dollar amount is
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
actually reported because when I was in
 
04:16:46.710 --> 04:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
discussion with the uh state department
 
04:16:49.229 --> 04:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
they said we don't know what the amount
 
04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
is that you're in a rear we just get
 
04:16:53.309 --> 04:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
told that either red light green light
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
when we ask them if you're behind or on
 
04:16:58.950 --> 04:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
time and um we never get reported the
 
04:17:00.510 --> 04:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
amount so we couldn't say oh that's just
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
a rounding error or that's a problem you
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
know not really a delinquency we'll go
 
04:17:06.910 --> 04:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
ahead and process it so we're asking
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
that with this bill that the agency if
 
04:17:10.830 --> 04:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
they report to the federal government a
 
04:17:12.510 --> 04:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
delinquency does report the dollar
 
04:17:15.149 --> 04:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
amount and that they do not report
 
04:17:17.349 --> 04:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
delinquencies unless they actually meet
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
the federal threshold that they say that
 
04:17:21.550 --> 04:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
they are meet they are not reporting
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
unless they meet um I know currently
 
04:17:26.349 --> 04:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
that they're going to come up and
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
testify that they do not report these
 
04:17:30.149 --> 04:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
unless they hit a certain threshold and
 
04:17:33.670 --> 04:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's pretty high but it happened to me
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
so I know that somehow it gets reported
 
04:17:38.670 --> 04:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
and it happens so I want to make sure
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
that we hold them to the threshold that
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
they say they meet already by put
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
putting it in the statute and I want to
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that we also make them report
 
04:17:48.510 --> 04:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount so that if the
 
04:17:51.109 --> 04:17:51.119 align:start position:0%
situation pops up that it's $5 short the
 
04:17:52.590 --> 04:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
state department down in the federal
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
government doesn't say oh this person's
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
delinquent they can say oh that's a
 
04:17:56.840 --> 04:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
delinquent they can say oh that's a
rounding

04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
rounding
 
04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
error and Mr chairman I seem to remember
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
when we did this dance once before you
 
04:18:06.030 --> 04:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
were pointing out to me others for whom
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
this had happened in other words you're
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
not some poor individual solo sucker
 
04:18:14.189 --> 04:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
correct there was a question as to
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
whether this only happened for me but
 
04:18:19.469 --> 04:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
your committee researcher actually got
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
that data for your your committee and I
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
do not remember what the numbers were
 
04:18:25.630 --> 04:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure she could make that
 
04:18:27.070 --> 04:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
available again to the committee I'm
 
04:18:28.950 --> 04:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
sure she'd love
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
to to to show you that it happens
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
approximately I don't know a 100 or so
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
times to citizens of New Hampshire every
 
04:18:40.349 --> 04:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
year so any
 
04:18:42.990 --> 04:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
for being here and sharing your story
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
again so I I'm going to have one
 
04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
question and then followup so get ready
 
04:18:54.910 --> 04:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
for my followup okay just go like this a
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
followup okay whenever you uh came
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
before us last time and shared your
 
04:19:01.630 --> 04:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
story it was you said 4 cents so what is
 
04:19:04.830 --> 04:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
the amount that you were it it was the
 
04:19:08.189 --> 04:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
four the 4 cents was a um it could be as
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
low as 4 cents is what I had said
 
04:19:11.309 --> 04:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
because it can be actually as low as
 
04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
just a couple of pennies if if the G if
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's a red light not a green light
 
04:19:18.990 --> 04:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
saying the person is not o paid over
 
04:19:22.269 --> 04:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
their current uh due amount or paid at
 
04:19:24.429 --> 04:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
that level if it's behind by as little
 
04:19:27.389 --> 04:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
as 4 cents it gets a red light and and
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
gets denied my case I think I don't
 
04:19:32.070 --> 04:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
remember what the amount was we had the
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork all in front of you U Mr
 
04:19:36.189 --> 04:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
chairman last time but it was $6 and
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
change or so something to that effect
 
04:19:40.750 --> 04:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
followup there's my followup or my crazy
 
04:19:44.109 --> 04:19:44.119 align:start position:0%
sign um thank you for uh letting me
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
follow up so I also have a question
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
because I I remembered your thing we
 
04:19:52.510 --> 04:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
talked outside of this about this and so
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
I went and asked a ton of people about
 
04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
that I know that have have had their
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
issue you know that have um been paying
 
04:20:00.429 --> 04:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
child support have they ever lost their
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
passport um I found one person he was
 
04:20:05.630 --> 04:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
2600 which he met the federal threshold
 
04:20:08.349 --> 04:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
of 2500 I couldn't find anybody that was
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
close to you as a matter of fact
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
whenever they got below 2500 they were
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
ready to do that so I know that you've
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
said you provided it for Pearson but is
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
there some way that you can provide us
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
documentation showing that that happened
 
04:20:22.030 --> 04:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
like you could take out your particulars
 
04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
but showing that it's like $6 because
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
you said you don't know the amount but
 
04:20:27.469 --> 04:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
it was $6 but can you show us if I go
 
04:20:30.109 --> 04:20:30.119 align:start position:0%
dig it up again I can probably find that
 
04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
and provide it um that would be helpful
 
04:20:34.830 --> 04:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
because you're the only one I can find
 
04:20:36.309 --> 04:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
um well I I can tell you that the
 
04:20:38.070 --> 04:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
numbers that were brought up by your
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
committee researchers showed that it
 
04:20:41.109 --> 04:20:41.119 align:start position:0%
happens to a lot of people for very low
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
amounts uh every single Year and that
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
was actual State data that she was able
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
to find in a day it wasn't very didn't
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
take very long um so it does happen it
 
04:20:55.229 --> 04:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
does happen to a lot of people and um
 
04:20:57.750 --> 04:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's not the other issue with that
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
threshold is it doesn't automatically
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
clear me again if it goes below the
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
threshold you have to actually
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
proactively call and tell them you're
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
now Bel below it so where I was
 
04:21:14.590 --> 04:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
garnished I wouldn't have even known
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
that I was reported until I went to
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
renew my passport there is no proactive
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism within the department to say
 
04:21:24.429 --> 04:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
to me we've reported you for
 
04:21:27.309 --> 04:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
delinquency nor is there one to clear me
 
04:21:31.550 --> 04:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
if I'm no longer delinquent so falling
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
behind and and the way it lines up I get
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
paid every two weeks at the beginning of
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
the year I'm dead even by the middle of
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
the Year nothing lines up and I'm always
 
04:21:43.389 --> 04:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
delinquent a certain amount by the end
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the year it catches right up again
 
04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:48.119 align:start position:0%
and it's 100% lined up well by the end
 
04:21:49.710 --> 04:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
of the year it lines up again I'm no
 
04:21:51.070 --> 04:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
longer delinquent but they're not going
 
04:21:53.309 --> 04:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
to clear me so that could carry on for
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
years until I proactively call them and
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
say hey would you double check and and
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
clear me from the delinquency because
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
anymore representative rice thank you Mr
 
04:22:08.269 --> 04:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
question so you were never you had never
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
reached the threath threshold of a rear
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
ages of $2500 correct because I was
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
garnished and my pay never hit that um
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
it was always taken out but it was I
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand it until I started
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
lining up how much were they expecting
 
04:22:27.870 --> 04:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
each week with how much was getting sent
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
by my company every two weeks and
 
04:22:31.950 --> 04:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
realizing that it it was going down but
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
it was never more than um 20 some odd
 
04:22:36.189 --> 04:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
dollars in the very middle of the year
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
that it misaligned by and at the time
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
that I asked for the passport I think it
 
04:22:42.510 --> 04:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
was $6 and change that I had to pay them
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
over the phone um so that I could become
 
04:22:48.269 --> 04:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
zero so that I could then call the state
 
04:22:49.950 --> 04:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
department in Washington and have them
 
04:22:52.109 --> 04:22:52.119 align:start position:0%
issue the passport so I could go to my
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
new job in Canada um and visit the
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
office and run for yes followup okay
 
04:23:02.990 --> 04:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rice a
 
04:23:07.630 --> 04:23:07.640 align:start position:0%

04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr chairman good
 
04:23:34.149 --> 04:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon um so it's at the outset I'm
 
04:23:36.149 --> 04:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
aware that this bill's been was coming
 
04:23:38.189 --> 04:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
through this committee last year and
 
04:23:40.269 --> 04:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
just want to state that the bureau is
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill um I did not put
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
that I had much I figured there's going
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
to be questions so I wasn't going to say
 
04:23:49.870 --> 04:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
that much again we're neutral on the
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
bill we feel like we're already
 
04:23:54.750 --> 04:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
complying with it and if the
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
legislature feels it's appropriate to
 
04:24:00.189 --> 04:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation uh we have no
 
04:24:03.149 --> 04:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
opposition in other words it might not
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
help arguably but it won't
 
04:24:09.630 --> 04:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
hurt uh I don't see how it could hurt I
 
04:24:11.950 --> 04:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
like I said I I think that the program
 
04:24:14.030 --> 04:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
is already
 
04:24:16.590 --> 04:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
reporting in compliance with federal
 
04:24:19.269 --> 04:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
guidelines um the system is set up in a
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
way where it
 
04:24:21.520 --> 04:24:23.590 align:start position:0%
way where it
reports

04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
reports
 
04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
the arear to the federal child support
 
04:24:28.990 --> 04:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
agency when they reach a certain
 
04:24:30.990 --> 04:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
threshold like I we've all spoken about
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
many times so in this case 2500 when it
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
gets to that point that gets reported to
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
the federal agency uh child sport agency
 
04:24:42.670 --> 04:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
and then I realize this is speculative
 
04:24:44.590 --> 04:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
but how might you account for chairman
 
04:24:47.149 --> 04:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
Spain's problem and that of maybe a
 
04:24:50.670 --> 04:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
hundred other people I I I can't really
 
04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
speak to anyone's specific case I'm not
 
04:24:55.469 --> 04:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
even allowed to due to confidentiality I
 
04:25:00.910 --> 04:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't know um why that if if that I I
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
really can't speak I don't know they
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't know about it sorry oh then
 
04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
let's move to a hypothetical of a
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
citizen of undetermined name were
 
04:25:12.910 --> 04:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
reported for 50
 
04:25:15.630 --> 04:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
and yet the threshold is 2500 how might
 
04:25:18.750 --> 04:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
that be occurring I I don't know I mean
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's a it's electronically transmitted
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't I think there's no person
 
04:25:28.510 --> 04:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's doing it so um it gets you know
 
04:25:29.950 --> 04:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
the balances get electronically
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
transferred to the federal child support
 
04:25:32.040 --> 04:25:34.109 align:start position:0%
transferred to the federal child support
agency

04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:25:37.469 --> 04:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
and they send it along to the applicable
 
04:25:39.149 --> 04:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
federal agency in this case would be the
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
Department of State and um they would
 
04:25:46.229 --> 04:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
put the hold on the passport um and then
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
it would be continuously the balances
 
04:25:51.070 --> 04:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
would be reported every month I believe
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
every month to the federal agency and if
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
it reached
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
zero um then it would drop off or if
 
04:26:03.229 --> 04:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to reach out to the case
 
04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
officer and ask about it um maybe some
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
other sort of arrangement can be made
 
04:26:10.030 --> 04:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
with the state agency okay so it's more
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
of a caseby casee basis representative
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:26:19.830 --> 04:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you made a
 
04:26:23.109 --> 04:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
statement that said that when the aages
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
reach zero it just drops off does that
 
04:26:32.510 --> 04:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
mean that your agency does not
 
04:26:35.790 --> 04:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
specifically report to the federal
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
government that the aages are now in a
 
04:26:42.550 --> 04:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
zero status
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question and that's
 
04:26:46.950 --> 04:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
a really good question um and you have
 
04:26:49.990 --> 04:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
to understand I'm not really an expert
 
04:26:53.710 --> 04:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
on the technology piece of it but it's
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding um that yeah the
 
04:27:00.030 --> 04:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
balance it's I think of it in my head as
 
04:27:01.790 --> 04:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
almost like it's coded in a certain way
 
04:27:03.870 --> 04:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
so if it's zero if the rears are zero
 
04:27:06.510 --> 04:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
then it should go to the federal child
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
sport agency as zero and then they
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
should take it off that's my
 
04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
understanding of the program the
 
04:27:14.189 --> 04:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
information that we've submitted to this
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past is stated if it's
 
04:27:19.389 --> 04:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
zero the passport should be
 
04:27:19.399 --> 04:27:20.910 align:start position:0%
zero the passport should be
returned

04:27:20.910 --> 04:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
returned
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
um but if it's not zero then then then
 
04:27:26.070 --> 04:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah if it it could theoretically be a
 
04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
small balance that's causing it to stay
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
revoked and I think that's what you were
 
04:27:35.309 --> 04:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
probably getting at perhaps yeah follow
 
04:27:38.590 --> 04:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
taking my followup I just want to make
 
04:27:46.750 --> 04:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
this clear clear in my head thank you um
 
04:27:51.710 --> 04:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
so you're not sure if the
 
04:27:55.870 --> 04:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
specific um data entry is made to notify
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
government that it has reached a zero
 
04:28:03.189 --> 04:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
status is that correct no I think that
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
they were told it's zero if it is zero
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
when it gets reported I just don't know
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
exactly it wise
 
04:28:12.550 --> 04:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
like like how the computer tells the
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
other computer if you will uh like how
 
04:28:17.109 --> 04:28:17.119 align:start position:0%
that exactly looks but the balances
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
would show zero and that should trigger
 
04:28:21.389 --> 04:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
the federal agency
 
04:28:24.670 --> 04:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
to Res restore the passport one more one
 
04:28:27.990 --> 04:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
more thank you so it could be as low as
 
04:28:31.469 --> 04:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
um what we heard testimony as 4 cents
 
04:28:37.149 --> 04:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
and the person would be denied a um a
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
passport because of 4 cents is that
 
04:28:43.109 --> 04:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
correct I'm not sure about 4 cents uh I
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
I will what I can say is that
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
confidently based on what how the
 
04:28:48.279 --> 04:28:49.510 align:start position:0%
confidently based on what how the
program

04:28:49.510 --> 04:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
works if it hypothetically went over
 
04:28:56.550 --> 04:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
2500 let's say and then it got
 
04:28:59.070 --> 04:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
revoked if it later on in the case
 
04:29:01.229 --> 04:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
history somebody was paying it down and
 
04:29:03.550 --> 04:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
they were doing a good job but it was
 
04:29:06.149 --> 04:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
let's say when it got reported it was
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
$200 balance it would stay the same
 
04:29:14.269 --> 04:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
until reached zero or if the state
 
04:29:18.429 --> 04:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
agency says uh codes it with a
 
04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
restoration like Flags it for saying no
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
we worked something out restore it and
 
04:29:27.070 --> 04:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
again I'm I'm trying to paraphrasing how
 
04:29:28.830 --> 04:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
computers would essentially it would be
 
04:29:30.510 --> 04:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
coded probably in a way that would make
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
them do that there's no person that
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
would call them and say anything does
 
04:29:36.830 --> 04:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
that make sense thank you you did a
 
04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
great job representative
 
04:29:41.229 --> 04:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
for being here in your test testimony
 
04:29:44.349 --> 04:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
there are a few things that just broke
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
my brain last year and this was one of
 
04:29:47.790 --> 04:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
them and looking at it and with the
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
amendment like I think it's fine and
 
04:29:52.389 --> 04:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
everything but my concern is if this is
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
happening certainly on a grander scale
 
04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
than one where the breakdown is because
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
this would technically have to break in
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
two Tech spaces right first your
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
reporting and then the federal
 
04:30:07.790 --> 04:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
also because it goes through it's almost
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
like two steps to do this correct thank
 
04:30:12.870 --> 04:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I hadn't thought
 
04:30:15.030 --> 04:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
of it that way personally but that's a
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
good point um you the systems would in
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
theory in theory be talking to each
 
04:30:22.349 --> 04:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
other and it would I'm not sure how it
 
04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
would look on their end if I mean they
 
04:30:26.429 --> 04:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
would be given like I said they would be
 
04:30:29.070 --> 04:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
given a balance they wouldn't be given a
 
04:30:30.750 --> 04:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
balance unless it met the threshold and
 
04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
once they were in the threshold so they
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they shouldn't see something
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't see in a case
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
that never met that threshold I don't I
 
04:30:45.630 --> 04:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
don't know why that would happen like I
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
said it's at some point it becomes an it
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
question I'm not really sure but that's
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
not how the system should
 
04:30:55.149 --> 04:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
work representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and um thank you attorney Hayes
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so my question is
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
about that threshold right so is the
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
child support agency the state reporting
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
every month everybody who's in AAR to
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
the federal or are they only reporting
 
04:31:13.950 --> 04:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
the ones that start that hit that $2,500
 
04:31:17.469 --> 04:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
threshold and then I I have a followup
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
after that if what whichever the answer
 
04:31:22.750 --> 04:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
is okay let him answer then waave at me
 
04:31:24.750 --> 04:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for the
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
question um that's also a really good
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
question they it has they have to meet
 
04:31:33.269 --> 04:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
the threshold first okay um and
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
that not to make it more confusing but
 
04:31:38.189 --> 04:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
there is other
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
thresholds um and the most the other
 
04:31:43.349 --> 04:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
common one is the TA intercept that
 
04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
one's a little bit lower so that one was
 
04:31:48.670 --> 04:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
$500 so it it would
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
be it it' be it could be different
 
04:31:52.750 --> 04:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
thresholds but let's maybe just for
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
Simplicity stick with it what we've been
 
04:31:56.469 --> 04:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
talking about yeah it they wouldn't know
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
about it unless it meant to threshold
 
04:32:01.710 --> 04:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
okay so for thank you Mr chairman so for
 
04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
04:32:05.710 --> 04:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
consistently behind by a couple hundred
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
dollars because we know sometimes this
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
happens you carry a balance you're
 
04:32:10.349 --> 04:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
trying to get it down are they
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
consistently being reported again and
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
again or only if let me rephrase it if
 
04:32:21.710 --> 04:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
they if they hit the 2500 right but they
 
04:32:24.750 --> 04:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
pay it down so that it's less than 2500
 
04:32:28.990 --> 04:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
are they still reported or does that
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
stop I believe they should they're still
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
being reported okay until it gets to
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
zero yeah okay thank you representative
 
04:32:40.710 --> 04:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
rice thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:32:42.910 --> 04:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:32:46.910 --> 04:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
so do does the division now not notify
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.670 --> 04:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
aage and and thank you for the question
 
04:32:57.550 --> 04:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
um they get the notification for the
 
04:33:00.030 --> 04:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
offset program would would come from
 
04:33:01.750 --> 04:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
what I believe I believe it's from the
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
federal child support agency they should
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
get something from the federal child
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
support agency saying that they're
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
they're in the offset program now and it
 
04:33:11.400 --> 04:33:13.949 align:start position:0%
they're in the offset program now and it
discuss

04:33:13.949 --> 04:33:13.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.959 --> 04:33:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:33:18.429 --> 04:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
references the child support program uh
 
04:33:20.670 --> 04:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
that that notice I haven't seen it but I
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
know that they get something from the
 
04:33:24.189 --> 04:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
federal child support program telling
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
them what the program is that they're
 
04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
been flagged for followup thank you Mr
 
04:33:29.439 --> 04:33:31.109 align:start position:0%
been flagged for followup thank you Mr
chairman

04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:33:34.990 --> 04:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
so is that only if they reach the
 
04:33:39.150 --> 04:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
2500 or if they hit 200 in aages they're
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
getting a notice so they know I I think
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's only if they meet the threshold in
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
either the tax one or this one and or or
 
04:33:52.029 --> 04:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
so they only get that notice from the
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
federal child boort agency one more
 
04:33:56.789 --> 04:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
quick sure so I know that there's an
 
04:33:58.709 --> 04:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
automated telephone line that you can
 
04:34:01.709 --> 04:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
call here in the state right to find out
 
04:34:03.869 --> 04:34:03.879 align:start position:0%
how much you get how much is owed how
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
much is in a rares I know for for me the
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
person who's supposed to be paid right
 
04:34:13.629 --> 04:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
does the person that pays are are those
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
same um I don't know options available
 
04:34:19.709 --> 04:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
like if they called would it tell them
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
how much they owed if they were in AAR
 
04:34:25.349 --> 04:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
because I know for me calling it tells
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
me how much I'm owed in aares does it
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to see these people
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
set up to fail I mean we shouldn't be
 
04:34:35.470 --> 04:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
waiting till
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
$2,500 to tell them they're in
 
04:34:40.590 --> 04:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
AAR you know what I mean like I feel
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
like that's just setting them up for
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
failure I agree and I I'd have to check
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
in on that and I know that there's
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
notices that they would get from us as
 
04:34:54.189 --> 04:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
an agency before that about I know
 
04:34:55.629 --> 04:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
there's a notice of debt that goes out
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
early on the case as well but I'd have
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
to I'm not sure about that specific
 
04:35:04.590 --> 04:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
question if I could get back to you that
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
that'd be okay okay great thank you so
 
04:35:12.269 --> 04:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
much I try to type a
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
notice an email to the group and there
 
04:35:19.150 --> 04:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
is a group email CFL such and
 
04:35:23.070 --> 04:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
such I can't successfully do it on my
 
04:35:26.910 --> 04:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
email account it always kicks out and
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
the IT department in the state has
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
worked on this for several years and
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
they their conclusion is there's got to
 
04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
be a glitch here
 
04:35:37.709 --> 04:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere to which I
 
04:35:40.470 --> 04:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
agree which leads into the question of
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
could it be quite possible I that with
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
certain people in the state there is a
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
glitch here that is causing something to
 
04:35:49.390 --> 04:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
happen that shouldn't happen not because
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
anybody's being bad but a glitch is
 
04:35:54.750 --> 04:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
happening that was a question I I don't
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
know representative I and thank you for
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
the question um you I like I said I'm I
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
only know how the program works and uh
 
04:36:06.070 --> 04:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's generally what I would tell people
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
is you know it I I didn't design it so I
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
really can't get into the if there's a
 
04:36:14.189 --> 04:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
coding I don't know what kind of issue
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
there could be but um
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
certainly I can't get any more specific
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
from that but it is your testimony that
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
were this to pass it wouldn't hurt
 
04:36:28.990 --> 04:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
things yeah I would say that's the
 
04:36:31.510 --> 04:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
position that I took when I started it's
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
I right neutral oh sorry that was not
 
04:36:33.760 --> 04:36:34.551 align:start position:0%
I right neutral oh sorry that was not
for

04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:36:37.109 --> 04:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
you that was me making a point to me
 
04:36:41.070 --> 04:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
okay sorry yes representative price
 
04:36:43.390 --> 04:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so passing this
 
04:36:45.429 --> 04:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily going to fix the whole
 
04:36:48.910 --> 04:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
glitch thing is do you know what I'm
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
saying like how how would passing this
 
04:36:57.150 --> 04:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
system I me do we have to make a bill to
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
say to the Department of um child
 
04:37:04.510 --> 04:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
support you need to investigate this if
 
04:37:07.590 --> 04:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
this keeps happening we do I can't I'm
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
not sure if I can answer that I I don't
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
think there's a glitch I'm not not aware
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
of a glitch um but this man has glitch I
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
can't speak to anybody's particular case
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
I know that if someone brought something
 
04:37:22.150 --> 04:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
to our attention we could certainly
 
04:37:24.990 --> 04:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
speak with them on a caseby Case
 
04:37:30.349 --> 04:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
basis thank you well folks what do you
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
think I mean I'm almost ready to quote a
 
04:37:35.629 --> 04:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
famous politician that says maybe we
 
04:37:37.629 --> 04:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
just ought to pass this and see what
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
happens somebody said that and maybe if
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
this problem goes away this was
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
successful and if it didn't it didn't
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
make it worse I mean you want to execute
 
04:37:50.070 --> 04:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
are we ready to execute do you
 
04:37:50.080 --> 04:37:51.869 align:start position:0%
are we ready to execute do you
think

04:37:51.869 --> 04:37:51.879 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:37:55.390 --> 04:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
no thank you very much um I just was a
 
04:37:58.150 --> 04:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
question if they notice the
 
04:38:02.109 --> 04:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
parent like there is a notice like a
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
$60 this would be a question to the like
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
it was just for for $60 he knows that
 
04:38:12.990 --> 04:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
like he could not pay no he he owes
 
04:38:15.869 --> 04:38:15.879 align:start position:0%
there was a notice for him to know he
 
04:38:15.879 --> 04:38:20.629 align:start position:0%
there was a notice for him to know he
owes

04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
$6 uh do the child send out notices for
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
Rees right yeah there's there's we sent
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
out notices um they wouldn't necessarily
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
he might not he wouldn't someone
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
somebody wouldn't necessarily get
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
multiple notices from the federal state
 
04:38:40.750 --> 04:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
agent the federal agency that is dealing
 
04:38:42.910 --> 04:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
with Thresh old and the whole subject we
 
04:38:44.310 --> 04:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
were just talking about they wouldn't
 
04:38:47.789 --> 04:38:47.799 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get multiple notices from
 
04:38:49.629 --> 04:38:49.639 align:start position:0%
the federal government every month once
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
they've hit that threshold they get the
 
04:38:53.390 --> 04:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
notice and then they're on
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
notice uh we are both straying a bit
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
from the bill itself and also repeating
 
04:39:02.830 --> 04:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves uh one more and then uh we're
 
04:39:06.150 --> 04:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
going to decide whether we exec or not
 
04:39:06.160 --> 04:39:07.670 align:start position:0%
going to decide whether we exec or not
representative

04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
um rice thank you Mr follow by the other
 
04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
one more Coen Coen so are you saying
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
that all delinquent notices come from
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
the federal government and not the state
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm asking if the state is
 
04:39:23.470 --> 04:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
sending out notices not the federal
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
government I want to know if he was sent
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
a notice that said he owed
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
$6 before he was surprised by the
 
04:39:30.600 --> 04:39:33.510 align:start position:0%
$6 before he was surprised by the
federal

04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.150 --> 04:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
government I feel like we're I I'm
 
04:39:38.670 --> 04:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
trying to be I don't want to com I don't
 
04:39:39.990 --> 04:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
want to comment on anybody's case I
 
04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
really don't know about his case what
 
04:39:43.470 --> 04:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
may he may or may not have received just
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
try to speak generally when somebody
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
meets this threshold they get a notice
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
from the federal government because
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
those programs are federal programs
 
04:39:54.190 --> 04:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
there are other notices that people do
 
04:39:55.948 --> 04:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
get from our
 
04:39:55.958 --> 04:39:57.948 align:start position:0%
get from our
agency

04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
um but they come at different times and
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
different points in the case for
 
04:40:02.560 --> 04:40:03.430 align:start position:0%
different points in the case for
different

04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
reasons no last one go ahead thank you
 
04:40:08.910 --> 04:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for being here
 
04:40:11.550 --> 04:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
and answering my question um I think my
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
question is along the same lines as
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative rice so someone's delink
 
04:40:22.390 --> 04:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
going um and until they reach
 
04:40:24.788 --> 04:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
$2500 they're still just within the
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
state what
 
04:40:29.070 --> 04:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
happens to those people who are less
 
04:40:29.080 --> 04:40:33.230 align:start position:0%
happens to those people who are less
than

04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
$2500 uh well they went I get thank you
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
for the question I appreciate that and
 
04:40:39.868 --> 04:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an interesting question
 
04:40:42.150 --> 04:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
but basically there are other state
 
04:40:44.830 --> 04:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
remedies that we have and um we talked
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
about we can C I can send you more
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
information about those I mean there's
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
certainly other things that the bureau
 
04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
can do
 
04:40:56.190 --> 04:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
to enforce the cases just one follow but
 
04:40:59.230 --> 04:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
no um okay uh we we're kicking this
 
04:41:01.390 --> 04:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
around again and again I just would like
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
a show of thumbs are we ready to exec
 
04:41:08.670 --> 04:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
this or not if so thumbs up if
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
04:41:14.910 --> 04:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
I think we are okay good thank you and
 
04:41:16.948 --> 04:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you councelor you've been grilled
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and this ends the

and the chair recognizes representative
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I move are
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%

second thank you Mr chairman members of
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
the committee once again this is a bill
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
that you all passed through the
 
04:43:57.390 --> 04:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
committee and we passed through the
 
04:44:00.430 --> 04:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
house floor last term uh did not make it
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
through the senate for some reason uh
 
04:44:06.590 --> 04:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
this one simply is asking the courts
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
during the final decree period of a
 
04:44:11.390 --> 04:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
divorce when there is child support
 
04:44:13.750 --> 04:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
involved to notify the parties that
 
04:44:16.150 --> 04:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
there is currently a right under our law
 
04:44:18.030 --> 04:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
for them to not be garnished if they
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
both choose not to and that's all it
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
says it basically is because I'm I found
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
out that I had a right long after I was
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
told by the court oh no it's automatic
 
04:44:30.590 --> 04:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
garnishment just happens and it's the
 
04:44:32.670 --> 04:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
the way we do things and when I was
 
04:44:33.868 --> 04:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
looking through the
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
rsas after uh my ex asked me if I could
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
please prepay for my son's summer camp
 
04:44:42.590 --> 04:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I went to the state and said is
 
04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
there a way I can send you extra money
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
for a couple of months extra upfront so
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
that they could put a down payment on
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
the summer camp they said no we don't
 
04:44:51.150 --> 04:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
have a way to handle that if you send us
 
04:44:52.430 --> 04:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
two months extra we're going to end up
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
sending it back to you but it'll take a
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
while so you you're better off just to
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh give it to her and it won't count
 
04:45:01.070 --> 04:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
towards your child's support but just
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
give it to her and I said well how come
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
I can't prepay well you could have made
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
arrangements they told me to pay
 
04:45:09.788 --> 04:45:09.798 align:start position:0%
directly to each other and I neither one
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
of us knew that because were both
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
getting along quite fine with me just
 
04:45:17.230 --> 04:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
paying whenever I was due paying her um
 
04:45:18.990 --> 04:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
so we're we're asking here with this
 
04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill to to say to the judge in the
 
04:45:24.750 --> 04:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
courtroom that part of the instructions
 
04:45:27.628 --> 04:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
and the final disposition is let them
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
know they have a right if they both
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
agree to not be garnished there are some
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh situations where I've put in here
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
that they should not be allowed to do
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
that one if there's a protective order
 
04:45:38.910 --> 04:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
in place that should not happen one if
 
04:45:40.390 --> 04:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
the per one of the parties lives out of
 
04:45:43.708 --> 04:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
state that should not happen and uh one
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
if the person is already delinquent on
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
child support from someplace else that
 
04:45:48.750 --> 04:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
should not happen but in any other
 
04:45:50.708 --> 04:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
situation if both parties agree I think
 
04:45:51.788 --> 04:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
they should be told that they have a
 
04:45:53.708 --> 04:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
right to not be garnished and to avoid
 
04:45:53.718 --> 04:45:54.550 align:start position:0%
right to not be garnished and to avoid
that

04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
system and that's
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
it any questions for representative spay
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
and representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
04:46:05.670 --> 04:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative um
 
04:46:07.990 --> 04:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to recall our specifics and I
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
have something in my head about a form
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
being our hang up you guys developed a
 
04:46:15.750 --> 04:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
form in the committee we did you did did
 
04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
we create a form I like you designed one
 
04:46:21.708 --> 04:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
or or explained how it had to be done or
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
something that both parties would have
 
04:46:25.628 --> 04:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
that form at the final disposition and
 
04:46:26.948 --> 04:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
they could both sign into it and it
 
04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
would have instructions saying that you
 
04:46:30.910 --> 04:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
know if if you default then you can be
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
going into garnishment automatically I
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if I ever saw that form but I
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
know that the part the the committee
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
discussed it and
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
somebody came with a maybe it was you
 
04:46:45.750 --> 04:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
rep sidel I I I don't remember but
 
04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
somebody on the committee actually
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
contacted me and said we've made a form
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't so Mr chairman I could not I
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
pulled my stuff I had form written down
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
like 72 times and I found nothing else
 
04:47:01.470 --> 04:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
and then I was like why did I write down
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
form can't remember
 
04:47:07.070 --> 04:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah somebody got yeah because I
 
04:47:09.628 --> 04:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
think the only objection from the court
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
side of things was that they have any
 
04:47:13.070 --> 04:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a form for that right and it
 
04:47:15.990 --> 04:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
says the the court shall create the form
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I think the Judiciary was like we
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't create forms and I think we yeah
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
that was that was kind of it so yeah
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
keep going keep going yeah but I do
 
04:47:26.910 --> 04:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
remember the committee did something
 
04:47:29.190 --> 04:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
with a form I just don't remember what
 
04:47:29.200 --> 04:47:30.270 align:start position:0%
with a form I just don't remember what
it

04:47:30.270 --> 04:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:47:37.708 --> 04:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.548 --> 04:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:49.868 --> 04:47:49.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I assume you're done with my
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%

we're not I mean you don't have to be go
 
04:48:45.070 --> 04:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm concerned because we're
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
wanting the courts to uh create a new
 
04:48:50.270 --> 04:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
form this is what this would do that's
 
04:48:53.670 --> 04:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
going to have a fiscal note on it so I I
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't see anything for a fiscal note or
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
anything you can't just create a form
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
and not cost money unfortunately
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%

05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
before we get to the next bill I am
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
going to open a an exec session briefly
 
05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
on House Bill uh 213 is
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
it is that what we
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
doing and the purpose of the exec
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
session is not to EXA the bill per se
 
05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
but to
 
05:08:23.070 --> 05:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
request the the budget people to prepare
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note this is what we found them
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
saying to us to representative Greg's
 
05:08:31.830 --> 05:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
question about uh gee if we pass the
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill and doesn't have a fiscal note
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen so the motion
 
05:08:39.990 --> 05:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
before us is does this committee
 
05:08:44.548 --> 05:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
wish the budget office whatever it is to
 
05:08:47.070 --> 05:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
prepare a fiscal note for
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
us and I will move that as the chair um
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Greg will second that any
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on it this does not commit us
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
to the bill it just means we can then go
 
05:09:04.590 --> 05:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:07.150 --> 05:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
it that is the
 
05:09:09.150 --> 05:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
motion just so it's on the record I'll
 
05:09:10.948 --> 05:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
go and say that um the reason we're
 
05:09:12.750 --> 05:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
doing this is because we learned last
 
05:09:15.310 --> 05:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
time the courts do not make forms so we
 
05:09:16.270 --> 05:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
understand they're going to have to get
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
an outside resource and there will be a
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
cost for this so we're just trying to be
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
as responsible as we can with this bill
 
05:09:23.548 --> 05:09:23.558 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge we have that was a
 
05:09:25.590 --> 05:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
good catch on this representative so
 
05:09:27.150 --> 05:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
would the clerk please call the role on
 
05:09:30.270 --> 05:09:30.280 align:start position:0%

05:11:22.510 --> 05:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
243 with
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative chairman of I never get
 
05:11:28.590 --> 05:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
this right Fish game in Marine sources
 
05:11:31.030 --> 05:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
resource I'm getting closer each time
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
and it's House Bill 243 an act relative
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
to the penalty for false reports of
 
05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
suspected abuse and neglect made to the
 
05:11:42.670 --> 05:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
division for children youth and families
 
05:11:46.110 --> 05:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
and just before the uh break we counted
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
67 in favor and four opposed online and
 
05:11:51.788 --> 05:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the numbers are continuing to
 
05:11:54.670 --> 05:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
to commend as we speak chairman Spain
 
05:11:56.350 --> 05:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
thank you present your bill please thank
 
05:11:58.190 --> 05:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
05:11:59.628 --> 05:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh again this will look familiar this is
 
05:12:01.230 --> 05:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
the same exact bill that was passed
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
through the house three times last term
 
05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you're wondering how could
 
05:12:07.708 --> 05:12:07.718 align:start position:0%
you do it three times in one term well
 
05:12:09.430 --> 05:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
especially with an evenly divided house
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
where we were basically 50/50 it's a
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
very bipartisan concern that people have
 
05:12:16.830 --> 05:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
with the weaponizing of the system uh
 
05:12:19.510 --> 05:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
there are 30 or so states that this is
 
05:12:20.948 --> 05:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
currently already a law there's a
 
05:12:22.510 --> 05:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
penalty in place when you do a false
 
05:12:25.390 --> 05:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
report ours is a little bit higher bar
 
05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure we we don't
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh just automatically start
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh scaring people from making reports so
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
you have to do the way this bill is
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
written it's uh you have to have made
 
05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
the complaint knowingly false with
 
05:12:42.270 --> 05:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
intent to harm which is very hard to
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
prove so it wouldn't happen to any
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
firsttime reporter it would only happen
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
to somebody who they could build up a
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
pattern of abuse against the system with
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
and uh because of this committee's
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
request last term we added a section
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
into um in fact I believe it was the
 
05:13:01.470 --> 05:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
chairman who asked asked for this to be
 
05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
to be added in uh that the there was a a
 
05:13:08.350 --> 05:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
section for professional mandatory
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
reporters who fail to make a report
 
05:13:12.510 --> 05:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
because we realize there's nothing in
 
05:13:14.270 --> 05:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
statute to put a penalty on somebody who
 
05:13:17.310 --> 05:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
is a professional reporter uh now you're
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
all mandatory reporters everyone is so
 
05:13:20.910 --> 05:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure we made a
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
distinction that they're professional
 
05:13:24.070 --> 05:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporters those who are in the
 
05:13:26.310 --> 05:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
profession and trained and if they fail
 
05:13:28.270 --> 05:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
to make a report they also could get a
 
05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
penalty so the way this passed through
 
05:13:31.948 --> 05:13:31.958 align:start position:0%
the house three times last term was that
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
I passed it through in the very first
 
05:13:36.628 --> 05:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
year and it became the house position
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
although the Senate retained it um when
 
05:13:42.990 --> 05:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
I introduced it in the second year
 
05:13:46.670 --> 05:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
exactly as it was the same it was again
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
um tabled by the Senate and so then when
 
05:13:52.510 --> 05:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment came over from the Senate
 
05:13:55.628 --> 05:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
from the chairman of the committee over
 
05:13:58.150 --> 05:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
there I put it on that amend I put it as
 
05:13:59.628 --> 05:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
an amendment on that and we passed it
 
05:14:00.830 --> 05:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
through the house as an amendment to
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
that bill that came over from the Senate
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
and they killed that one too so we're
 
05:14:07.708 --> 05:14:07.718 align:start position:0%
back here again uh after passing this
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
through the house with with Democrat and
 
05:14:13.708 --> 05:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
Republican support and we're trying to
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
do it again hopefully we can get it
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
through the Senate this time and
 
05:14:18.350 --> 05:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get it through the house
 
05:14:21.190 --> 05:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
first yet again um I'll take any
 
05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone has them but
 
05:14:24.430 --> 05:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
everyone who was here in the committee
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
last term knows this one inside out and
 
05:14:29.868 --> 05:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
I I think you probably already
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
know representative Greg um thank you Mr
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and this is kind of a question
 
05:14:37.510 --> 05:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
but I think it might be helpful if you
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
go over it again just because at least
 
05:14:40.470 --> 05:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
half of our I think about half our
 
05:14:42.070 --> 05:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee is new so I think it would be
 
05:14:44.670 --> 05:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
helpful for you if that is the wish of
 
05:14:44.680 --> 05:14:45.310 align:start position:0%
helpful for you if that is the wish of
the

05:14:45.310 --> 05:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee so it does not prohibit
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
Anonymous reporting but it
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
encourages non-anonymous reports um
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
you'll see this new language that says
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
reports made to the department may
 
05:14:59.788 --> 05:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
include the name address or phone number
 
05:15:01.150 --> 05:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
of the person or person's making the
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
report of a suspected abuse or neglect
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
of a child under this chapter says they
 
05:15:07.230 --> 05:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
may they don't have to but the
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
department themselves said they they
 
05:15:10.990 --> 05:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
prefer if they have a name so they can
 
05:15:14.510 --> 05:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
follow up um so they liked that and this
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
language was actually uh drafted by the
 
05:15:22.708 --> 05:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
prior director of uh DCF and myself uh
 
05:15:26.830 --> 05:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
before he left and we have a new one now
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
um the department may also inform the
 
05:15:31.990 --> 05:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
complainant that should the complaint be
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
made maliciously or with intent to harm
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
the complainant may be subject to
 
05:15:38.590 --> 05:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
criminal and civil penalties this is an
 
05:15:38.600 --> 05:15:39.788 align:start position:0%
criminal and civil penalties this is an
option

05:15:39.788 --> 05:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
option
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
but I was told by the director of that
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
department that he would love to be able
 
05:15:46.830 --> 05:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
to have his employees be able to give
 
05:15:48.990 --> 05:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of verbal prodding if they
 
05:15:50.750 --> 05:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
know it's the same person calling yet
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
again because they said there's very few
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
of the people who take the calls and
 
05:15:55.628 --> 05:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
they tend to get to know a voice or a
 
05:15:58.230 --> 05:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
number and they might be able to stop
 
05:16:00.030 --> 05:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
things right there if they can give this
 
05:16:02.670 --> 05:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
warning so that's in there as well at
 
05:16:05.788 --> 05:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
the um as a May doesn't have to be done
 
05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
but at the discretion of the person
 
05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
taking the call it can be be uh given as
 
05:16:09.920 --> 05:16:10.788 align:start position:0%
taking the call it can be be uh given as
a

05:16:10.788 --> 05:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:16:13.548 --> 05:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
warning um there's a section new section
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
two under the immunity that says nothing
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
in this section shall provide civil or
 
05:16:18.750 --> 05:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
criminal immunity for a professional
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter who knowingly fails
 
05:16:23.070 --> 05:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
to make a report of suspected abuse or
 
05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
neglect under RSA 169 C colon 29 or for
 
05:16:29.948 --> 05:16:29.958 align:start position:0%
a person who knowingly files a false
 
05:16:32.948 --> 05:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
report of abuse or neglect with malice
 
05:16:38.230 --> 05:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
or the intent to harm under RSA 169c 31a
 
05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
that's the section that basically
 
05:16:44.590 --> 05:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
has the penalty for the false report but
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
also uh at the prodding of this
 
05:16:48.990 --> 05:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh puts a penalty in for those
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
people who fail to report so they can be
 
05:16:54.628 --> 05:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
held accountable um these would be
 
05:16:56.430 --> 05:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
professional people such as it
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
specifically says yeah only the
 
05:17:01.510 --> 05:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
professionals if they fail to report
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
professional mandatory
 
05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
reporter um but the other bit for making
 
05:17:10.270 --> 05:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
a false report as
 
05:17:14.548 --> 05:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
anyone and that's it that's the
 
05:17:18.548 --> 05:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
extent the um penalties are already in
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
different rsas and I assume that the the
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
reference to those was one of those
 
05:17:24.190 --> 05:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
things that the Senate wanted because
 
05:17:25.590 --> 05:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
that way it was not something that we
 
05:17:27.788 --> 05:17:27.798 align:start position:0%
were introducing a new penalty if the
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
penalty gets updated and the other one
 
05:17:30.910 --> 05:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
we're still referencing that one and
 
05:17:32.390 --> 05:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's done in one place for a cleaner
 
05:17:33.628 --> 05:17:33.638 align:start position:0%
bill I
 
05:17:36.350 --> 05:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
don't originally my original language
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
many years ago said it was a misdemeanor
 
05:17:40.510 --> 05:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
that's now referencing other areas where
 
05:17:44.430 --> 05:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor still so it's still a
 
05:17:46.670 --> 05:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor are you open the questions I
 
05:17:48.670 --> 05:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
am open to questions one question I
 
05:17:51.628 --> 05:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
would have I love to I love to see what
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
other states do but then I like to go
 
05:17:55.628 --> 05:17:55.638 align:start position:0%
into a little bit of detail and if a
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
bill sounds kind of conservative what do
 
05:18:01.310 --> 05:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
liberal states do and vice versa just to
 
05:18:03.670 --> 05:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
see if maybe this isn't a conservative
 
05:18:06.270 --> 05:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
or a liberal thing states of all kinds
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
and shades of colors um are in on it or
 
05:18:12.708 --> 05:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
in some way or other um I know that
 
05:18:14.670 --> 05:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in New York has some
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
pretty in California okay it has some
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
pretty strict penalties on this in in
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
your knowledge has this led to a
 
05:18:24.670 --> 05:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
significant diminution of complaints and
 
05:18:26.470 --> 05:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
other words people are scared off no and
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
I think if you asked the uh the
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
divisions in both all three of those
 
05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
States uh if they are getting plenty of
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
reports they would agree that they have
 
05:18:37.350 --> 05:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
more than they can
 
05:18:41.788 --> 05:18:41.798 align:start position:0%
handle but the false ones are not being
 
05:18:45.310 --> 05:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
done as proliferant because they can
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
actually penalize people uh one of the
 
05:18:50.948 --> 05:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
things that I find egregious that this I
 
05:18:52.750 --> 05:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
will we can hopefully fix by passing
 
05:18:54.830 --> 05:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
this is that if I went out right now and
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
pulled a fire alarm for no reason I
 
05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
could get charged with something if I
 
05:19:01.830 --> 05:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
went and made a false police
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
report I could get charged with
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
something but the way our law is written
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
right now if my neighbor decides to have
 
05:19:11.990 --> 05:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
his dog poop in my front yard and I
 
05:19:14.190 --> 05:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
didn't like it I could call up and
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
report him as abusing his kids and
 
05:19:18.430 --> 05:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that can be done even if
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
they know it's me who did it in fact
 
05:19:22.948 --> 05:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
even if I call up every week and report
 
05:19:25.750 --> 05:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
him for abusing his kids there's nothing
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
they can do and dcyf is under an
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to investigate every claim
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
they get and that takes away the
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
resources from other cases where they
 
05:19:36.548 --> 05:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
really should be spending their time
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
real cases of abuse and instead they're
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
chasing down dead ends from family
 
05:19:43.590 --> 05:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
members one of the things that was told
 
05:19:46.150 --> 05:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
to me by the the other director of dcyf
 
05:19:48.510 --> 05:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
who's who's now left he said that one of
 
05:19:50.230 --> 05:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
the biggest problems they had was once
 
05:19:52.830 --> 05:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
the opioid epidemic got really big and
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
they were losing parents to
 
05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
incarceration or overdoses and the
 
05:20:00.430 --> 05:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
children were being placed with
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
grandparents they found a surge in the
 
05:20:04.548 --> 05:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
number of complaints they were trying to
 
05:20:06.750 --> 05:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
handle because this grandparent thought
 
05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
they should have custody and if they
 
05:20:11.070 --> 05:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
made complaints about that grandparent
 
05:20:12.788 --> 05:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
then they could get the custody of the
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
kids and they were not true complaints
 
05:20:18.030 --> 05:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
there was no real danger to the children
 
05:20:19.948 --> 05:20:19.958 align:start position:0%
but they were being the system was being
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
weaponized because they realized there's
 
05:20:24.270 --> 05:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
nothing they can do if I make those
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
complaints it's also weaponized in the
 
05:20:27.910 --> 05:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
case of divorce a
 
05:20:31.548 --> 05:20:31.558 align:start position:0%
lot any questions representative Raymond
 
05:20:33.670 --> 05:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um thank you
 
05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative um so as I don't know if
 
05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knows but as a lot of people
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
know I actually work worked for child
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
protective services in New York for many
 
05:20:43.270 --> 05:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
years where they have a similar law um
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
but you're not allowed to report
 
05:20:48.190 --> 05:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
anonymously in New York and um frankly a
 
05:20:50.230 --> 05:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
lot of the malicious reporting that we
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
got when I worked there was in the cases
 
05:20:54.910 --> 05:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
of um domestic violence or an
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
acrimonious divorce um I never once saw
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
in all the years um anybody get
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for this uh which I think
 
05:21:06.270 --> 05:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
I've said before my question is about um
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
how this bill will address the people
 
05:21:12.190 --> 05:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
who are going to continue to call
 
05:21:15.390 --> 05:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
anonymously to report their ex or their
 
05:21:17.070 --> 05:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
neighbor or the person that they're
 
05:21:20.910 --> 05:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
angry at um because I think right now um
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
anybody can do that anonymously the bill
 
05:21:25.030 --> 05:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the ability to do it
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
anonymously and the people up at the
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
state um have a lot of training on how
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
to identify whether or not something
 
05:21:36.270 --> 05:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
seems like it's um a legitimate
 
05:21:38.070 --> 05:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
complaint versus not like they ask a lot
 
05:21:39.628 --> 05:21:39.638 align:start position:0%
of questions and they have decision
 
05:21:42.030 --> 05:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
trees um and if we learned this morning
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
that they screen out a good percentage
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
of the calls that come in already
 
05:21:47.990 --> 05:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
because they don't meet the criteria so
 
05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is how do you see
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
this spill
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
impacting like the the anonymous
 
05:21:56.030 --> 05:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
situation and also you know the
 
05:21:58.270 --> 05:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
maliciousness that you're alleging
 
05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
happen thank you for the question
 
05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative um you know if it was up
 
05:22:03.470 --> 05:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
to me I would love to remove the
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
anonymous uh ability to the ability to
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
make an anonymous complaint as well but
 
05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
um um I was told by the department and
 
05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
people who worked there that that they
 
05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
had concerns about that and so in an
 
05:22:19.868 --> 05:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
effort to try to get something done to
 
05:22:21.470 --> 05:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
get at least some amount of
 
05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
accountability to prevent those that
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
where where the person was known and I
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
there's an example I could give you from
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
um one of the people who called me and I
 
05:22:34.470 --> 05:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
get I get more and more calls every year
 
05:22:35.868 --> 05:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
every year that this bill is going
 
05:22:37.270 --> 05:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
forward and especially when it hits the
 
05:22:38.830 --> 05:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
papers as a person from the the Press
 
05:22:41.948 --> 05:22:41.958 align:start position:0%
here today that was talking about it um
 
05:22:43.628 --> 05:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
I get more and more complaints and and
 
05:22:45.110 --> 05:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
calls from people that I don't even
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
represent in my district but they heard
 
05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
about the bill and they want to tell me
 
05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
their story so there's a woman in um
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
another part of the state and I won't
 
05:22:55.230 --> 05:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
say the area but um mother of four two
 
05:22:57.310 --> 05:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
sets of twins going through a divorce
 
05:22:59.948 --> 05:22:59.958 align:start position:0%
that was taking 5 years and was getting
 
05:23:02.190 --> 05:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
calls once a month or so from the
 
05:23:04.750 --> 05:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
girlfriend of the ex-husband the new
 
05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
girlfriend of the ex-husband in an
 
05:23:10.270 --> 05:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
effort to try to change the way that the
 
05:23:14.350 --> 05:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
divorce outcome would happen
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
um she had to basically talk to them
 
05:23:20.670 --> 05:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
about the complaint every single month
 
05:23:23.070 --> 05:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
once a month and it caused stress in the
 
05:23:25.030 --> 05:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
family it caused stress to her they knew
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
who it was calling she didn't do it
 
05:23:29.350 --> 05:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
anonymously but there was nothing they
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
could do and um those false reports were
 
05:23:37.788 --> 05:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
made exactly fitting what we would call
 
05:23:42.270 --> 05:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
maliciously with intent to harm um
 
05:23:45.590 --> 05:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
so I've seen many of these and this
 
05:23:49.070 --> 05:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
would at least handle some level of it
 
05:23:50.590 --> 05:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
and whether in the future somebody
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
decides to remove all of the anonymous
 
05:23:52.480 --> 05:23:53.310 align:start position:0%
decides to remove all of the anonymous
part

05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
part
 
05:23:55.708 --> 05:23:55.718 align:start position:0%
too that's fine in my opinion you
 
05:23:57.070 --> 05:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to make such an
 
05:24:00.270 --> 05:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
egregious complaint anonymously um but
 
05:24:02.310 --> 05:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're here for today
 
05:24:02.320 --> 05:24:03.868 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're here for today
okay

05:24:03.868 --> 05:24:03.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:24:06.670 --> 05:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
quick followup representative Rond thank
 
05:24:08.070 --> 05:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman my other question was
 
05:24:10.750 --> 05:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
about um the definition of a
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
professional mandatory reporter is that
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
term defined anywhere else in statute um
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
because I'm curious if this impacts
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
someone who has a professional job who
 
05:24:22.830 --> 05:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
is reporting as a citizen or only if
 
05:24:24.430 --> 05:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
they're reporting in their professional
 
05:24:27.150 --> 05:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
capacity and how um the law might
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
interpret this like if I if if we have a
 
05:24:31.470 --> 05:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who's shopping at Walmart and he
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
sees you know a kid being you know
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
violently shaken or abused at Walmart is
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
he now a professional mandated reporter
 
05:24:41.070 --> 05:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
or is he a citizen who happens to have a
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
job that professionally he would also
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
have to report good question I do not
 
05:24:49.628 --> 05:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
know I trusted OS to take the language
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
that the chair gave me as he himself as
 
05:24:55.390 --> 05:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
a professional mandatory reporter um and
 
05:24:57.868 --> 05:24:57.878 align:start position:0%
for them to craft around it but it might
 
05:25:00.750 --> 05:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
be something good to look into to find
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
out if it's defined somewhere but also
 
05:25:05.708 --> 05:25:05.718 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the professional mandatory
 
05:25:07.990 --> 05:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
reporter part is only a penalty if they
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
fail fa to report under the statute that
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
says that they are a mandatory reporter
 
05:25:16.510 --> 05:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
the the regular false reports is
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
everybody so so if the professional
 
05:25:19.600 --> 05:25:21.430 align:start position:0%
everybody so so if the professional
mandatory

05:25:21.430 --> 05:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
05:25:24.628 --> 05:25:24.638 align:start position:0%
reporter saw somebody in the supermarket
 
05:25:27.548 --> 05:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
and walked by I can't see how they'd be
 
05:25:28.628 --> 05:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
under the
 
05:25:31.150 --> 05:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
obligation as their job and I don't
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
think that would apply but it's a
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
question for OS well yeah I guess that's
 
05:25:36.628 --> 05:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
my question because if if if they're
 
05:25:38.350 --> 05:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
professionally in their job if they saw
 
05:25:39.708 --> 05:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
in their waiting room they would have to
 
05:25:41.430 --> 05:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
call but if they're at Walmart and they
 
05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
see it and they don't call are they
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to the same kind of
 
05:25:46.990 --> 05:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
penalties since we are all mandated
 
05:25:49.990 --> 05:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
reporters I I imagine that uh first
 
05:25:52.110 --> 05:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
you'd have to figure out who was going
 
05:25:54.548 --> 05:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
to know that he was a doctor in Walmart
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
that didn't report but I don't know
 
05:25:59.788 --> 05:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
newshire we all know each other but but
 
05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
in in any case it's a very good question
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
and I I would um certainly go and ask uh
 
05:26:07.670 --> 05:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
further questions if you'd like me to uh
 
05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
and get an answer back for the committee
 
05:26:10.750 --> 05:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
I might suggest or you could have your
 
05:26:12.750 --> 05:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
researcher do it well I might suggest
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative that um uh you you chase
 
05:26:18.750 --> 05:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
this one down also while you're going to
 
05:26:20.350 --> 05:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
be making an amendment I'm not going to
 
05:26:22.670 --> 05:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
exec this for a bit
 
05:26:26.910 --> 05:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
um the 500 section of
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm totally blanking what's that
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
pink book that I've read so many times
 
05:26:35.070 --> 05:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
oh Rules of Evidence the 500 section uh
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
deals with privilege communication so if
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
if a mandatory reporter Witnesses
 
05:26:42.510 --> 05:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
something in certain professional
 
05:26:45.788 --> 05:26:45.798 align:start position:0%
capacities that person can't report so
 
05:26:47.868 --> 05:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be a bad idea while you're
 
05:26:50.030 --> 05:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
fleshing out what a professional
 
05:26:52.830 --> 05:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter who knowingly fails
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
is you also take a look at the
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that I would hate to get
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
into a legal Crossfire between the 500
 
05:27:05.470 --> 05:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
section which is um lawyer client uh
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
Prest penitent which is 505 and 502 I
 
05:27:11.150 --> 05:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
think is lawyer and client and 503 is
 
05:27:13.230 --> 05:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
counselor and doctor and so on so in
 
05:27:14.750 --> 05:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
other words while you're up might be
 
05:27:19.150 --> 05:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
good to really polish this one up
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative rice thank you
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:27:28.030 --> 05:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
question um so I kind of have two
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions go with the first one one
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
first first um so I'm concerned about
 
05:27:35.590 --> 05:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
the language it says the department May
 
05:27:39.070 --> 05:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
inform the complainant that should the
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
um complaint be made maliciously or with
 
05:27:43.110 --> 05:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
intent to harm the complaint it may be
 
05:27:45.788 --> 05:27:45.798 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal and civil civil
 
05:27:49.708 --> 05:27:49.718 align:start position:0%
penalties um I have concerns that
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
they're going to pick and choose who
 
05:27:52.470 --> 05:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to tell this to because it
 
05:27:55.948 --> 05:27:55.958 align:start position:0%
says may right they should be be doing
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
this if they're under penalty of my
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
trouble thank you thank you
 
05:28:03.070 --> 05:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative for the question my um my
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
original draft of that said they shall
 
05:28:07.788 --> 05:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
and the director of the dcyf department
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
said he didn't really want his people to
 
05:28:12.750 --> 05:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
have to say that to everyone they he
 
05:28:14.830 --> 05:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to let them make the choice under
 
05:28:17.150 --> 05:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
their own discretion because they had so
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
few people taking the calls that they
 
05:28:20.948 --> 05:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
got to know certain people who did it
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
often and they wanted to be able to give
 
05:28:24.270 --> 05:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
that warning to those people that they
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
knew was the same person calling yet
 
05:28:29.430 --> 05:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
again and so that was actually a request
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
from the Department that that changed
 
05:28:33.868 --> 05:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
from a sh to a May thank
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
you and under that the fact that it uses
 
05:28:40.548 --> 05:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
the word sub object to still gives
 
05:28:43.030 --> 05:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
discretionary power in other words
 
05:28:44.750 --> 05:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
you're vulnerable to it doesn't mean
 
05:28:48.310 --> 05:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to get it so the may just
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
heightens I think the their their point
 
05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
on this question two is there anything
 
05:28:56.708 --> 05:28:56.718 align:start position:0%
in the law that
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
prohibits someone
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
from taking civil action against someone
 
05:29:06.510 --> 05:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
for filing false reports because I know
 
05:29:08.270 --> 05:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
that you have it in here is is there
 
05:29:10.110 --> 05:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
anything that prohibits them from doing
 
05:29:12.190 --> 05:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
that without this being in
 
05:29:14.628 --> 05:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
the I don't know that it's specifically
 
05:29:17.390 --> 05:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited but uh I know that in the
 
05:29:19.990 --> 05:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
case when I had a false accusation made
 
05:29:22.230 --> 05:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
against me many years ago uh for
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
political reasons um the person did it
 
05:29:28.230 --> 05:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
anonymously and we weren't able to chase
 
05:29:31.110 --> 05:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
it down if they were
 
05:29:34.030 --> 05:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
prosecuted they would be able to then
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
have that extra evidence for the civil
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
case um so I don't know if there's
 
05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
anything that prohibits that but I know
 
05:29:44.310 --> 05:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
it can be expensive to defend yourself
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
against a false claim as well I know I
 
05:29:48.750 --> 05:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
dropped personally $4,000 on on a false
 
05:29:50.750 --> 05:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
claim U before it was considered
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
unfounded after two weeks of telling
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
them no you're not coming in the house
 
05:29:56.830 --> 05:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
but we can meet at the attorney's
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
office so thank you anyone else on the
 
05:30:03.350 --> 05:30:03.360 align:start position:0%

DCF good afternoon Mr chair chairman and

Susan larby I am general counsel and
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division for
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
children youth and families I'm here
 
05:30:44.910 --> 05:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
basically to answer any questions you
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
may have about this bill I recognize and
 
05:30:50.030 --> 05:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
we all recognize as part of
 
05:30:53.070 --> 05:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
dcyf that you all have worked very hard
 
05:30:54.430 --> 05:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
on this bill especially the
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative sponsoring the bill and
 
05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
working with former director ribson on
 
05:31:01.708 --> 05:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
this uh so we take no position as to the
 
05:31:04.510 --> 05:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
bill itself we absolutely recognize the
 
05:31:07.390 --> 05:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
need to balance that civil and criminal
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
immunity for those who are in good faith
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
seeing something saying something that
 
05:31:15.190 --> 05:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
no in tell campaign that we've all
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
worked on over the years with
 
05:31:19.070 --> 05:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders see something say something
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
when you have good faith to believe that
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
a child has been abused or neglected
 
05:31:26.590 --> 05:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
that we all have to watch out for our
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
children and to balance that with those
 
05:31:32.670 --> 05:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
who weaponize that reporting so of
 
05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
course we recognize that there is a a
 
05:31:37.030 --> 05:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
balance to that what I was going to
 
05:31:38.430 --> 05:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
testify to
 
05:31:40.590 --> 05:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
has already been addressed the bill that
 
05:31:43.110 --> 05:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
we received to do a fiscal note on still
 
05:31:45.390 --> 05:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
had the language shell that the
 
05:31:48.750 --> 05:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
department shall inform the caller that
 
05:31:50.990 --> 05:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
they could be held to civil or criminal
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
liability and that was what we took
 
05:31:55.150 --> 05:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
issue with in the bill because when
 
05:31:57.030 --> 05:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking with the
 
05:32:00.030 --> 05:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
caller it is so important for the
 
05:32:02.548 --> 05:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
central intake worker the social worker
 
05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
to get as much information from that
 
05:32:08.350 --> 05:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
caller as possible about the fact
 
05:32:10.910 --> 05:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
how they know why they know that this
 
05:32:12.788 --> 05:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
children this child could have been
 
05:32:15.150 --> 05:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
abused or neglected and that also
 
05:32:17.868 --> 05:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
includes working with that caller to
 
05:32:20.830 --> 05:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable to give them their name
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
their contact
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
information because not only is the
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
caller talking to that witness later on
 
05:32:30.670 --> 05:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
if that gets screened in and referred
 
05:32:32.948 --> 05:32:32.958 align:start position:0%
for an investigation to an assessment
 
05:32:35.190 --> 05:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
worker that assessment worker is going
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
to want to call and talk with that work
 
05:32:40.190 --> 05:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
worker uh talk with that caller and get
 
05:32:43.230 --> 05:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
more information do a full interview
 
05:32:46.110 --> 05:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
with that caller and if we were to tell
 
05:32:49.110 --> 05:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
them hey by the way just so you know and
 
05:32:51.990 --> 05:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
then regurgitate what it says here that
 
05:32:55.350 --> 05:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
you can be uh if you made this call with
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
Mali malicious intent or with intent to
 
05:33:00.110 --> 05:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
harm you may be subject to criminal or
 
05:33:02.548 --> 05:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
civil liabilities we're afraid that it
 
05:33:04.750 --> 05:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
would have unint the opposite unintended
 
05:33:06.590 --> 05:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
results they would immediately hang up
 
05:33:09.830 --> 05:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
and not be cooperative with with the um
 
05:33:12.030 --> 05:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh experience that's so important that
 
05:33:14.070 --> 05:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
they give us that information and
 
05:33:18.670 --> 05:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
typically they do out of the 27,000
 
05:33:21.150 --> 05:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
reports to Central intake in this fiscal
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
year of 2024 only just over a thousand
 
05:33:27.910 --> 05:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
were uh Anonymous
 
05:33:30.788 --> 05:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
1,23 and I think again that comes to
 
05:33:33.868 --> 05:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
having that conversation with the caller
 
05:33:35.948 --> 05:33:35.958 align:start position:0%
hey hey tell us about this how do you
 
05:33:38.510 --> 05:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
know this why do you know this and to
 
05:33:40.430 --> 05:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
tell them that they could be held
 
05:33:42.150 --> 05:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
liable we think would have the
 
05:33:44.430 --> 05:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
unintended results so I'm happy to we're
 
05:33:46.628 --> 05:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
happy to see that the shell has been
 
05:33:48.430 --> 05:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
replaced with
 
05:33:52.070 --> 05:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
may as a followup uh to your question
 
05:33:54.150 --> 05:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
about is there a definition a
 
05:33:56.470 --> 05:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
professional reporter well it's a little
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
bit complicated because the law itself
 
05:34:00.910 --> 05:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
in 169
 
05:34:04.708 --> 05:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
c29 does give the laundry list of those
 
05:34:07.030 --> 05:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
professions that typically have the
 
05:34:09.470 --> 05:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
confidential privileged attached to
 
05:34:09.480 --> 05:34:10.470 align:start position:0%
confidential privileged attached to
their

05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
work and honestly I think that's why
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
people forget that very last sentence
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
because it go through any physician
 
05:34:19.750 --> 05:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
surgeon County Medical Examiner
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist resident intern dentist
 
05:34:25.708 --> 05:34:25.718 align:start position:0%
social worker daycare worker on and on
 
05:34:28.708 --> 05:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
and then the very last sentence says or
 
05:34:31.868 --> 05:34:31.878 align:start position:0%
any other person having reason to
 
05:34:34.110 --> 05:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
suspect that a child has been abused or
 
05:34:36.750 --> 05:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
neglected shell report so that laundry
 
05:34:39.390 --> 05:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
list uh
 
05:34:40.990 --> 05:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
is what we would consider the
 
05:34:41.000 --> 05:34:42.750 align:start position:0%
is what we would consider the
professional

05:34:42.750 --> 05:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
professional
 
05:34:44.910 --> 05:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
reporter and if there's any other
 
05:34:46.510 --> 05:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
questions you may have for me I'm happy
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:54.190 --> 05:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative sidel welcome
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:34:57.708 --> 05:34:57.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just I uh could you
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
repeat the r could you be a little
 
05:35:01.670 --> 05:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic please are you able to
 
05:35:03.310 --> 05:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
repeat the RSA that you were referring
 
05:35:05.110 --> 05:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
to with the laundry list please yes so
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
the mandatory reporting statute is our
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
29 does that have and I'm not going to
 
05:35:20.948 --> 05:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
run back to get it but um does that have
 
05:35:23.948 --> 05:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
any carve out for uh privileg
 
05:35:29.510 --> 05:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:33.230 --> 05:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
assumed no um because again it's it's
 
05:35:35.590 --> 05:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
implied that this is because these
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
professions have that profession
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
professional confidentiality attached
 
05:35:43.390 --> 05:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
with their their licensing um I know
 
05:35:46.030 --> 05:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
Healthcare has it specifically in their
 
05:35:48.868 --> 05:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
one of their statues referring to Health
 
05:35:53.750 --> 05:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
Care um I don't have that in front of
 
05:35:56.910 --> 05:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you uh representative
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%

can you tell us a little bit about the
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
um people who work up at Central intake
 
05:36:09.868 --> 05:36:09.878 align:start position:0%
are they like dispatch officers like
 
05:36:12.310 --> 05:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
when you call to report a car accident
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
or a crime or are they more social
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
workers who have an interview process
 
05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
with the person calling sure uh during
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
the day and I believe the hours are 8 to
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
5:30 it is staffed by a cpsw staff so
 
05:36:32.470 --> 05:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
Child Protection social worker somebody
 
05:36:34.350 --> 05:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
typically who is not hired to be Central
 
05:36:36.270 --> 05:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
intake they have been hired to be an
 
05:36:38.230 --> 05:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
assistant worker a field work and they
 
05:36:40.350 --> 05:36:40.360 align:start position:0%

05:36:43.110 --> 05:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
central intake worker however after
 
05:36:45.310 --> 05:36:45.320 align:start position:0%

05:36:51.948 --> 05:36:51.958 align:start position:0%
weekends and holidays it is staffed by
 
05:36:53.708 --> 05:36:53.718 align:start position:0%

Bingo good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
05:38:07.070 --> 05:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
members of the child and family law
 
05:38:09.190 --> 05:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Emily Lawrence and
 
05:38:12.190 --> 05:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
I'm the advocacy director with Waypoint
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
um just to give you a little background
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
on Waypoint we are an a Statewide agency
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
that provides services for Children and
 
05:38:23.470 --> 05:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
Families those Services include um
 
05:38:25.470 --> 05:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
court-ordered services for families that
 
05:38:27.868 --> 05:38:27.878 align:start position:0%
are involved in dcyf the division for
 
05:38:29.350 --> 05:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
children youth and families so those
 
05:38:32.270 --> 05:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
could be inhome Services as well as
 
05:38:34.548 --> 05:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
community- based voluntary services for
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
families that are at risk of involvement
 
05:38:38.468 --> 05:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
with the the division for children youth
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
and families um we also do supervised
 
05:38:45.750 --> 05:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
visitation um and family
 
05:38:49.150 --> 05:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
reunification and permanency among other
 
05:38:52.110 --> 05:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
things that relate to this Bill I'm here
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
today to testify in opposition to this
 
05:38:56.830 --> 05:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
bill and I just want to share I outlined
 
05:38:58.830 --> 05:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
my concerns and my written testimony so
 
05:39:00.430 --> 05:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to share a couple of points
 
05:39:03.788 --> 05:39:03.798 align:start position:0%
of concern our main concern is that the
 
05:39:05.310 --> 05:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
bill will have a chilling effect on
 
05:39:08.070 --> 05:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
reporters I want to be clear that we do
 
05:39:09.788 --> 05:39:09.798 align:start position:0%
understand concerns about false
 
05:39:13.190 --> 05:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
reporting um I in my prior role had
 
05:39:16.670 --> 05:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
heard those concerns and I don't want to
 
05:39:19.270 --> 05:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
dismiss them but I think for us the
 
05:39:21.868 --> 05:39:21.878 align:start position:0%
importance is the safety of the child
 
05:39:24.430 --> 05:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
and so I'm worried that the that the
 
05:39:26.990 --> 05:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
average person may already be reluctant
 
05:39:29.670 --> 05:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
to report because they may not want to
 
05:39:31.750 --> 05:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
interfere or disrupt a family's life
 
05:39:33.548 --> 05:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
they may not be intimidated by the
 
05:39:36.468 --> 05:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
reporting process and so they may not
 
05:39:38.708 --> 05:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate or even read the statute to
 
05:39:40.510 --> 05:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
know that they would have to do it they
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
would have to knowingly and with
 
05:39:45.190 --> 05:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
malicious intent file a false report so
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm worrying that this will in further
 
05:39:51.110 --> 05:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
decrease reports for abuse and neglect I
 
05:39:53.270 --> 05:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
think there are also concerns when there
 
05:39:55.830 --> 05:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
are situations of domestic violence
 
05:39:58.830 --> 05:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
where um the almost what people are
 
05:40:01.628 --> 05:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
worried about happening right now for
 
05:40:03.390 --> 05:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill could happen in
 
05:40:06.350 --> 05:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
the flip in that someone could weaponize
 
05:40:09.230 --> 05:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
this bill against a victim saying well
 
05:40:10.590 --> 05:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
if you're going to report this I'm going
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
to say you did it knowingly and Mal with
 
05:40:15.548 --> 05:40:15.558 align:start position:0%
malicious intent and so victims may be
 
05:40:18.510 --> 05:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
reluctant to report a legitimate abuse
 
05:40:19.548 --> 05:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
happening um so those are our primary
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
concerns I will note and this has
 
05:40:27.310 --> 05:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
already been discussed that there is
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
some concern with the language of um
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
that you've already discussed about
 
05:40:34.990 --> 05:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
professional mandated reporter I think
 
05:40:37.310 --> 05:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
that there could be some if if the
 
05:40:39.150 --> 05:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is inclined to pass the
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
statute there should be some clarity
 
05:40:43.948 --> 05:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
introduced into that and perhaps even
 
05:40:47.110 --> 05:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
just referring back to the um
 
05:40:50.190 --> 05:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
professions that are enumerated in 169
 
05:40:52.948 --> 05:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
c29 would be helpful so that people
 
05:40:55.468 --> 05:40:55.478 align:start position:0%
people are given notice um if they are
 
05:40:58.190 --> 05:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
considered a professional mandated
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
reporter um again if the legislature is
 
05:41:04.910 --> 05:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
inclined to pass this law we would also
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh suggest that there are alternatives
 
05:41:11.548 --> 05:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
to the immediate op option of a
 
05:41:14.110 --> 05:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um several other states and
 
05:41:15.788 --> 05:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
I believe Mr chairman had mentioned
 
05:41:18.070 --> 05:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts earlier have different
 
05:41:20.390 --> 05:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
approaches Massachusetts and I put all
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
of these in my written testimony if you
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
want to see has a graduated approach so
 
05:41:28.270 --> 05:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
the first two calls would be um for
 
05:41:31.070 --> 05:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
fines and then the the third call would
 
05:41:34.948 --> 05:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
be for a criminal penalty um Maine
 
05:41:36.948 --> 05:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
simply exempts people from civil and
 
05:41:39.510 --> 05:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
Criminal immunity and then Connecticut
 
05:41:41.948 --> 05:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
gives the judge the option so the judge
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
can choose whether it is um a civil
 
05:41:47.310 --> 05:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
penalty with a fine or whether it's a
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty so I would argue that
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
those are um a bit less daunting for
 
05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
people so uh again if people are
 
05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
reluctant to call then maybe that would
 
05:42:00.670 --> 05:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
make them less reluctant if they weren't
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
worried that right off the bat it could
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
potentially be a
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so those our concerns and
 
05:42:10.230 --> 05:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions at any
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
time thank you very
 
05:42:17.230 --> 05:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
much I'm H how would you
 
05:42:19.948 --> 05:42:19.958 align:start position:0%
compare the statement that was made
 
05:42:23.110 --> 05:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
earlier that states with
 
05:42:26.430 --> 05:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
penalties have not seen a diminution of
 
05:42:30.150 --> 05:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
calling with with your statement you are
 
05:42:33.628 --> 05:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
speculating that it would cause a
 
05:42:37.230 --> 05:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
shortfall but it seems that the evidence
 
05:42:38.590 --> 05:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
is that it's
 
05:42:43.628 --> 05:42:43.638 align:start position:0%
not um I would agreed that I don't have
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
data to show that that actually happens
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
um it it doesn't mean it doesn't it's
 
05:42:51.390 --> 05:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
just that I'm not sure that states have
 
05:42:53.708 --> 05:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
we did look for that data and we were
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
not able to find any I think From
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
waypoint's perspective it really is
 
05:43:02.110 --> 05:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
about protecting children and so that
 
05:43:04.430 --> 05:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
would that is our primary concern that
 
05:43:07.390 --> 05:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
we would not want one child to go abused
 
05:43:09.150 --> 05:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
or neglected because someone was leery
 
05:43:09.160 --> 05:43:11.030 align:start position:0%
or neglected because someone was leery
of

05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
reporting would it be abuse of a
 
05:43:19.548 --> 05:43:19.558 align:start position:0%
child if frivolous complaints were
 
05:43:22.510 --> 05:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
regularly made against the house that
 
05:43:24.910 --> 05:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
child lives in the parents in particular
 
05:43:27.270 --> 05:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that traumatize the child that
 
05:43:29.270 --> 05:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are all these investigations going
 
05:43:31.750 --> 05:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
on wouldn't that hurt I think if you
 
05:43:35.190 --> 05:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
have multiple repeated investigations
 
05:43:38.310 --> 05:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
possibly but I also think that DCF um
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard that they ask a number of
 
05:43:43.230 --> 05:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
questions they are Adept and experts at
 
05:43:45.390 --> 05:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
screening people in or screening people
 
05:43:48.468 --> 05:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
out um so I know that a lot of those
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
calls are caught right from the
 
05:43:51.520 --> 05:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
calls are caught right from the
get-go

05:43:53.030 --> 05:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
get-go
 
05:43:58.350 --> 05:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
would um the reference to RSA 169 c29
 
05:44:01.590 --> 05:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
which defines as we heard professionals
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
be adequately close to the statement
 
05:44:07.270 --> 05:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
professional mandatory reporter because
 
05:44:09.310 --> 05:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
it's in the same sentence would would
 
05:44:12.910 --> 05:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
that be close enough to Define uh who a
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
professional you mean referring to those
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
Professionals in there yeah you said
 
05:44:19.590 --> 05:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
that a vague term but it's defined in
 
05:44:22.830 --> 05:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
the same sentence by shooting us to a
 
05:44:27.750 --> 05:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
oursa reference oh it is to it page page
 
05:44:29.430 --> 05:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
I missed it I missed it the first couple
 
05:44:31.750 --> 05:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
of times reading it through myself but
 
05:44:37.510 --> 05:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's in page two Roman 2 um bold italic
 
05:44:39.990 --> 05:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall and then
 
05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
it goes on professional mandatory
 
05:44:45.990 --> 05:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
reporter under RSA 169 c29 would that
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
satisfy the concerns you raise that does
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
there you may want to ALS uh it's also
 
05:44:56.390 --> 05:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:00.548 --> 05:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
one um and so I guess you it could
 
05:45:04.110 --> 05:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
arguably be implied since 169 c29 that's
 
05:45:07.628 --> 05:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
on line 24 of page 1 it's also
 
05:45:10.030 --> 05:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
referenced there I I would still argue
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
it could just be clearer for people but
 
05:45:18.510 --> 05:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:21.390 --> 05:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
questions no seeing none thank you thank
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
you oh sorry representative love good
 
05:45:26.190 --> 05:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:45:27.350 --> 05:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
05:45:29.910 --> 05:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
question um wouldn't the fact that we
 
05:45:29.920 --> 05:45:31.230 align:start position:0%
question um wouldn't the fact that we
have

05:45:31.230 --> 05:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:45:34.670 --> 05:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh Anonymous reporting nullify a lot
 
05:45:36.990 --> 05:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
of your fears uh it seems like you're
 
05:45:39.430 --> 05:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
afraid that that people won't report but
 
05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
they can still anonymously report uh it
 
05:45:45.350 --> 05:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
just doesn't add up to me certainly
 
05:45:47.628 --> 05:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
people could anonymously report I'm not
 
05:45:50.270 --> 05:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
sure everyone knows that either um so
 
05:45:51.670 --> 05:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
just like I don't think people would
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
read the statute to know about the
 
05:45:57.548 --> 05:45:57.558 align:start position:0%
possible pen penalty for malicious um
 
05:45:59.628 --> 05:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
false reporting I'm not sure they would
 
05:46:01.590 --> 05:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
know that they could anonymously report
 
05:46:03.150 --> 05:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't know that until
 
05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
they call in and I and I could be I
 
05:46:07.548 --> 05:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
don't want to over speak for the
 
05:46:09.150 --> 05:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
department but I'm sure the department
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
would prefer that people don't
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
anonymously report so they likely might
 
05:46:16.628 --> 05:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
ask for their name and people may not
 
05:46:18.510 --> 05:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
know that they don't have to give
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:25.548 --> 05:46:25.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thank
 
05:46:27.628 --> 05:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
you very much chair
 
05:46:31.150 --> 05:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
recognizes the uh senior clerk Jody
 
05:46:31.160 --> 05:46:33.708 align:start position:0%
recognizes the uh senior clerk Jody
Nelson

05:46:33.708 --> 05:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
Nelson
 
05:46:41.310 --> 05:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:43.468 --> 05:46:43.478 align:start position:0%
but only after she knocks you
 
05:46:47.190 --> 05:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
out that's why we have spares and
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:58.510 --> 05:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:47:01.030 --> 05:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
to the committee for uh listening to me
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
for a couple minutes this should not
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
take long uh one thing that I wanted to
 
05:47:07.750 --> 05:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
have us think about
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
is um the impact that some false
 
05:47:12.548 --> 05:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
reporting has on daycares um in my
 
05:47:14.510 --> 05:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with some people about this
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
bill um there are daycares that do have
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
false complaints reported against them
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
and there are definitely uh
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
repercussions for the daycare as well as
 
05:47:28.230 --> 05:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
the families um who attend daycare um
 
05:47:31.230 --> 05:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
long time ago about 20 years ago my
 
05:47:34.150 --> 05:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
daughter was about three and we had a
 
05:47:36.310 --> 05:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful situation with an at home
 
05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
daycare person who also um had
 
05:47:43.390 --> 05:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
previously watched um older cousins of
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
my daughters who had a very trust
 
05:47:47.910 --> 05:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
trusting and loving relationship with
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
this person and I received a phone call
 
05:47:53.868 --> 05:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts DCF and that person
 
05:47:56.590 --> 05:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
said hello Mrs Nelson I need to talk to
 
05:47:56.600 --> 05:47:58.110 align:start position:0%
said hello Mrs Nelson I need to talk to
you

05:47:58.110 --> 05:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:48:01.590 --> 05:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
about the daycare provider um we've had
 
05:48:04.708 --> 05:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
a report of child
 
05:48:07.590 --> 05:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
abuse against her and I need to get some
 
05:48:12.070 --> 05:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
details from you and I said well she
 
05:48:14.548 --> 05:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
um she has older children and her
 
05:48:15.948 --> 05:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
youngest is a senen her in high school
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
and I've only ever witnessed her being a
 
05:48:19.070 --> 05:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful mother she loves her kids so
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
much and he said he interrupted me he
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
said no Mrs Nelson I need to talk to you
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
about a report that's been filed that
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
has claimed she's been abusing your
 
05:48:36.190 --> 05:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
child so um to make a long story short
 
05:48:39.350 --> 05:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the the report was closed it was
 
05:48:42.150 --> 05:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
unfounded however myself and six other
 
05:48:44.468 --> 05:48:44.478 align:start position:0%
families had to immediately find
 
05:48:47.948 --> 05:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
alternate Child Care during the course
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the investigation that was
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%

05:48:56.270 --> 05:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
very understanding employer so taking
 
05:48:58.868 --> 05:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
three days off on an emergency basis and
 
05:49:00.948 --> 05:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
working from home was something that I
 
05:49:03.070 --> 05:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to do but I also know that
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
some of the other parents were concerned
 
05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%

other time we are a state agency a very
 
05:50:53.990 --> 05:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
very small one we are independent um
 
05:50:56.468 --> 05:50:56.478 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to das and we
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
are mandated as oversight to all child
 
05:51:02.590 --> 05:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
serving executive branch agencies we
 
05:51:05.868 --> 05:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
were created in 2017 in response to some
 
05:51:09.230 --> 05:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
tragic child deaths in the state our
 
05:51:11.910 --> 05:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
purview was then expanded in 2020 so now
 
05:51:14.230 --> 05:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
we cover All State agencies that impact
 
05:51:16.868 --> 05:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
children to include dcyf Child
 
05:51:20.230 --> 05:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
Protection Juvenile Justice um bcbh all
 
05:51:22.350 --> 05:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
of whom you heard from this morning as
 
05:51:24.548 --> 05:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
well as all contracted providers such as
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
Waypoint residential
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
facilities um and all service providers
 
05:51:31.868 --> 05:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
so we uh do both legislative work
 
05:51:33.830 --> 05:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
systemic work as well as we have a
 
05:51:36.270 --> 05:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
couple of ombudsmen who actually do case
 
05:51:37.868 --> 05:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
specific specific work they take calls
 
05:51:40.708 --> 05:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
about specific cases um of concern
 
05:51:42.990 --> 05:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
involving children in the state either
 
05:51:44.990 --> 05:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
not receiving services or not receiving
 
05:51:47.390 --> 05:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate services so we look forward
 
05:51:49.150 --> 05:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
to uh coming and talking to you more
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
soon as for right now um we are here to
 
05:51:56.788 --> 05:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 243 as currently written
 
05:51:58.390 --> 05:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
although it sounds like there might have
 
05:52:01.310 --> 05:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
already been changes since the published
 
05:52:04.468 --> 05:52:04.478 align:start position:0%
one that I last saw um this is similar
 
05:52:06.628 --> 05:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
to Prior legislation we have actually
 
05:52:08.750 --> 05:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
testified before you before over the
 
05:52:12.030 --> 05:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
last couple of years um essentially the
 
05:52:13.948 --> 05:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate was created to
 
05:52:15.948 --> 05:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
give a voice uh to the best interest of
 
05:52:17.750 --> 05:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
children and advocate for children
 
05:52:19.910 --> 05:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
particularly those involved with state
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
agencies like Child Protection in order
 
05:52:25.110 --> 05:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
to avoid um future child deaths uh
 
05:52:27.110 --> 05:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
issues like the harmony mcgomery case
 
05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you all know the high-profile
 
05:52:30.750 --> 05:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
ones but there's thousands of children
 
05:52:32.468 --> 05:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
that are affected by the system every
 
05:52:35.030 --> 05:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
day at a much lower level that doesn't
 
05:52:38.270 --> 05:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
make the news so just generally uh we
 
05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
oppose any legislation that would limit
 
05:52:42.230 --> 05:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
reporting of suspect suspected child
 
05:52:46.030 --> 05:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
abuse to the division or as um attorney
 
05:52:48.548 --> 05:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
Lawrence mentioned a chilling effect on
 
05:52:52.030 --> 05:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
reporting um when it said shall inform
 
05:52:54.468 --> 05:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
people that they could be reported that
 
05:52:56.110 --> 05:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
could have a chilling effect on someone
 
05:52:58.628 --> 05:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
who's calling as an attorney I would
 
05:53:00.510 --> 05:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
also say if it's May you now have a
 
05:53:02.948 --> 05:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
disperate impact or a potential like
 
05:53:04.990 --> 05:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
equal application problem of you're
 
05:53:06.910 --> 05:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing who you tell so if
 
05:53:08.270 --> 05:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
someone gets penalties and they're like
 
05:53:10.750 --> 05:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
well no one ever told me that's also a
 
05:53:13.390 --> 05:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
problem um we would uh be concerned
 
05:53:15.948 --> 05:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
about the chilling effect um as others
 
05:53:18.548 --> 05:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
have mentioned um we do still allow
 
05:53:21.390 --> 05:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
Anonymous reporting here we are in favor
 
05:53:23.510 --> 05:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
of that in order to allow everyone to
 
05:53:24.910 --> 05:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
make a report even if they're not
 
05:53:27.390 --> 05:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable sharing their name however I
 
05:53:29.750 --> 05:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
believe attorney larab be mentioned most
 
05:53:31.510 --> 05:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
people do share their names and that is
 
05:53:33.910 --> 05:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
important because the dcyf assessment
 
05:53:35.670 --> 05:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
worker does follow up and get some
 
05:53:38.708 --> 05:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
really important information so anyone
 
05:53:42.270 --> 05:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
who is told we may use your name to uh
 
05:53:44.468 --> 05:53:44.478 align:start position:0%
hold you criminally liable May withhold
 
05:53:46.868 --> 05:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
their name frankly I I believe
 
05:53:48.350 --> 05:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond al already
 
05:53:49.868 --> 05:53:49.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned if you're allowed to be
 
05:53:51.750 --> 05:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
anonymous and you're making a malicious
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
or false report the chances are you're
 
05:53:55.708 --> 05:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
going to stay Anonymous you're not going
 
05:53:58.830 --> 05:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
to give your name anyway so just as a
 
05:54:01.750 --> 05:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
practical matter the impact of this law
 
05:54:04.230 --> 05:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
might not be that great as folks who are
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
planning on giving false information
 
05:54:08.670 --> 05:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
probably would already not give their
 
05:54:11.868 --> 05:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
name um in
 
05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
addition people trying to make a good
 
05:54:19.070 --> 05:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
faith report may be inhibited um with
 
05:54:20.830 --> 05:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
that warning or even if they just heard
 
05:54:23.390 --> 05:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
about this law um as a further matter
 
05:54:25.150 --> 05:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been mentioned yet the uh
 
05:54:27.548 --> 05:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
dcyf Central intake workers as mentioned
 
05:54:30.070 --> 05:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
by attorney larab B are social workers
 
05:54:32.590 --> 05:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
their jobs are to determine if a child
 
05:54:34.708 --> 05:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
has been abused or neglected uh and to
 
05:54:37.190 --> 05:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
determine Central intake specific
 
05:54:39.310 --> 05:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
whether the facts being told to them
 
05:54:41.548 --> 05:54:41.558 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of even being screened
 
05:54:44.948 --> 05:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
in um last session the DCF director
 
05:54:46.708 --> 05:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
testified that this bill wasn't
 
05:54:48.670 --> 05:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
necessary false reporting really wasn't
 
05:54:51.150 --> 05:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
an issue that dcyf is really doing a
 
05:54:54.030 --> 05:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
fine job of screening out reports that
 
05:54:56.628 --> 05:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
don't rise the level if even if they are
 
05:54:58.670 --> 05:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
investigated if the facts are not
 
05:55:01.110 --> 05:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
ascertained to rise to a statutory level
 
05:55:02.910 --> 05:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
for the definitions of abuse neglect
 
05:55:05.310 --> 05:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
they're unfounded now unfounded doesn't
 
05:55:06.910 --> 05:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
mean false
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
but someone who's calling who isn't sure
 
05:55:11.390 --> 05:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
if it's abuse or neglect certainly might
 
05:55:15.430 --> 05:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
feel well if I'm wrong am I going to be
 
05:55:18.788 --> 05:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
prosecuted so again this use of the word
 
05:55:21.670 --> 05:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
false a doesn't mean the person knowing
 
05:55:23.350 --> 05:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
giving the information believes it to be
 
05:55:26.430 --> 05:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
untrue but also an unfounded report does
 
05:55:28.350 --> 05:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
not mean it's false it means that it
 
05:55:31.270 --> 05:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
didn't rise to the statutory level so I
 
05:55:33.030 --> 05:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
think constructionwise there's a lot of
 
05:55:35.510 --> 05:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
terms in here that are just problematic
 
05:55:38.468 --> 05:55:38.478 align:start position:0%
and would be incredibly difficult to
 
05:55:41.548 --> 05:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
enforce and also who's going to enforce
 
05:55:44.948 --> 05:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
this it is not dcf's job to determine
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
the intent of the person calling they're
 
05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
not trying to determine if the
 
05:55:51.468 --> 05:55:51.478 align:start position:0%
information is malicious if it's given
 
05:55:53.788 --> 05:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
knowingly falsely their job is to
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
protect kids and we want them to remain
 
05:55:59.628 --> 05:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
laser focused on that task to determine
 
05:56:02.468 --> 05:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
if this child is in danger not to
 
05:56:04.948 --> 05:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
determine if this adult calling in has a
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
bad intent knows something's false is
 
05:56:10.270 --> 05:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
reckless or or whatever other standard
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
you want to put in there that's simply
 
05:56:14.310 --> 05:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
not their job so whose job is it who's
 
05:56:17.310 --> 05:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
going to be determining if this is false
 
05:56:20.270 --> 05:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
if this is malicious um a similar issue
 
05:56:22.990 --> 05:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
exists with the penalties against a
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
professional reporter which um I don't
 
05:56:28.070 --> 05:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
believe that 169 c29 defines
 
05:56:29.788 --> 05:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
professional reporter it has a laundry
 
05:56:31.070 --> 05:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
list of
 
05:56:33.948 --> 05:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
professions so that's another issue but
 
05:56:38.510 --> 05:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
regardless um for a professional of any
 
05:56:40.350 --> 05:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
sort to be held to a
 
05:56:43.708 --> 05:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
standard regarding a failure to report
 
05:56:45.708 --> 05:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
something it's it's like proving a
 
05:56:47.868 --> 05:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
negative who who's going to go out there
 
05:56:50.590 --> 05:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
and find these people that allegedly
 
05:56:53.270 --> 05:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
failed to report something that they may
 
05:56:56.110 --> 05:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
have known um it's it's not really a
 
05:56:58.110 --> 05:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
standard that can be proven I'm not sure
 
05:57:01.628 --> 05:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
who would be doing that um and it really
 
05:57:03.070 --> 05:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
having these civil and criminal
 
05:57:06.150 --> 05:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
penalties opens the door to I believe
 
05:57:07.670 --> 05:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
someone already said sort of the flip
 
05:57:11.230 --> 05:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
side of threats of I'm going to now go
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
Civ sue you for maliciously reporting me
 
05:57:15.670 --> 05:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
because we're having a neighbor dispute
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
or we're having a very contentious
 
05:57:19.350 --> 05:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
divorce or this is a domestic violence
 
05:57:21.430 --> 05:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
situation I think in particular the
 
05:57:24.750 --> 05:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
Civil penalties really opens the door to
 
05:57:27.750 --> 05:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of unnecessary and malicious
 
05:57:30.468 --> 05:57:30.478 align:start position:0%
litigation and again it's incredibly
 
05:57:32.350 --> 05:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
difficult to improve to prove what
 
05:57:34.910 --> 05:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
intent somebody made a phone call with
 
05:57:36.990 --> 05:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
um so for all those reasons and again
 
05:57:38.750 --> 05:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
this anyone that sat here last year
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
probably heard me say the same thing on
 
05:57:44.030 --> 05:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
HB 1111 um the the wording of this bill
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
is problematic I know you've discussed a
 
05:57:49.750 --> 05:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
couple other states um you know
 
05:57:51.948 --> 05:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for this and perhaps looking
 
05:57:53.830 --> 05:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
at those might be more helpful but
 
05:57:56.110 --> 05:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
generally the office of child advocate
 
05:57:59.110 --> 05:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
does not support putting constraints
 
05:58:02.150 --> 05:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
around reporting our reporting law is
 
05:58:06.150 --> 05:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
purposely very Broad and very sweeping
 
05:58:08.230 --> 05:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
in order to get the most number of
 
05:58:10.670 --> 05:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
reports to protect children because we
 
05:58:12.468 --> 05:58:12.478 align:start position:0%
can tell you the office of the child
 
05:58:14.830 --> 05:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
Advocates re uh receives what something
 
05:58:17.190 --> 05:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
called um critical incident reports
 
05:58:19.430 --> 05:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
which are reports of child deaths parent
 
05:58:21.788 --> 05:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
deaths severe um cases of abuse and
 
05:58:25.190 --> 05:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
neglect and typically those um cirs that
 
05:58:28.830 --> 05:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
we receive there are numerous sometimes
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
up to two dozen screened out reports for
 
05:58:35.070 --> 05:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
those families numerous investigations
 
05:58:36.910 --> 05:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
that were unfounded
 
05:58:39.230 --> 05:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
and then in fact in the end the child is
 
05:58:43.350 --> 05:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
Gravely injured or dead um so again our
 
05:58:46.510 --> 05:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
process is not perfect but we already
 
05:58:49.990 --> 05:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
see instances where kids are falling
 
05:58:51.468 --> 05:58:51.478 align:start position:0%
through the gaps and bad things are
 
05:58:53.590 --> 05:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
happening we would hate to see any
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
further constraints on people feeling
 
05:58:58.070 --> 05:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
like they can make calls should make
 
05:59:00.350 --> 05:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
calls we do have a very extensive know
 
05:59:03.230 --> 05:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
and tell training for teachers and other
 
05:59:05.548 --> 05:59:05.558 align:start position:0%
um professional reporters which is not
 
05:59:08.670 --> 05:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
defined um that really encourages people
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
if your gut is telling you something's
 
05:59:15.830 --> 05:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
going on your job is to call dcf's job
 
05:59:18.548 --> 05:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
is to investigate and determine not your
 
05:59:20.830 --> 05:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
job that's not your job normal citizens
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
even professional reporters we have
 
05:59:25.190 --> 05:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
trained professionals who generally do a
 
05:59:27.750 --> 05:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
very good job and that's their job so
 
05:59:30.110 --> 05:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
let dcyf do their job once they get that
 
05:59:32.830 --> 05:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
call to screen it in or investigate it
 
05:59:34.990 --> 05:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
um don't put that burden on the general
 
05:59:42.590 --> 05:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:46.590 --> 05:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none seeing
 
05:59:50.070 --> 05:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
one representative cidel thank you Mr
 
05:59:51.750 --> 05:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess you're the one this
 
05:59:53.830 --> 05:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
year that I'm going to miss the hand of
 
05:59:53.840 --> 05:59:54.590 align:start position:0%
year that I'm going to miss the hand of
was

05:59:54.590 --> 05:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:59:56.788 --> 05:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
representative before I think you've
 
05:59:59.750 --> 05:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
practiced looking at me a lot now I did
 
06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
a lot muscle memory yeah that's what it
 
06:00:04.948 --> 06:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
is you need to wear brighter
 
06:00:06.830 --> 06:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
colors than
 
06:00:09.948 --> 06:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question um
 
06:00:11.830 --> 06:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
one of the comments you recently made
 
06:00:13.750 --> 06:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
was there's still kids falling through
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
the gaps and I'm what I'm hearing a lot
 
06:00:19.270 --> 06:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
in in present people that are presenting
 
06:00:22.110 --> 06:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
against this bill is the concern for the
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
reporter more than the concern for the
 
06:00:28.948 --> 06:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
child so my my concern is if we're
 
06:00:30.708 --> 06:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
allowing all these people to maliciously
 
06:00:32.750 --> 06:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
report without knowing and and whoever
 
06:00:34.390 --> 06:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be determining whether it's
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
malicious or not there are actual cases
 
06:00:39.548 --> 06:00:39.558 align:start position:0%
going on kid children that are being
 
06:00:42.110 --> 06:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
abused and they can't be followed
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
because we're following all these false
 
06:00:47.230 --> 06:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
reports that we have no penalty on so
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
could you explain how we can minimize
 
06:00:52.230 --> 06:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
the false reports without having
 
06:00:53.868 --> 06:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
something in
 
06:00:56.030 --> 06:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you I I appreciate
 
06:00:58.990 --> 06:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
your question you're right behind
 
06:01:05.310 --> 06:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
the um so again I am not sure that there
 
06:01:07.708 --> 06:01:07.718 align:start position:0%
are a great number of false reports
 
06:01:10.150 --> 06:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
testimony last year from the DCF
 
06:01:12.190 --> 06:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
director was that there aren't a lot of
 
06:01:13.948 --> 06:01:13.958 align:start position:0%
false reports they don't feel like it's
 
06:01:17.270 --> 06:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
an issue um I certainly wouldn't testify
 
06:01:19.230 --> 06:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
to whether or not there are malicious
 
06:01:22.110 --> 06:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
reports or how many I believe the
 
06:01:25.070 --> 06:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
current screening process screens out at
 
06:01:27.150 --> 06:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
least this was a testimony of the dcyf
 
06:01:30.150 --> 06:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
director last year and we we don't hear
 
06:01:33.510 --> 06:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise that um and again I won't say
 
06:01:35.948 --> 06:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
what's false because it might not be
 
06:01:37.548 --> 06:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
correct but that doesn't mean the person
 
06:01:39.948 --> 06:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
calling is making a false report they
 
06:01:40.788 --> 06:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:01:42.990 --> 06:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
concern they should call their concern
 
06:01:44.910 --> 06:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
into the professional to assess there
 
06:01:47.510 --> 06:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
are many many reports that are screened
 
06:01:49.708 --> 06:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
out which means it never even makes it
 
06:01:51.628 --> 06:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
to an assessment many
 
06:01:54.150 --> 06:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
reports once a report makes it to an
 
06:01:55.510 --> 06:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
assessment that's where it's being
 
06:01:57.030 --> 06:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
determined whether it's founded or
 
06:01:59.670 --> 06:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
unfounded but again a lot of the cases
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
most serious cases we see there are
 
06:02:03.670 --> 06:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
dozens of screened out reports so
 
06:02:05.310 --> 06:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
nothing ever happened that family was
 
06:02:06.350 --> 06:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
never even
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
notified that there was a a call um so
 
06:02:12.910 --> 06:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
from our experience at the OCA that's
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
not a problem we are hearing about it
 
06:02:17.270 --> 06:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
from the testimony last year it didn't
 
06:02:19.510 --> 06:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
seem like it was a big issue that the
 
06:02:22.030 --> 06:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
the division was concerned about there
 
06:02:23.868 --> 06:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
Central intake is doing their job to
 
06:02:26.430 --> 06:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
screen in or out reports appropriately
 
06:02:29.548 --> 06:02:29.558 align:start position:0%
and then conduct investigations and
 
06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
again the OCA really is most concerned
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
about the kids because we would rather
 
06:02:35.040 --> 06:02:36.830 align:start position:0%
about the kids because we would rather
see

06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:02:38.708 --> 06:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
too many reports made that maybe are
 
06:02:41.628 --> 06:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
screened out but one more investigation
 
06:02:43.230 --> 06:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
that protects a child that may have been
 
06:02:45.910 --> 06:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
engraved danger is really enough for us
 
06:02:48.150 --> 06:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
to to feel that it's important for that
 
06:02:52.110 --> 06:02:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:55.350 --> 06:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
made representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
06:02:57.788 --> 06:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you attorney masio
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you said about um
 
06:03:03.830 --> 06:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
what happens if if dcyf thinks it's a
 
06:03:06.708 --> 06:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
malicious report me think of a question
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
about what happens when they think that
 
06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
and so I I almost think it's a question
 
06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
for DCF and not necessarily you but my
 
06:03:17.310 --> 06:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
question is if the worker whether it's
 
06:03:19.830 --> 06:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
at Central intake or you know out on the
 
06:03:22.190 --> 06:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
on the ground thinks that someone has
 
06:03:24.510 --> 06:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
made a false report in order to harm
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
someone else what do they do with that
 
06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
information if this bill is
 
06:03:33.390 --> 06:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
passed my friend Susan laraby may want
 
06:03:36.910 --> 06:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
to come join me so um sorry Mr chairman
 
06:03:38.548 --> 06:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
I didn't think of it until she said that
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
and then okay now well and I can tell
 
06:03:42.670 --> 06:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
you I was a dcyf attorney for several
 
06:03:44.510 --> 06:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
years I was also a parent side attorney
 
06:03:46.590 --> 06:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
I was also a private family law attorney
 
06:03:48.270 --> 06:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
handling many of those terribly
 
06:03:50.510 --> 06:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
contentious divorces I think attorney
 
06:03:53.788 --> 06:03:53.798 align:start position:0%
larby said earlier uh they do become
 
06:03:55.190 --> 06:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with these sort of frequent
 
06:03:58.350 --> 06:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
flyers of contentious divorce cases um
 
06:03:59.830 --> 06:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
where calls are being made on each other
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
and often I can tell you the division
 
06:04:04.510 --> 06:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
will be subpoena into some of those
 
06:04:08.230 --> 06:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
divorce cases to testify about because
 
06:04:09.548 --> 06:04:09.558 align:start position:0%
often there's reports flying back and
 
06:04:14.270 --> 06:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
forth um so I I will defer to to many of
 
06:04:16.628 --> 06:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
those myself yes so I mean there are
 
06:04:18.830 --> 06:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms as well where like in a
 
06:04:21.070 --> 06:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
highly contentious divorce case which is
 
06:04:23.708 --> 06:04:23.718 align:start position:0%
an INF Family Division but under 461a
 
06:04:26.510 --> 06:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
not 169c one or the other parent will
 
06:04:28.190 --> 06:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
actually subpoena dcy have to come
 
06:04:30.590 --> 06:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
testify about how terrible the other
 
06:04:33.350 --> 06:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
parent is so those are handled in
 
06:04:35.310 --> 06:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
multiple Arenas but I will defer to
 
06:04:38.190 --> 06:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
Susan if she has some data thank thank
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
you addressing the first question so it
 
06:04:44.590 --> 06:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
has always been our belief that 169
 
06:04:47.628 --> 06:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
c39 covers both false reporting and
 
06:04:49.910 --> 06:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
failure to report when it says anyone
 
06:04:54.390 --> 06:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
who knowingly violates any section of
 
06:04:57.670 --> 06:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
169c is guilty of a misdemeanor and
 
06:05:00.030 --> 06:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
again putting on my prior hat as a
 
06:05:02.948 --> 06:05:02.958 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and you had asked uh attorney
 
06:05:04.990 --> 06:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
masot to asked well how does that happen
 
06:05:07.230 --> 06:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
that the report happens all the time
 
06:05:09.590 --> 06:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
especially in my old world where kiddo
 
06:05:11.070 --> 06:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
would be interviewed at the Child
 
06:05:14.110 --> 06:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
Advocacy Center and would say oh I
 
06:05:18.110 --> 06:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
disclosed this last year to my teacher
 
06:05:20.830 --> 06:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
and my teacher never well we learned the
 
06:05:22.830 --> 06:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
teacher never reported or something like
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
that that would lead to a prosecution of
 
06:05:28.670 --> 06:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
failure to report and absolutely we are
 
06:05:31.750 --> 06:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
not criminal prosecutors at dcyf and in
 
06:05:33.868 --> 06:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
fact we we are busy enough uh
 
06:05:35.670 --> 06:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
investigating abuse and neglect of
 
06:05:38.270 --> 06:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
kiddos if we believed that there was a
 
06:05:42.468 --> 06:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
knowingly false report made to DCF we
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
would refer that to law enforcement it's
 
06:05:46.590 --> 06:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and prosecutors who are
 
06:05:50.310 --> 06:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting criminal offenses not
 
06:05:53.390 --> 06:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
DCF once more yes yeah follow up so that
 
06:05:55.310 --> 06:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
follow is that the current practice the
 
06:05:58.190 --> 06:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
current practice is that if at a child
 
06:06:00.670 --> 06:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
advocacy at a yeah Child Advocacy Center
 
06:06:03.310 --> 06:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
interview or even a worker who's gotten
 
06:06:06.150 --> 06:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
seven reports and they're all nothing
 
06:06:07.510 --> 06:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
is the current practice that they would
 
06:06:09.030 --> 06:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
bring it to their supervisor and the
 
06:06:11.628 --> 06:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
supervisor would contact the police or
 
06:06:14.270 --> 06:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
it just they just say too
 
06:06:17.070 --> 06:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
bad if we ever believe that there is a
 
06:06:18.868 --> 06:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
crime that has been committed whether it
 
06:06:22.310 --> 06:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
be failure to report or or a false
 
06:06:24.110 --> 06:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
report to law enforcement yes we would
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
refer that to law enforcement and
 
06:06:28.948 --> 06:06:28.958 align:start position:0%
majority of our cases are involv a joint
 
06:06:31.070 --> 06:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
investigation right so anytime that we
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
believe that a child has not only been a
 
06:06:36.230 --> 06:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
victim of abuse and neglect
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
also could be a victim of a crime we
 
06:06:41.910 --> 06:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
report that to law enforcement and we do
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
what's called a joint investigation with
 
06:06:47.230 --> 06:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement so for instance at a CAC
 
06:06:48.670 --> 06:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
for the most part I don't know the
 
06:06:51.390 --> 06:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
percentages but majority of our cases
 
06:06:54.030 --> 06:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
the dcyf worker the law enforcement and
 
06:06:56.670 --> 06:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor are all at the table of
 
06:06:58.590 --> 06:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
that CAC interview hearing the
 
06:07:00.190 --> 06:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
information at the same
 
06:07:03.430 --> 06:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
time last follow one more so if this
 
06:07:05.948 --> 06:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
were Bill were to pass with some of the
 
06:07:08.270 --> 06:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
changes that the chairman has suggested
 
06:07:10.230 --> 06:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
would it change the practice in the
 
06:07:12.390 --> 06:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
offices at
 
06:07:15.430 --> 06:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
all it would not change current practice
 
06:07:18.030 --> 06:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
we are we are currently uh asking for
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
information that first part that says we
 
06:07:22.548 --> 06:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
may uh gather information about the
 
06:07:24.590 --> 06:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
personal identifiable information from
 
06:07:27.150 --> 06:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
the reporter we're already getting that
 
06:07:29.310 --> 06:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
we I explained earlier how helpful and
 
06:07:31.948 --> 06:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
how needed is to have that information
 
06:07:34.230 --> 06:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
from the caller and then again if we
 
06:07:38.390 --> 06:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
believe that 16 9 c39 has been violated
 
06:07:40.548 --> 06:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
we would we would refer that to law
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement if they haven't already
 
06:07:48.110 --> 06:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:50.590 --> 06:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
investigation thank you okay thank you
 
06:07:52.510 --> 06:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
councilors uh chair would like to
 
06:07:54.230 --> 06:07:54.240 align:start position:0%

Shay thank you we look forward to coming
 
06:07:58.190 --> 06:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
to tell you more about the
 
06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:05.708 --> 06:08:05.718 align:start position:0%
day right thank you Mr chairman thank

Katherine Shay gtown mother of two sets
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
of teenage twins
 
06:08:15.628 --> 06:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
now happy to say I've
 
06:08:19.990 --> 06:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
survived driving they're two years apart
 
06:08:21.230 --> 06:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
so and I think you heard two sets of
 
06:08:23.070 --> 06:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
twins earlier so thanks for hearing me
 
06:08:24.150 --> 06:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
today I'll keep it short because I have
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
to get to the DMV for my license and why
 
06:08:27.548 --> 06:08:27.558 align:start position:0%
am I here today good question because
 
06:08:30.390 --> 06:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's my birthday so
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
um I feel this is so important to be
 
06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
here and I don't just represent myself
 
06:08:37.070 --> 06:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
when I I come here to conquer I try to
 
06:08:39.270 --> 06:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
come as a volunteer to represent other
 
06:08:41.548 --> 06:08:41.558 align:start position:0%
people that can't be here other divorced
 
06:08:43.750 --> 06:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
parents other uh parents of special
 
06:08:45.788 --> 06:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
needs kids like myself I have three
 
06:08:46.868 --> 06:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
they're on the
 
06:08:50.708 --> 06:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
Spectrum and as a profession I do
 
06:08:52.708 --> 06:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
process re-engineering uh I'm a
 
06:08:54.670 --> 06:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
specialist in it I'm a IT program
 
06:08:57.270 --> 06:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
manager this is my thing but today I
 
06:08:58.708 --> 06:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to be here about process
 
06:09:00.070 --> 06:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we could go on all day long
 
06:09:01.990 --> 06:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
about process and there's holes in it
 
06:09:03.750 --> 06:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
and there's you know needs better
 
06:09:05.070 --> 06:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
filtering that's kind of a separate
 
06:09:06.788 --> 06:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
topic you know like whatever their
 
06:09:08.708 --> 06:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
process needs to change to be to be
 
06:09:10.788 --> 06:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
better is also something good to think
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
about but for today I really want to
 
06:09:16.230 --> 06:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
talk about the Crux of this which is
 
06:09:18.270 --> 06:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
dishonesty and when I was a kid growing
 
06:09:20.150 --> 06:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
up we were taught not to lie we were
 
06:09:21.670 --> 06:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
taught there were consequences for lying
 
06:09:22.868 --> 06:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
we were taught that if you told a lie
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell another lie and
 
06:09:25.830 --> 06:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
another lie to cover it up and there are
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
real consequences for those things I
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
heard somebody said earlier
 
06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um you know whose job is
 
06:09:36.948 --> 06:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
it somebody said unfounded does not mean
 
06:09:39.990 --> 06:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
false well if it's unfounded and
 
06:09:42.628 --> 06:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
someone's out overtly lying you know so
 
06:09:44.070 --> 06:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
where's the repercussions for that
 
06:09:45.628 --> 06:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
person and it's not just one person
 
06:09:48.150 --> 06:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about multiple people so
 
06:09:50.150 --> 06:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the case of my family the nightmare
 
06:09:53.590 --> 06:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
began 10 years ago and I'm brittle and
 
06:09:55.430 --> 06:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
getting old because of all of these
 
06:09:57.110 --> 06:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
things that happened to our family
 
06:09:59.390 --> 06:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
literally affected me physically
 
06:10:01.830 --> 06:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
mentally in every possible way was
 
06:10:03.990 --> 06:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive requiring me to hire
 
06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
a second lawyer during a six-year
 
06:10:07.708 --> 06:10:07.718 align:start position:0%
Marathon family law divorce with a
 
06:10:11.230 --> 06:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
crappy gal and I had to pay $300 more an
 
06:10:12.788 --> 06:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
hour out of pocket for someone else just
 
06:10:15.868 --> 06:10:15.878 align:start position:0%
to protect our family and there was no
 
06:10:17.868 --> 06:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
going to the police the police weren't
 
06:10:18.990 --> 06:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
going to do anything there's no law in
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
place about this if you file a false a
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
police report you're going to hear from
 
06:10:24.548 --> 06:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
the police about that so this
 
06:10:26.110 --> 06:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
perpetrator and I'm happy to send you a
 
06:10:28.110 --> 06:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
diagram that I've testified on year
 
06:10:29.868 --> 06:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
after year after year about
 
06:10:33.830 --> 06:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
this engineered 12 to 20 people to all
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
maliciously attack right of the gates
 
06:10:37.628 --> 06:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
thinking that would give them an upper
 
06:10:40.948 --> 06:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
hand in a divorce and that had such a
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
ripple through effect it turned you know
 
06:10:46.708 --> 06:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
the reputation upside down even if it's
 
06:10:49.868 --> 06:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
unfounded the damage is done right and
 
06:10:51.948 --> 06:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
we heard unfounded doesn't mean false so
 
06:10:53.230 --> 06:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
what do you think that puts in the minds
 
06:10:56.948 --> 06:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
of people around you co-workers
 
06:10:59.868 --> 06:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
neighbors school officials when you're
 
06:11:01.468 --> 06:11:01.478 align:start position:0%
trying to advocate for your kids to have
 
06:11:02.830 --> 06:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
an IEP and just to get a free and
 
06:11:04.788 --> 06:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate education and so somebody
 
06:11:07.070 --> 06:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
thinks it's funny or cool to get back at
 
06:11:09.150 --> 06:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
you and call something in false or to
 
06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
actually collude with your ex-husband
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
and get in on it together 12 to 20
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
people all made false complaints many of
 
06:11:19.150 --> 06:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
them did know you could do anonymously
 
06:11:20.948 --> 06:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
and they chose to do that in many cases
 
06:11:22.948 --> 06:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
hiding behind a therapist even in one
 
06:11:25.468 --> 06:11:25.478 align:start position:0%
case where it was a girlfriend's two she
 
06:11:27.510 --> 06:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
called her two daughters called the
 
06:11:29.708 --> 06:11:29.718 align:start position:0%
therapist called and they get layers of
 
06:11:31.628 --> 06:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
protection meanwhile I'm out there in
 
06:11:34.708 --> 06:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
the open exposed working my you know
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
tail off trying to keep my household
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
going keep my kids educated fed and
 
06:11:40.990 --> 06:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
everybody happy and the cost of that
 
06:11:43.830 --> 06:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
almost cost my son a very serious
 
06:11:45.270 --> 06:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
medical condition where we were on the
 
06:11:47.788 --> 06:11:47.798 align:start position:0%
verge of needing expert help meanwhile
 
06:11:49.150 --> 06:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
these are coming in and I'm in a
 
06:11:51.548 --> 06:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
hospital room with a kid with a brain
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
condition can you imagine how that feels
 
06:11:56.390 --> 06:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
to somebody the Injustice can never be
 
06:11:58.110 --> 06:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
made right it's a lot like if you ever
 
06:12:00.310 --> 06:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
read The Scarlet Letter and you walk
 
06:12:01.948 --> 06:12:01.958 align:start position:0%
around you remember Hester pran in the
 
06:12:04.030 --> 06:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
story of the Scarlet lad she had that
 
06:12:05.830 --> 06:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
emblazoned on her
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
permanently and so this is not about
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
process this is not about civil remedy
 
06:12:13.708 --> 06:12:13.718 align:start position:0%
this is we have a loophole and that
 
06:12:16.350 --> 06:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
loophole is causing people to be really
 
06:12:19.150 --> 06:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
harmed and I'm a caseing in point about
 
06:12:21.270 --> 06:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm literally falling apart now I
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
have medical issues and all kinds of
 
06:12:24.830 --> 06:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
stuff it's because I couldn't take care
 
06:12:26.948 --> 06:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
of myself because I had to pay for
 
06:12:29.468 --> 06:12:29.478 align:start position:0%
lawyers meanwhile that person walks
 
06:12:31.830 --> 06:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
scot-free and can still think they can
 
06:12:34.590 --> 06:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
do that and there was no stopping this
 
06:12:37.590 --> 06:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
person there was no filter up front all
 
06:12:40.150 --> 06:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
of them were sent right through and
 
06:12:42.070 --> 06:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
every time actually at the end they
 
06:12:44.430 --> 06:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
actually did say you know Mr I'm not
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to say the name we're starting to
 
06:12:47.868 --> 06:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
catch on a little but every time you say
 
06:12:49.510 --> 06:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
something these things never end up
 
06:12:52.750 --> 06:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
being true but there's no consequence so
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
10 years of harm has ruined the best
 
06:12:58.030 --> 06:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
years of my life it ruins a lot of other
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
people's lives it's not just and I ask
 
06:13:02.868 --> 06:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
you to do something about that and make
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
something happen this year this bill has
 
06:13:07.030 --> 06:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
really good Merit it's made it very far
 
06:13:09.510 --> 06:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
many times and we don't want the Senate
 
06:13:11.390 --> 06:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
to kill it like happened last year
 
06:13:13.948 --> 06:13:13.958 align:start position:0%
please pass something help people I'm
 
06:13:16.070 --> 06:13:16.080 align:start position:0%

06:13:33.230 --> 06:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:43.708 --> 06:13:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:46.110 --> 06:13:46.120 align:start position:0%

please um I uh I own three businesses I
 
06:14:05.548 --> 06:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
have a daughter that's seven um I have
 
06:14:09.548 --> 06:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
about four to eight uh dcyf cases
 
06:14:12.628 --> 06:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
against me um I have my daughter
 
06:14:17.788 --> 06:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
full-time right now uh my uh ex-wife is
 
06:14:20.110 --> 06:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh has supervised visitation with her
 
06:14:23.868 --> 06:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
now uh but to get to this point uh me
 
06:14:28.230 --> 06:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
and my family uh was her uh support
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
system uh since she was born and through
 
06:14:32.000 --> 06:14:32.750 align:start position:0%
system uh since she was born and through
my

06:14:32.750 --> 06:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:14:35.868 --> 06:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
divorce um
 
06:14:39.230 --> 06:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
it was weaponized against me as well as
 
06:14:41.310 --> 06:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure other it's happened to many
 
06:14:44.270 --> 06:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
others it sound sound like I luckily had
 
06:14:48.070 --> 06:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
family that helped me get through it um
 
06:14:52.910 --> 06:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of lawyer fees um um I had to I
 
06:14:54.830 --> 06:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
had to I had to get a lawyer that really
 
06:14:57.468 --> 06:14:57.478 align:start position:0%
had to help me through this process and
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
the worst case about it was uh I felt it
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
was I was uh um guilty until proven
 
06:15:08.750 --> 06:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
innocence but the damaging aspect of
 
06:15:10.270 --> 06:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
this was the fact that my daughter was
 
06:15:13.510 --> 06:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
taken away from me overnight when I was
 
06:15:16.110 --> 06:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
t uh I picked her off on the bus dropped
 
06:15:18.948 --> 06:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
off on the bus uh took her to karate
 
06:15:21.150 --> 06:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
took her to everything I was the support
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
for the family my ex-wife did not walk
 
06:15:28.750 --> 06:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
and she utilized it with her lawyer to
 
06:15:32.990 --> 06:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
um prolong the inevitable of trying to
 
06:15:36.270 --> 06:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
just destroy my life and take my family
 
06:15:39.868 --> 06:15:39.878 align:start position:0%
down and I typically am not someone that
 
06:15:41.590 --> 06:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
comes out and just talks in front of
 
06:15:45.070 --> 06:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
people um so I don't know I'm kind of
 
06:15:51.230 --> 06:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
flying here um but you know I'm lucky
 
06:15:52.830 --> 06:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to let everybody know
 
06:15:54.910 --> 06:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
that there's many men that are not as
 
06:15:57.788 --> 06:15:57.798 align:start position:0%
lucky as I am or grateful to have family
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
that was able to support help me through
 
06:16:03.750 --> 06:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
the process and help me Shield my
 
06:16:05.708 --> 06:16:05.718 align:start position:0%
daughter through the process process and
 
06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
when I talk about that the difficult
 
06:16:10.070 --> 06:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
thing when I was taken
 
06:16:10.080 --> 06:16:11.750 align:start position:0%
thing when I was taken
away

06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
away
 
06:16:17.150 --> 06:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
she was with someone that was not
 
06:16:20.910 --> 06:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
well she thought that she could not uh
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
she thought she was allergic to the sun
 
06:16:27.190 --> 06:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of it was a it
 
06:16:30.110 --> 06:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
was it was a good it was it was a long
 
06:16:30.120 --> 06:16:32.030 align:start position:0%
was it was a good it was it was a long
process

06:16:32.030 --> 06:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:16:36.548 --> 06:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
um but I'm very intrigued by this Bild
 
06:16:39.350 --> 06:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
just because I did go through the
 
06:16:42.868 --> 06:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
dcyf process I've talked um to three or
 
06:16:45.990 --> 06:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
four because I had about four or five
 
06:16:50.468 --> 06:16:50.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:54.150 --> 06:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
and Justice did come through I'm just
 
06:16:56.948 --> 06:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
saying it did because I was patient and
 
06:16:59.468 --> 06:16:59.478 align:start position:0%
I and I and I walked the line and I
 
06:17:00.788 --> 06:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
followed the
 
06:17:04.390 --> 06:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
instructions uh to the T for my daughter
 
06:17:10.750 --> 06:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
um that said um it came out of uh uh my
 
06:17:14.510 --> 06:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
daughter's inheritance her her her time
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
um with me trying able to even get my
 
06:17:22.990 --> 06:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:25.310 --> 06:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm jumping all over the place
 
06:17:27.270 --> 06:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
because it was literally a long like a
 
06:17:28.350 --> 06:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
year of
 
06:17:33.030 --> 06:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
chaos and nothing ever is
 
06:17:37.110 --> 06:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
resolved in terms of of it happened it's
 
06:17:39.990 --> 06:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
done my daughter is now with
 
06:17:42.270 --> 06:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
me but
 
06:17:45.868 --> 06:17:45.878 align:start position:0%
my but the person that just continued to
 
06:17:49.390 --> 06:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
attack is able to still do
 
06:17:53.788 --> 06:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:57.510 --> 06:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
um when you're someone that goes through
 
06:17:57.520 --> 06:17:59.310 align:start position:0%
um when you're someone that goes through
that

06:17:59.310 --> 06:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
um it makes you feel as well as you know
 
06:18:05.310 --> 06:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
you always unshown
 
06:18:09.910 --> 06:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
Edge um because you don't know when
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen
 
06:18:11.520 --> 06:18:13.990 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen
again

06:18:13.990 --> 06:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:18:17.830 --> 06:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean any questions I've been
 
06:18:18.990 --> 06:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
through it
 
06:18:22.628 --> 06:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
hard and um I've been very transparent
 
06:18:25.070 --> 06:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
through my family through my friends
 
06:18:27.270 --> 06:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
through my colleagues again I own three

other officers uh they interviewed the
 
06:23:20.350 --> 06:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
DCF um case worker
 
06:23:23.750 --> 06:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
Paula Paula told him what was going on
 
06:23:26.548 --> 06:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh at one point she even stipulated that
 
06:23:30.030 --> 06:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
she had a conversation with Shelby that
 
06:23:32.750 --> 06:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh Shelby was was angry that uh her
 
06:23:34.150 --> 06:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
mother was getting the benefits for the
 
06:23:37.030 --> 06:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
kids Paula took the told her and says
 
06:23:38.430 --> 06:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
tried to explain to her and reason her
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
hey look she legally can get those
 
06:23:42.788 --> 06:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
benefits those benefits aren't for her
 
06:23:44.430 --> 06:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
they're for the girls you'll get them
 
06:23:47.430 --> 06:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
back once you get reunification it
 
06:23:49.590 --> 06:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't good enough for for Shelby and
 
06:23:52.030 --> 06:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the police report she
 
06:23:55.230 --> 06:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
specifically told the casew worker in
 
06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
the police report that I want my mother
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
to suffer
 
06:24:01.910 --> 06:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
consequences now with that in
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
mind she stopped uh letting Stacy see
 
06:24:06.990 --> 06:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
the kids after reunification so we had
 
06:24:09.270 --> 06:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
to file grandparents visitation 18
 
06:24:11.788 --> 06:24:11.798 align:start position:0%
months we went through that and we still
 
06:24:14.670 --> 06:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
the judge kooper was really uh uh
 
06:24:16.468 --> 06:24:16.478 align:start position:0%
respectful about things he didn't find
 
06:24:19.030 --> 06:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
that Shelby's testimony and evidence was
 
06:24:21.788 --> 06:24:21.798 align:start position:0%
credible so he he says hey you guys can
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
have grandparents visitation here's the
 
06:24:26.788 --> 06:24:26.798 align:start position:0%
set schedule here's the court order they
 
06:24:28.190 --> 06:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
were concerned Shelby was going to be in
 
06:24:31.150 --> 06:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
contempt and not honor true to form she
 
06:24:33.990 --> 06:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
didn't she didn't honor it and when
 
06:24:35.548 --> 06:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
going to the court system when you file
 
06:24:37.430 --> 06:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
for contempt it takes 3 months four
 
06:24:39.070 --> 06:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
months before you get in front of a
 
06:24:42.270 --> 06:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
judge um with that in mind we submitted
 
06:24:44.750 --> 06:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
the the police report to the judge to
 
06:24:47.548 --> 06:24:47.558 align:start position:0%
look at it uh they didn't do anything
 
06:24:49.788 --> 06:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
about it we had to get a transcript of
 
06:24:52.548 --> 06:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
there were some physical and uh verbal
 
06:24:53.868 --> 06:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
abuse in the waiting room of the
 
06:24:56.150 --> 06:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
courthouse the daughter going after
 
06:24:58.350 --> 06:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
Stacy we tried to get the video from
 
06:25:02.230 --> 06:25:02.240 align:start position:0%

06:25:03.708 --> 06:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
lot of these things were happening so
 
06:25:06.030 --> 06:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
when we asked the police when we asked
 
06:25:08.030 --> 06:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
the officer whitcom hey look we'd like
 
06:25:10.548 --> 06:25:10.558 align:start position:0%

06:25:13.310 --> 06:25:13.320 align:start position:0%

I think it's going through the it's
 
06:25:58.510 --> 06:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
going through the process can you see if
 
06:25:59.990 --> 06:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's been signed off or anything he goes
 
06:26:01.868 --> 06:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
let me let me check on it so about a
 
06:26:03.750 --> 06:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
week later he contacted he says no it's
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
nothing I said well what can we do it's
 
06:26:07.590 --> 06:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
a false report he is there's nothing you
 
06:26:11.230 --> 06:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
can do there's no there's no uh you know
 
06:26:13.628 --> 06:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
segue for us to do this there's no law
 
06:26:15.788 --> 06:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
that allows you to file a false police
 
06:26:18.830 --> 06:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
report for you know for child abuse and
 
06:26:20.150 --> 06:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
it was her daughter cuz her daughter was
 
06:26:21.708 --> 06:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
down her beaten on the desk and then she
 
06:26:24.390 --> 06:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
went down and after it was dismissed she
 
06:26:26.750 --> 06:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
went down and filed again with another
 
06:26:28.310 --> 06:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
set of charges and they were just
 
06:26:29.708 --> 06:26:29.718 align:start position:0%
getting tired of answering the phone at
 
06:26:30.830 --> 06:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
the police department when they would
 
06:26:32.910 --> 06:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
call she would identify who she was same
 
06:26:35.788 --> 06:26:35.798 align:start position:0%
voice they're like here we we go again
 
06:26:37.628 --> 06:26:37.638 align:start position:0%
so nothing has happened we don't have
 
06:26:40.030 --> 06:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
grandparents visitations uh because they
 
06:26:42.628 --> 06:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
came up with one particular law U you
 
06:26:44.708 --> 06:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
know something about the nuclear family
 
06:26:48.150 --> 06:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
is you know restricted uh for any reason
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and that's what her daughter
 
06:26:51.628 --> 06:26:51.638 align:start position:0%
did for whatever reason was you know
 
06:26:53.670 --> 06:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
whether you don't like the color shirt
 
06:26:56.830 --> 06:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
I'm wearing or the Sun or you know
 
06:26:58.310 --> 06:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
basically was because she didn't get the
 
06:27:00.230 --> 06:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
benefits she felt that she was screwed
 
06:27:02.548 --> 06:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
out of those benefits and she didn't
 
06:27:06.070 --> 06:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
want the girls around so I'm sorry
 
06:27:08.270 --> 06:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
I hate to do this that's fine because
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
you're on a roll and this really speaks
 
06:27:13.310 --> 06:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
to the bill but we are up against a St
 
06:27:14.868 --> 06:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
