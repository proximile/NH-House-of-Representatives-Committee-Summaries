all right about
 
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
those in favor of uh proving the rest of
 
00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 align:start position:0%
the consent agenda say I I opposed
 
00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
director tomorrow should we deal with
 
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
the off consent first or do you think
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
regular calendar first then because I
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
I believe the town Health officers was
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
on the consent agenda I don't was that
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
removed oh
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh the calendar I just got is okay oh
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
the immunization registry rules yes
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
that's a little different sorry excuse
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
me that's fine I just want to make sure
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
I didn't miss that one being removed
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so with regards to the immunization
 
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.070 align:start position:0%
um so with regards to the immunization
rules

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
that has not changed from the interim
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
rule that was filed last year as 2022 5.
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
the only reason it's on the regular
 
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
agenda is because there was a number of
 
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
comments on it when it was an interim
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
rule so we wanted to keep it on the
 
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
regular agenda and additionally there
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
were two notes to jail car on pages two
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
and three of the rules
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
regarding those forms that are mentioned
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
those forms are not being updated in
 
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
this particular rule but the department
 
00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
has stated that they're in the rule
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
making process
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
to update those along with other rules
 
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
in order to implement HB 1606 which I
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
believe becomes effective this summer
 
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.710 align:start position:0%
believe becomes effective this summer
okay

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
good morning Allison radmay
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
administrator of the administrative
 
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
rules unit for the Department of Health
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
um just as attorney Reichert had said
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
um we are moving forward with revisions
 
00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.090 align:start position:0%
um we are moving forward with revisions
to

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
Hep 307
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
307 and 301.
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
um to incorporate HB 1606 that does
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
become effective this summer we are
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
still in the heavy drafting stages
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
within the department but we do expect
 
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
to start rulemaking on that within the
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
next few weeks
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh so that I hope the intent is that
 
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
those forms are the updated forms are
 
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
available before the start of school
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or comments
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I have a
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
question about some of the wording on
 
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
the Forum I know it was approved
 
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
previously but it says that it's at a
 
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
request for a religious exemption
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
however in our statutes it's not a
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
request it's a it's a right
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
um and I'm concerned that stating it as
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
a request would lead to some some
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
facilities not accepting this religious
 
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
exemption that is under the please
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
specify the vaccines for which this
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
exemption applies on the New Hampshire
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
child care school immunization form or
 
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
not sure that I
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Ian Marie
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
McCurry I'm the immunization section
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
chief for the Department I'm happy to
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I'm sorry
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
representative Leon I'm not sure exactly
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
where you're specifying would you please
 
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.510 align:start position:0%
where you're specifying would you please
clarify

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you if you have the school
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
immunization form in front of you when
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
you look just above the check boxes for
 
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
the various vaccines it says on that
 
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
line your request for a religious
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
exemption a request implies that it can
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
be rejected
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
but the law says that if you have a
 
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:53.459 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
a child shall be exempt from
 
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
immunization if the parent signs this
 
00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:06.350 align:start position:0%
immunization if the parent signs this
form

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
may I ask is there a specific term that
 
00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
you would rather have in place
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
um I would just strike the words request
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
for religious exemption so it says it
 
00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:26.459 align:start position:0%
will not impact your religious exemption
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
because I appreciate those clarifying
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
words because they're a big concern
 
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
about those check boxes
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
Senator move to approve as edited okay
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
discussion to approve as edited
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.650 align:start position:0%
all in favor

okay thank you very much thank you
 
00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:57.829 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
um

00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
different ones
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
2022-191 is on Severance of connection
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
and changes of address
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
you'll see in front of you is a one-page
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
proposal it's pretty short the only
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
reason why it's not on consent is
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
because one of these rules has been
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
expired since May of last year and
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
that's on the section regarding changes
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
of address which
 
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
um you know requires that applicants or
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
licensees report changes of address
 
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
within 30 days time and that if mail is
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
returned back to the board for a wrong
 
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
address the the board will issue a
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
letter of concern like I said that's the
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
only issue is that the rules have been
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
good morning Tina Kelly
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
um office of professional licensure and
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
certification what the board did for
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
that section was relied on RSA 329 colon
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
16--f Roman numeral one which states
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
okay so what were any uh
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
doctors discipline for for not reporting
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
a change of address
 
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
I mean discussion
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
all right those in favor
 
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.750 align:start position:0%
all right those in favor
opposed

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
all right we have that one
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
so for this particular item 2022
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
9 the agency did file a conditional
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
approval which did address the majority
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
of the comments however there were still
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
some that remained and additionally some
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
new comments that were made because the
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
conditional approval included a
 
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.370 align:start position:0%
conditional approval included a
universal

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
universal
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
initial licensure form a universal
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
temporary license form Universal renewal
 
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
form and
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
form for the temporary active military
 
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
license applications which could
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
potentially conflict with boards that
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
already have forms for these particular
 
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.370 align:start position:0%
already have forms for these particular
license

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
so there was a note to jailcar on page
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
one about that
 
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
one about that
um

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
one of the remaining comments from the
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
FP is on page one it's an unclear note
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
to gel car comment as there seemed to be
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
some overlap between the language in
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
this in the particular section cited and
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
PLC 213 which is disciplinary
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
proceedings and license conditions
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
in the opleas summary of comments it is
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
represented that there is little overlap
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
between the two and that the oplc will
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
review what is currently in PLC 213 to
 
00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
see if anything should be moved to the
 
00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:09.910 align:start position:0%
see if anything should be moved to the
300s

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
300s
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
the next comment
 
00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:13.670 align:start position:0%
the next comment
um

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
is a unclear legislative intent common
 
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
on page two of the conditional approval
 
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.210 align:start position:0%
on page two of the conditional approval
text

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:22.220 align:start position:0%
text
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
they have at the very end of the
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
requirements essentially an
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing requirement that if
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
is not listed it will apply or need to
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
be submitted if it's not listed in what
 
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
they that may cause some issues because
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
they may be incorporating information
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
from third parties which would need a
 
00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:49.459 align:start position:0%
corporation by reference form
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
or they may require information that
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
cannot be incorporated by reference on
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
the form but actually has to be stated
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
in the rule text this comment is also
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
made for
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
um later in that section B8 and
 
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.730 align:start position:0%
um later in that section B8 and
additionally

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
um on page 25.
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
on page three of the final proposal and
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
on page one of the conditional approval
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
text there's another
 
00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:23.779 align:start position:0%
no-till GL car that the changed language
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
includes disclosure or personal
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
information for individuals and the
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
email address for legal entities
 
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.250 align:start position:0%
email address for legal entities
um

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:33.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
essentially what the agency is saying is
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
that the person or the entity if they do
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
not wish to disclose that information to
 
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
the public can indicate that on the form
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
however this may conflict with our say
 
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.790 align:start position:0%
however this may conflict with our say
91a

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
91a
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
should it go to a court the court would
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
Implement a balancing test on the
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
individual or the entity's right to
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
privacy over the public interest and at
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
this time it's staff's opinion that it
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
may be too encompassing or too much of
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
an overreach to deny the public that
 
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
an overreach to deny the public that
information

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
on page three of the conditional
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
approval text there is also
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
an unclear comment as there's a request
 
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
on the in the text for the verification
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
of licensures but it's not seen on the
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
form that was submitted to OLS
 
00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:32.459 align:start position:0%
and finally on page nine of the final
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
proposal text the form requires that the
 
00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:37.310 align:start position:0%
proposal text the form requires that the
applicant

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
applicant
 
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:37.970 align:start position:0%
applicant
um

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me the form that was submitted to
 
00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
OLS says that the requirement that is
 
00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
being asked for is for applicants of
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
repress a property only but it's not
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
clear in the rule text that that is the
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
case the rule text just says that that
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
information should be provided so there
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
is some discrepancy between the form and
 
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:08.339 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Lindsey
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
Courtney I'm the executive director of
 
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.389 align:start position:0%
Courtney I'm the executive director of
oplc

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
um just briefly I think uh kind of a
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
broad overview of what we're trying to
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
do here would address some of the
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
staff's comments
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
oplc has now has statutory authority
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
over licensing procedures and the boards
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
have statutory authority over licensing
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
criteria all of the boards previously
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
had statutory authority over procedures
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
and so they all had different forms
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
which has led to issues with respect to
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
data and how we're managing our system
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
so what we are trying to do is come up
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
with what we call a universal
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
application with respect to procedures
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
or basically everything that the boards
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
have on on their own applications in
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
different formats so I call that page
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
one and then page two will be whatever
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
the specific criteria is that relates to
 
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
that profession in order to make this
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
happen we need to have page one in place
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
first and then we need to go back and
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
modify page two to make sure that the
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
board forms are limited to criteria so
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
certainly there will be a conflict as
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
this committee has seen as oplc has
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
obtained additional legislative
 
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.669 align:start position:0%
obtained additional legislative
Authority

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:17.870 align:start position:0%
Authority
um

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's the only way that we think we can
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
actually manage it so that's with
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
respect to the first comment with
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
respect to the second comment in plc2
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh 213. the 200s deal with disciplinary
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
proceedings which are very different
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
from adjudicating licensing applications
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
we don't view it as a conflict
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
um the reason why this is important is
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
because in a licensing proceeding where
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
somebody does not have a license the
 
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
burden is on the applicant to
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate why they qualify for
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
licensure in a disciplinary proceeding
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
the burden is on the prosecutor to show
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
why the license should be there should
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
be conditions on the license so there's
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
two separate proceedings and they don't
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
view that as a conflict
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I think it was page 25 it's also on
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
page one with respect to disclosure of
 
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
personal information the Department of
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
Justice has taken the position and has
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
advised all agencies including ours that
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
email addresses are confidential and so
 
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.110 align:start position:0%
email addresses are confidential and so
therefore

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
we do not as a matter of course disclose
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
email addresses however it has been a
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
long-standing practice for many of our
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
boards to give out email addresses to
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
associations what we are trying to do is
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
allow individuals to consent and it we
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
believe that it's their right to consent
 
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
to disclosure of their private
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
information and if they choose to
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
consent to disclosure we would release
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
that information if they choose not to
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
disc consent a disclosure we would not
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
release that information
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
yes this is relevant to email addresses
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
only and not mail addresses
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
um they could consent under the proposed
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
isn't that Public public information is
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
there we've been advised that
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
um from our perspective doj has advised
 
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:09.419 align:start position:0%
us that personal mailing addresses are
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
confidential business mailing addresses
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
are not so we do give out business uh
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
mailing addresses but the problem is
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
going back to page one the boards have
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
collected this information in different
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
ways so we can't do a data export to
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
really provide that information in a
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
user accessible format so we'd like to
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
create a a scenario where we are
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
capturing both personal and business and
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
if individuals want to consent to
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
disclosure personal information for
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
specific question so please continue
 
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.450 align:start position:0%
specific question so please continue
okay

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
regarding the comment that
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
um oplc is requesting that individuals
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
submit basically any other documentation
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
that is otherwise required that goes
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
back to the page one versus page two we
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
cannot reasonably be expected to list
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
everything that any licensed
 
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
professional would ever be required to
 
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.289 align:start position:0%
professional would ever be required to
submit

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
submit
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
according to the board rules on this
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
page one application so what we're
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
saying is that you have to follow page
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
one and then you have to follow page two
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
whatever that may be
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
um and and unfortunately because we have
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
so many license types we can't list all
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
of those page twos and then finally with
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
respect to reciprocity only I would
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
agree with that comment that we can
 
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.140 align:start position:0%
certainly make that change
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
that the requirement to submit a
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
verification of licensure in another
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
state clearly only applies to those
 
00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:57.539 align:start position:0%
seeking licensure by endorsement or
 
00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:04.570 align:start position:0%
seeking licensure by endorsement or
reciprocity

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:04.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
granting a license by reciprocity you
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
you confirmed that the requirements from
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
that other state are substantially
 
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.150 align:start position:0%
that other state are substantially
similar

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh it depends on the statutory mechanism
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
under which uh the license is granted so
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
there are many different reciprocity
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
applications that we have for those and
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
I just did whip this with funeral the
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
other day uh for those who are seeking
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
licensure under 332gs analysis that
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
require substantial equivalency we do
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
require that the board make a
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
determination that the requirements are
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent before we issue
 
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
the license
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
um some boards already have in rules a
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
reciprocity based uh
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism for obtaining a license in the
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority for that is not 332g
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we follow that process
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay but in general you do verify that
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
they meet the minimum requirements oh
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely thank you I had
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
some some questions from people as to
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
whether that was the case so I wanted to
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:24.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
so along with the information that we're
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
that is collected on those people the
 
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
individuals licenses other social
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
security numbers I would think correct
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes it's a requirement of state law
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
which is incorporated uh incorporating
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
federal law which dates back to child
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
support obligations that we are required
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
to collect Social Security numbers on
 
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
all licensing applications
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
so how does one protect that information
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
when when people say you can do you can
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
just you know just you can distribute my
 
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.810 align:start position:0%
just you know just you can distribute my
information

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
how is it that just that that process is
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
selected and Social Security numbers
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
aren't sent flying around oh yes no
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very good question so um
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
if we're doing a data export we would
 
00:23:09.059 --> 00:23:10.370 align:start position:0%
if we're doing a data export we would
export

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
export
 
00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:12.539 align:start position:0%
um particular data fields that obviously
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
would not include Social Security
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
numbers and there's
 
00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
um we always have two people check the
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
data fields to make sure that they are
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
and you do have the uh
 
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
uh the option of individuals not
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
contending to share their data
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
we have the option of individuals not
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
consenting or yes if individuals don't
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
consent to disclosure of confidential
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
information we don't disclose that and
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have a mechanism for
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
people to consent so we aren't
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
disclosing anything which is actually
 
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
cause problems with some of our friends
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
um because they have always received
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
this data uh in the past so we'd like to
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
provide that opportunity for people to
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
consent but right now we're not we're
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
not disclosing anything now if it's
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
public information under 91a obviously
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
we we certainly do disclose that
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
information but that's typically name
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so in the past
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
some of the county Registries I think
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
all of them as a matter of fact
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
included Social Security numbers uh on
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
in their records and then a number of
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
them have gone online and that is there
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
and that stuff became searchable and it
 
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
became a problem because the social
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
security numbers are right out there in
 
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
the open I think most of them have taken
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
steps to uh to try to
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
stop that and I'm wondering whether your
 
00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:47.419 align:start position:0%
files any of them are searchable online
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
and thus you would have a similar
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
problem with them if you're requiring
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
the social security numbers
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
uh we do have an online system and duat
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
has fully vetted it um it's been online
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
for years you can search for individuals
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
licenses but Social Security is not the
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
data that's that's published
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you good to know other
 
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.450 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you good to know other
questions

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
right please continue
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
those are all my um comments in response
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
to staff comments
 
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.190 align:start position:0%
to staff comments
okay

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.299 --> 00:25:43.909 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm Sally fellows state
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative for Grafton 8.
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
um my first question has to do with the
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
use of the portal
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
to file an application it seems to be
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
the only option that's available
 
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
so my concern is that
 
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.090 align:start position:0%
so my concern is that
um

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people that might be
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
applying for a license that only have a
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
cell phone to use they don't have a
 
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.610 align:start position:0%
cell phone to use they don't have a
computer

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
computer
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
some of the applications require that
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
they write a narrative about their
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
experience and to try to do that on a
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
cell phone would be
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
really difficult plus I assume that you
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
want them to upload transcripts
 
00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
things like that and then they would
 
00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:33.539 align:start position:0%
need a printer with a scanner
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
so it appears to me from me from what I
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
saw in the proposed rules that you've
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
eliminated the paper option can you
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.570 align:start position:0%
address that
yes

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
um we presently only conduct renewals
 
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
online so for the large majority of our
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
200 and something thousand licensees
 
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
they're only renewing their license
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
online through the portal we have a
 
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.049 align:start position:0%
online through the portal we have a
kiosk

00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
kiosk
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and and people readily they typically
 
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
will make appointments with their staff
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll walk them through it as this
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
committee is aware we are currently
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
upgrading our system we'll be mobile
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
friendly so those individuals who have
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
cell phones will be able to apply online
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
through an app
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
um you know to take pictures of their
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
documentation and upload it's what
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
people who are entering their Workforce
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
and applying for new licenses now are
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
essentially demanding because that's how
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're conducting all of their
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
businesses additionally we have found
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
that that is the way to for us to be
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
most efficient I recognize that for all
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
all people it's not going to be one size
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
fits all which is why we have the kiosk
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
option but in terms of manual data entry
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
that requires a significant amount of
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
time of Staff time that
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
that the licensing portal will eliminate
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
by receiving applications electronically
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
it'll also eliminate the opportunity for
 
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.529 align:start position:0%
it'll also eliminate the opportunity for
errors

00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
errors
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
so in the rollout of the renewal process
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
we haven't observed any significant
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
issues with that obviously some people
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
are not fans but but for the most part
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's gone off without a hitch and it's
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
been using a portal that is ancient so I
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
suspect with a new portal it'll be even
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
be better
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
so the current rules do say that there
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
can be a paper application so you know
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
have not been making that available we
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
have paper applications in the office if
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason somebody Demands a
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
paper application but our experience has
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
been that when we walk people through
 
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
the process and educate them that they
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
much prefer the electronic process
 
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.789 align:start position:0%
much prefer the electronic process
okay

00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's it is important to
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
maintain a paper option at least till
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
you get your app up and running because
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
there are some old fogies out there who
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't who prefer not to do it on cell
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
phones and I believe there are also some
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
boards that require substantial amounts
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
of paper
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to the The Forum so for
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
those boards in particular we would want
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
to have a uh an option yeah so we we
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
have to maintain our paper documentation
 
00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
if for nothing else other than
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
continuity of operations you know for
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
system kind of we're shutting order shut
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
down we need our documentation
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
um I would say that
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
um I mean we're happy to continue to
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
offer that as a customer service option
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
that said
 
00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:38.750 align:start position:0%
that said
um

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
it does come at an increased cost in
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
terms of additional staff support so
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
that's something that I think um you
 
00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:48.539 align:start position:0%
know the commit the committee should be
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
aware you know Vermont has a similar
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
process and they are able to issue
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
licenses in 24 hours and so from a
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
Workforce standpoint when when people
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
are submitting things to be a snail mail
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
we are not able to do that and
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
um if we want to be competitive uh with
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states in terms of how
 
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:09.380 align:start position:0%
quickly we turn around licenses
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
licensing applications I think that the
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
electronic application is the way to go
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang so I just want to be clear
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
and summarize all that conversation so
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
in short people can file online if they
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
wanted yes they can come into your
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
office and you have staff to help them
 
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
if they want to file online using a
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
kiosk that's available to them in your
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
office correct and the third part you
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
also have paper available if someone
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
comes in your office and wants to apply
 
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
by paper correct thank you okay
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
do hope that as we're streamlining the
 
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
boards that we simplify the amount of
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
when I'm doing this correctly so are are
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
you going will the rules be amended to
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
identify the fact that a paper option is
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
still available because right now that's
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
a there's a cross out line through that
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
um what I would suggest if if that is
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
the committee's desire
 
00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest language to the
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
effect of
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
a paper application shall be made
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
available when an electronic version is
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
not practicable and the reason why I'd
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
like that language is because when we
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
started rolling out the renewals for
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
cosmetology cosmetologists have have
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
always done everything via paper uh they
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
they were not happy about having to move
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
to the electronic format we
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
um but once we got him there it it's
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
working and it's now we're seeing
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
greater compliance with licensure
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
renewal cosmetologists had a history and
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
a pension of just letting their licenses
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
lapse and then coming back two years
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
later and paying the extra five dollars
 
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
and get so
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
um we want we want people to try it and
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
that's why I would ask for that language
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
when you give them the option I think
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
what we'll see is that maybe 20 30
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
percent will choose paper and from a
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
staff Staffing it perspective that's not
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
something that we it can easily be
 
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.430 align:start position:0%
something that we it can easily be
managed

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions or
 
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.010 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions or
comments

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
represent fellows so
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you and I I hope that you'll
 
00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:30.419 align:start position:0%
you'll want to be a customer friendly
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
agency and make that known on the
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
website that they do have that option if
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
it the portal doesn't work if they don't
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
think they can use the portal but it's
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
obvious to them so I had a question
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
about the conversation that we just had
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
about the addresses and I'm wondering if
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
I wanted to look up somebody's license
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
and they had a fairly common name
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I need to see their address or
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
a part of the town to know if that's or
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
at least the town to know if that's the
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
person I'm thinking about you know Mary
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
Smith you know is she licensed
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I potentially I think
 
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.570 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I potentially I think
um

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
you know we take protecting people's
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
private information very seriously
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and so we could certainly have the
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether providing the
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
town is sufficiently de-aggregated
 
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.330 align:start position:0%
town is sufficiently de-aggregated
um

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
um but that has not been an issue that
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
has been raised to us in the past so
 
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.590 align:start position:0%
has been raised to us in the past so
um

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
we have not made it a practice of
 
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
publicizing people's
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
portions of people's addresses
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
typically people rely on a license
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
number you know they when they go to
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
visit a licensed professional
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
um almost all boards require that a
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
license be displayed and there's a
 
00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
number associated with that which is a
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm just thinking of a perspective
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
from the person who wants to know does
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
so and so have a license for this that I
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
thought that your portal well whatever I
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
know I can go to the website and I can
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
look up somebody's name under a specific
 
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.169 align:start position:0%
look up somebody's name under a specific
certification

00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
and I'm just isn't that part of your job
 
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
to so people will know if somebody's
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
licensed or not
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
yeah they want to find that out so how
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
how do they know that they don't have
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
some kind of address again I think most
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
people if you go to for example a salon
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
they are required mandated to not what
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
I'm asking I'm asking if I want to know
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
ahead of time is so and so licensed as
 
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.230 align:start position:0%
ahead of time is so and so licensed as
whatever

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah we provide that information online
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
the town we do not provide the town
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
because again doj the Attorney General's
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
office has advised us that releasing
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
um addresses personal addresses and
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
again we don't have a mechanism right
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
now to differentiate between business or
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
personal addresses
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
um that releasing that information is
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
considered confidential and not subject
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
to 91a
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
now I would agree with you that perhaps
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
releasing just the town may not be
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
subjects may not may be sufficiently
 
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.890 align:start position:0%
subjects may not may be sufficiently
de-aggregated

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:20.900 align:start position:0%
de-aggregated
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
practically I don't know whether DUI T
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
and again it's not an oplc system it's
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
an Enterprise solution that is extremely
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
agent could do a data extract that's
 
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
limited just to the county maybe we
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
could we've never had this issue raised
 
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
because typically people have the
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
license number and they're able to
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
verify that information through that
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
specific identifier but if there were a
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
case where you wanted to verify before
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
you got into business with this person
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
could you say well is Bob Williams of uh
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
Lebanon a licensed electrician yes
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
credits you would be we would be able to
 
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
call up the office assuming there's 17
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
Bob Williams in the state and say is
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
this person a licensed electrician yes
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
you can even request a letter of
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
verification if you want it okay thank
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
you does that help yes okay any
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn yeah so I just want
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I'm understanding I
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
thought you had said earlier that the
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
the place of business of the licensee is
 
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.990 align:start position:0%
the place of business of the licensee is
public

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
it is considered public information it's
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
not something that we publicized because
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
from a technological standpoint
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
um the boards have not always
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
consistently captured that and so
 
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
um that's what page one is trying to
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
address to make sure that we are
 
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
capturing the same data set for
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
everybody so that we can make
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
agency-wide decisions as to what can be
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
posted and what can't be posted when the
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
portal was established all of the boards
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
were operating on their own and so they
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
came up with their own demographics and
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
they came up with their own address
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and they came up with you
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
know do you capitalize do you not
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
capitalize and by virtue of that there's
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
no way for us to consistently
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
distinguish between business and
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
personal in the portal and that's why we
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
just don't extract any of that
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
information because we can't confirm
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
that it is business versus personal but
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
but couldn't you say on the couldn't you
 
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:15.260 align:start position:0%
say on page one of the portal
 
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
list your business address and why what
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
would be the problem with that list your
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
business address and then they list
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
their business address well that's what
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
this is exactly intended to allow us to
 
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
do we need that application first to
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
capture that information and then we
 
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
fully anticipate being able to release
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
the business address but we don't have
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
that capacity rate right okay I should
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
say but you're but that but you're
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
planning to do that yes yes
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
but Senator line move to conditionally
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
approved with staff edits and comments
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
made today
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative Ms oh senator in
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
his excuse me
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh those in favor
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much and while
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
we're uh into licensed professions why
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
don't we take up uh
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
the acupuncture licensing and fees that
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
yeah that's uh
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
final proposal 2020 to 170 ACP 300.
 
00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.790 align:start position:0%
final proposal 2020 to 170 ACP 300.
so

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.109 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
this is a little confusing we had some
 
00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339 align:start position:0%
some mistakes
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
um with this one
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
um it is on acupuncture licensing and I
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
think I understood from the executive
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
director this would be page two okay
 
00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:42.290 align:start position:0%
director this would be page two okay
um

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
so there actually is just one very minor
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
editorial comment on the form what
 
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
happened with this is
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
the staff at the agency filed
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
um the final proposal appropriately
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
and then we had some issues with gel car
 
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.250 align:start position:0%
and then we had some issues with gel car
staff

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.270 align:start position:0%
staff
um

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
there was a typo in our database
 
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
um and because that can happen the
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
database is old and and quite difficult
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
to use some time we have kind of a
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
second layer and so the
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
staff puts in
 
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:24.020 align:start position:0%
the numbers so that we can pull like
 
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
reports and stuff and then they email
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
they forward the attorneys the
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
information and
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
there was a typo and so the second layer
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
is the emails and
 
00:39:38.579 --> 00:39:39.470 align:start position:0%
is the emails and
um

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
I believe that I accidentally deleted
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
the email
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
and so we didn't get the timing
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
correctly so technically
 
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
approved like a you know like a pocket
 
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.370 align:start position:0%
approved like a you know like a pocket
approval

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
um because we missed the deadline but I
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
think you you did get a waiver right we
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
we had a waiver on Monday which
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
according to the um
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
the director was approved prior to the
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
time the rule would go into effect
 
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:17.099 align:start position:0%
without jail car meeting on it okay
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
but so that that's the weird thing
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
happening with this but
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
um other than that there's there's
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with the rule so
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
so nice to hear also questions or
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
comments I have implemented um a new
 
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
system for my email so that I don't
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
 
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
all right Pam coming back with regular
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
calendar back to uh the EMS
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
and then those things that came off
 
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.230 align:start position:0%
and then those things that came off
consent

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.569 --> 00:41:04.579 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
2023-11 on EMS letters of concern and
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
denial this proposal makes changes to
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
the rules on Emergency Medical Services
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
and it inserts a definition and criteria
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
for when the commissioner will issue
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
letters of concern for when an EMS
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
worker has committed an act or offense
 
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
in violation of the statute and there
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
are three main issues to discuss and
 
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:32.180 align:start position:0%
I'll take each one in turn
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
the first one is on page five of the
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
linked PDF which is page one of the rule
 
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.490 align:start position:0%
linked PDF which is page one of the rule
proposal

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that comment on the upper
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
left hand corner
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
so the department was previously in
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
regular rule making with this rule set
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
and missed the final proposal deadline
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
they did enter into interim rule making
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
which was approved and adopted but those
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
rules have expired as of November so
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing is on that first
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
section there that applies to the letter
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
of concern definition that that has been
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
expired since November so that's the
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
first issue to bring to your attention
 
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:17.660 align:start position:0%
um the second one is on the same page
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
you'll see a comment in the middle of
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
the page that says public interest
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
potentially inadequate fist
 
00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:28.820 align:start position:0%
so here um the agency has inserted a new
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
section a new Amendment if you will
 
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:33.980 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
5908.01 was not included in the notice
 
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
and it was not included you know in the
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
initial proposal so which means that um
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
it wasn't submitted over to the LBA and
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
like I said it wasn't included in the
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
notice the changes here are highlighted
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
so you'll see what changes they made to
 
00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:56.540 align:start position:0%
that section
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
the changes are are minor and they are
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
in line with the rest of what they're
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
doing in this proposal there may not be
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
a cost I I don't know but you may be
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
concerned about any Associated cost and
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
you might be concerned about the lack of
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
notice to the public for changes made to
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
this particular section
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
I can go on to the next one but if you
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
want me to stop there and we can do that
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
why don't we hear
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
hi Aaron Johnson uh rules coordinator on
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of safety so with that we
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
actually did reference the notice
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
um we pointed out in the first line of
 
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
the notice that
 
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
rsa153 a131
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
basically talks about letters of concern
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
and the rulemaking authority that we
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
have over them
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
um and pretty much what happens here is
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
in the process between the initial
 
00:43:59.329 --> 00:43:59.339 align:start position:0%
proposal and the final proposal we
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
realized that there was a little bit of
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
ambiguity where there could have been a
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
potential cost that wasn't calculated
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
um when in fact that was never safety's
 
00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:11.990 align:start position:0%
um when in fact that was never safety's
intent

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
um to where
 
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
in 5908.01 if if we look through it it's
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
basically saying the commissioner shall
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
not impose both a fine and any of the
 
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
other things originally it was just a
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
revoc a revocation or a suspension that
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
was also supposed to include a um a
 
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that doesn't quite make sense
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
so the statute as I recall when we
 
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
passed it had a added a letter of
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
concern as among the options available
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
for discipline exactly that's
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct okay so that
 
00:44:57.359 --> 00:44:58.670 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct okay so that
your

00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
this rulemaking is amending your rules
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
to allow a letter of concern in addition
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the fine and so and license denial
 
00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
and so forth that was already in statute
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
and rules is that correct it's not
 
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
at well it's adding an option to be a
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
letter of concern but it's not imposing
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
both an option or a a fine animal right
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
they're just adding among the uh
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
discipline options the letter of concern
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
as well as the fine and the licensed in
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
oil that was already in statute and
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
rules correct
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you that makes a little more sense
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
okay so the um last comment and it's um
 
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
they're related so I'll take them
 
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
together you'll see on pages eight and
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
nine at the bottom of page eight
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and that is going to be
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's page eight on the linked PDF at
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
page four the rule down at the bottom of
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
the of page eight and then at the top of
 
00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:05.579 align:start position:0%
page nine I'll take these together
 
00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
because they're kind of similar
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so this section of the rule is
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
talking about suspensions of licenses
 
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
talking about suspensions of licenses
and

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
um and the reason why we have a comment
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
here is because basically the rule lacks
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
criteria to describe for when a
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
deferment of a suspension
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
or when a rescission of that suspension
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
will be granted or not so basically the
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
rule says that a suspension may be
 
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
deferred for up to one year conditioned
 
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
upon good behavior and completion of any
 
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
requirements that need to be met but it
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't describe how the agency will
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
decide to do that how what criteria is
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to weigh in order to to defer that
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
suspension or not and that's basically
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
the same issue on the next page
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
regarding when the agency will rescind
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
that suspension the rule says that the
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
suspension may be rescinded upon the
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
licensees correction of the violation
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say that it definitely
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
shall be and it doesn't give us any
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
criteria to to know or for the public to
 
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
know how that decision is going to be
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
so the criteria is actually listed in
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
5922.11 and that's going to be on page
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
okay here it talks about suspension
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
um and it lists all the the various
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
reasons for the suspension but like I
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
said it's not
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
you know giving us um when you know if
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
if I as a licensee you know correct my
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
violation the rule doesn't say that that
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
um that suspension will definitely be
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
uh good morning my name is Jeffrey
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
Phillips I'm the system director at the
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
fire academy in EMS
 
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
um the the I guess the operational tact
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
that we've always done is 59 22 11 which
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
outlines the criteria outlines the
 
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
criteria for the actual sanction and
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
also the level of disciplinary action
 
00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so we typically will uh if we issue a
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
suspension uh depending on the severity
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
outlined in 59 22 11 will determine
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
whether the suspension can be deferred
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
whether it goes into place
 
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.230 align:start position:0%
whether it goes into place
um

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
at this time there's been no suspensions
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of or replications have
 
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
been aware of that have been rescinded
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
um but essentially the criteria that's
 
00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
outlined um and 5922 is utilized for
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
both the the level of sanction
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and also the
 
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.349 align:start position:0%
um and also the
um

00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
level of discipline
 
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.650 align:start position:0%
level of discipline
assessed

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
assessed
 
00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.750 align:start position:0%
assessed
senator

00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
so as I look at uh 2211 there I'm
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
assuming that the things in here you
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
have that mitigate and extenuating
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
circumstances so things that are
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
presented the cooperation of the
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
individual or agency being suspended
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
these are the kind of things that way
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
that will alter possibly the remove the
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
concerns and above about the criteria
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
right you'll use those considerations to
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
say all right you've resolved all the
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
issues you cooperated with our you took
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility so therefore we're going
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
to lift your suspension
 
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh correct and it also depends on what
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
the infraction is um you know I mean
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm in the world of EMS no two
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
calls are the same
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
um so it really uh whatever the
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors of the specific
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
incident if it's a protocol violation
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
really depends on the severity of the
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
pro of a protocol violation so really
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
the in the totality of the investigation
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
of the cooperation of this the service
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
or the unit or the provider in regards
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
to the individual instances of the
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
specifics of the actual caller instance
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
are all taken into consideration in
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
regards to that specific
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:07.079 --> 00:50:09.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
director

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I understand that the intent of 59 22
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
11 is to apply to rescinding
 
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.170 align:start position:0%
11 is to apply to rescinding
um

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
the action too but it says in imposing
 
00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
any sanctions under this part so it it's
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
only talking about imposing sanctions
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
and it um
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't specifically address when it
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
will be suspended although you know
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
clearly you can look at that and say
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
well this one is likely to be suspended
 
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.530 align:start position:0%
well this one is likely to be suspended
but

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.049 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to address the that that
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
issue either correct even though the
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
criteria are there in 59 22 11 the other
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
Rule still says May so regardless of the
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
criteria uh the Department's leaving
 
00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:11.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I'm I I I agree with the
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
with the way you read it but I'm not
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
what's the problem with that I mean is
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
the is the idea that the department
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have any discretion uh
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
no they absolutely can have discretion
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's just we don't know when it's going
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
to be applied or not there must be some
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
other Factor if they're saying may I
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
mean they seem to list criteria in that
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
role but they're not saying they shall
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
do that if you meet that criteria uh
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
they're still saying that they might do
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
it well but I mean I guess the concern I
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
have is the you know the more
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
the more you try to subscribe in by
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
saying this factor in this Factory I
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
mean you're really sort of limiting
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
their discretion I mean that that's
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking manual addresses this
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
issue it tells what you have to do with
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
criteria you have where you can't list
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
all the criteria there are things that
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
you might not consider but would apply
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
in an individual case you're allowed to
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
specify examples of criteria two or
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
three and then have a catch-all at the
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
end that would apply to anything else
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's unstated you also can have just a
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
simple General Criterion
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
which they seem to have in those
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
59 2204
 
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.630 align:start position:0%
59 2204
um

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
B and C but they're still not saying
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
shall they're saying may be deferred
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
may be rescinded
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
right in 541a 22 does state that no rule
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
is enforceableness it's been filed and
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
adopted and so in essence what this
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
would amount to is oral rule making that
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
can't be enforced if it's outside of um
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
like what the director was saying
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
if they had some kind of catch-all or a
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
general category of how those decisions
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
would be made then that would clarify
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
the director
 
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
however the committee's not required to
 
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
object if they feel that this is going
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
to be applied uniformly and it gives
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
adequate criteria based on the other
 
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
section then you can do what you will
 
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.809 align:start position:0%
section then you can do what you will
senator

00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
vacuums I I know representative Lynn's
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
judge is coming out a little bit but
 
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
um but I tend to agree with him I think
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
as you read 2211 when it talks about the
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
following factors to determine a level
 
00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:51.380 align:start position:0%
of disciplinary and
 
00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
sanctions imposed and the duration of
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
the discipline sanctions so that that
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
seems to me to say that this is the
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
criteria that will basically affect your
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
sentence you know for lack of a better
 
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
phrase for the judge
 
00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:06.059 align:start position:0%
um is that this is the criteria that'll
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
affect your sentence so they can say
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
cleanly in a disciplinary action saying
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
this is the sanction however if you make
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
these Corrections we can lift that
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
sanction and that's the sentence right
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
so that's their sentence so to speak
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so I I think it's clear myself I
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
think it gives them appropriate
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
discretion so that a one-time offender
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
is entreated as a murderer you know so
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
to speak and so uh I think it's clear
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
myself I think it gives them the proper
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
amount of discretion given the factors
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
that will impact the sentence of for the
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
Discord action and would the
 
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:40.609 align:start position:0%
Discord action and would the
um

00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
these the actual sanction indicate any
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
criteria for revocation or suspect or
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
suspension so that you know this is
 
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
suspended for three months while you
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
take a class or this will be
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
suspended unless you do unless you do
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
something else is that generally in the
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
letter of sanction yes when we issue a
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
letter A finding letter
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
um first of all the individual has 10
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
days to appeal through the Bureau of
 
00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
appearance of the Department of Safety
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
but additionally it outlines the
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
criteria in regards to uh what the
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
sanction is and what are the if there
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
are any corrective action requirements
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
additional training
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
um that most most of the time is
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
actually additional training you know
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
I'm in a specific instance where they
 
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
didn't do a procedure properly we would
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
require additional training and that
 
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:31.990 align:start position:0%
require additional training and that
could

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
that could change it from a we would
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
defer the suspension for a certain
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
amount of time until that training was
 
00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
done if they didn't meet that criteria
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
when the training was done then the
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
suspension would go like a full
 
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
is there a motion moved to approve with
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
staff edits Becca
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.370 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
uh
post

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
post
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.829 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
so

00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
that leaves us with the
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
um so this
 
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
is the reimbursement for mileage for
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
SNAP participants who are doing
 
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
employment and training
 
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:38.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
um we're viewing this it speaks to
 
00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for public transportation
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
including but not really limited to taxi
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
rides bus passes and ride sharing I'm
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
just concerned about how taxi rides are
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
public transportation especially because
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
they can be a more expensive solution
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious as to where that
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
allowance is
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh good morning my name is Nicole
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
valenzola I'm the rules coordinator over
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Health and Human
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
Services I do not have a program area
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
expert with me today due to the rule
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
being on consent originally
 
00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:15.950 align:start position:0%
being on consent originally
um

00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
so I don't have that specific answer for
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
you I
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
I can definitely uh ask them and get an
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
answer back to the committee
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
I know that you know we did look at this
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
we went through because I actually
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out more so that taxi seemed
 
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
outdated and so I was like are you
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
including Uber or something so that
 
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
piece was talked about at least from a
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
noticing it perspective and you know
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
they didn't raise any
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
um potential for concern or anything uh
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
yes please do get back to us on the the
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
deadline is not until after our next
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
next meeting so we will postpone this
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
until the our next meeting Madam chair
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
yes uh if I could just add a comment so
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
I live in the Upper Valley where there
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
is some Advanced Transit available to
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
our community but of course there are
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
pretty rural areas as well um where
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
there are no Uber services in the Upper
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
Valley or at least not since covid and
 
00:58:12.059 --> 00:58:12.890 align:start position:0%
Valley or at least not since covid and
um

00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
so I think taxi services are the only
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
remaining option for many people trying
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
to get to dhmc for instance for
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
appointments so I know that that is
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
probably the only viable Transportation
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
option if they don't have a vehicle and
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
are homebound or you know have this
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
temporary disability given a health care
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
issue so I just wanted to back up the
 
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
department that I know that is a readily
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
available and probably the only option
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
for many folks in the Upper Valley
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang I don't know the same thing
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I think we've capped it with the
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
number three right behind it says 100
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
limit per month so regardless of the
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
transportation services used you're
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
still capped at 100 bucks a month and I
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
know in my district Laconia same problem
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have public transportation we
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
do have taxi service we do have Uber but
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have public transportation
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
would be the only way someone could get
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
around if they didn't have their own car
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay first underfellows yeah just just
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
to add along that line I mean some
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
people may be handicapped and there may
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
be public transportation but that could
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
be difficult for them so
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
um thank you I have better understanding
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
about why that's a need and so with this
 
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
I don't object to that anymore would you
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
move to approve yes I'd move to approve
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
any further discussion thank you
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much the dental
 
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:39.589 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much the dental
services

00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so on this particular
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
item um the only comments I had were
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
editorial in nature which is why it was
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
originally on the consent list but
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
essentially what this rule is doing is
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
first off there was an update to the
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
code maintenance committee of the
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
American Dental Association and how they
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
code limited Orthodontics and
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
interceptive Orthodontics before they
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
were separate now they're combined so
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
that change was made to replace
 
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
interceptive Orthodontics with limited
 
01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:15.500 align:start position:0%
Orthodontics only the other
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
the HB
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
103 which is amending RSA 285 to extend
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
dental benefits under Medicaid Managed
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
Care programs to individuals 21 and
 
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
older which became effective on July 1st
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
2022 this particular rule only
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
removes a particular
 
01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
requirement that was needed before in
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
order to be eligible for dental care
 
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid if you were 21 and older
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
um but that was the only change of me to
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
these rules what the notice States is
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
that the implementation of HB 103 is
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
going to be done by adding a new section
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
to h e w 506
 
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
entitled Medicaid Care Management and
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
the Departments and the in the process
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
of doing that
 
01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:13.309 align:start position:0%
of doing that
um

01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that was the only changes to these
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
rules thank you representative land
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I was looking to
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
clarify we had expanded services for the
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
developmental disability acquired brain
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
injury and the CFI the independent
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
living groups for the removable
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
prostodontics and I just wanted to make
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
sure that that wasn't being expanded to
 
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
everybody 21 plus because that was
 
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.140 align:start position:0%
intended to be a benefit just for those
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
communities is that part of the
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that is coming further from
 
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
I think the department can better answer
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
that but based on what I'm reading
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
um these rules don't really touch on
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
the dental requirements for 21 and older
 
01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
it just had a very one sentence with
 
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
that strikethrough in it so I would
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
leave the department to further answer
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
your question on that
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
good morning Allison radmay I'm
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Department of
 
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services the
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit again uh this
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
rule was on the consent calendar so our
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dental director uh is at
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
another place at this time
 
01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
um I can bring any questions back to her
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
um with respect to Hew Hew 506 uh we
 
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
actually just had our public hearing on
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
that uh this past week and unfortunately
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
I don't have that file with me here it's
 
01:02:32.329 --> 01:02:32.339 align:start position:0%
actually on my desk
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
um so I can't speak to what's currently
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
in there right now where it's not in
 
01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
yes I'm not sure if it would make sense
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
the deadlines after our next meeting
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we're not
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
extending that or
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm looking for guidance I
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
apologize for pulling these off consent
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
at the last minute I'm still learning
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
the ropes and I didn't want to let
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
something go by unquestioned when I had
 
01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me Senator line
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it's okay whatever
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear the only real change
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
in this rule from the previous rule was
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
due to a coding and billing issue with
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
the Dental Association and that this
 
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
change is to take in account those
 
01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:20.339 align:start position:0%
billing requirements so that we don't
 
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
have a gap correct
 
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:26.339 align:start position:0%
and the new rules that representative
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
Leon is concerned with are in the
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
process correct and they're not we
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
expect those to be in front of you
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
probably May
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
and since it went to public hearing this
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
week the uh the rule itself and any data
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
from the public hearing is probably
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
available and um we did not nobody
 
01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:47.430 align:start position:0%
attended our public hearing
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:52.250 align:start position:0%
attended our public hearing
[Laughter]

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
how sad
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips no okay
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
right do we have a motion move to
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
approve second okay
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you those in favor
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:10.970 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
um

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
is that it there were three others that
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
were the expedited revisions to the
 
01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:18.059 align:start position:0%
licensure surveys for physicians dental
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
hygienists and the psychologists
 
01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:23.339 align:start position:0%
um it was one question in common for all
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
of those forms okay thank you my
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
question was that it was removing the
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
language on all of those um that that
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
asked if this location was owned by a
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
hospital system that seems to be a
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
really important data point for for the
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
department and for others to have
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
because the Dynamics of Hospital alone
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
versus independently owned are different
 
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious if those data are
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise available and why that section
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
has been removed from all three forms
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh Nicole valenzola again Department of
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services rules
 
01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:57.049 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services rules
coordinator

01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
um I can most certainly take that
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
question back to the program area expert
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
um so could you just repeat it again
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
though because I was I was thought I
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
would maybe able to answer off the top
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
of my head but I I cannot yes so all
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
three of them have a question that is
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
struck on
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
um let's see it's on on the the first
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
one for Physicians it's question number
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
22. could you sorry could you tell me
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
the um notice number yes 2023-1 okay
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
which page again on that I'll pull up
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
the page but I know it was question
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's on page eight Nicole thank you
 
01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:42.650 align:start position:0%
it's on page eight Nicole thank you
22.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
oh the 22 that was struck through not
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
the new 22. correct okay
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
and that has been struck from all three
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
of those forms
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
probably for the same reason
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
I maybe I don't know I'll find out for
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:01.730 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
um

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
why and then you were saying that you
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
believe that this is important data so
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
is it available elsewhere yes if it's
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
already collected it doesn't I'm not
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
sure that it needs to be in the
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
licensure but that is very important
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
because it changes it it impacts the
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
all right and actually on the Physicians
 
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
I did have the question about why we're
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
getting rid of some of the Specialties
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
um gynecologic oncology hematologic
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
oncology have been Consolidated into
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
oncology I'll pull up which page that is
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
I just need the notice number again yes
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
six of the form it's the area of
 
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.329 align:start position:0%
six of the form it's the area of
practice

01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
and gynecologic oncology is struck
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
oncology in Hematology Oncology is
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
struck so that it's just hematology so
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
all of oncology is put into one section
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's been added down below and then
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
when you get to page seven on the
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
surgery sub-specialties all of those
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
sub-specialties have been removed and
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
there's just the general basket for
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
surgery subspecialties
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
and knowing that access to care and
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
having care here in New Hampshire is
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
important I'm just curious um why those
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
data are being removed from these
 
01:07:25.079 --> 01:07:27.710 align:start position:0%
data are being removed from these
surveys

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to page six the gynecologic
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
oncology and the hematology and oncology
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
but including oncology as a one
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
catch-all beneath just a question as to
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
why that was done that way yes I'm
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
curious as to why that's removed because
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
guys gynecologic oncology there's a lot
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
of um specific needs with that and and I
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
think that that that's that's an
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
important one to call out although I
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
appreciate that perhaps you're just
 
01:07:59.569 --> 01:07:59.579 align:start position:0%
consolidating them into tighter buckets
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
so that you don't have some details
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
without others
 
01:08:03.359 --> 01:08:05.809 align:start position:0%
without others
okay

01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
I have a question for oh sorry
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh attorney morals like Mike
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
um with expiration to forms typically
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
this would be now
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
move to a doc you know it was on consent
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
move to adopt and then it goes in place
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I know they have deadlines with
 
01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
respect to getting these
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
surveys out and so I guess I don't know
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
about when I know you're talking about
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
like the next gel car or something and
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
that might be a concern but if the
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
committee wish this could be postponed
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
there is no deadline for Committee
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
Action on expedited revisions to form so
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
if if the department confers then well
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
it's up to the committee but to I don't
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
know if that would cause any heartburn
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
with the Department this first time
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
um I know that there are some of these
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
and so I don't
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:13.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
if you approve and
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
um the agency brings back the
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
information you want and gel cart
 
01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
dislikes it you could then petition to
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
have them change the forms again
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable okay thank you is
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
there a motion to approve them I'll move
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
well can we do all three Awards should
 
01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:37.460 align:start position:0%
we have to do an individual
 
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
sorry just again so
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
because the clarificate for all three of
 
01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:44.660 align:start position:0%
them was the question
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
I started writing the H but
 
01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
okay so Madam chair I moved to approve
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
all right can you just session

sort of lost track of as to
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
what we're doing so the emotion is to
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
approve all three of these expedited
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
will petition for them to do another
 
01:10:37.689 --> 01:10:37.699 align:start position:0%
