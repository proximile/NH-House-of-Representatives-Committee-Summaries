00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
this uh this item is moot what the
 
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
department has done is taken it off the
 
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 align:start position:0%
market and we're gonna uh retain it and
 
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
look for opportunities to use it for
 
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
mitigation credit on future projects
 
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
so we'd ask that the committee either
 
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
find it moot or
 
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
refuse it or
 
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
reminded i was remiss in one thing i
 
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
would accept the motion to remove this
 
00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 align:start position:0%
from the table
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh second atmosphere they moved and
 
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
seconded that we were by representative
 
00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 align:start position:0%
mills and representative claudia that
 
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
removed from the table
 
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we've heard the
 
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
the department talk about that we will
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
have a vote all those in favor taking it
 
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
off the table say thing why by saying
 
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
aye aye aye
 
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
all those opposed
 
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and it's off the table
 
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
and we've heard from the department do
 
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
we need a vote senator dallas thank you
 
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
mr chamber i i think what uh mr lavoie
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
said makes a lot of sense yeah you kept
 
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
lowering the price and nobody wants it
 
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
why why should we we shouldn't give it
 
00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
away we paid dearly for this property i
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
i bet to the best of my knowledge we
 
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
paid a fortune for this land
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it's worth it for mitigation
 
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
purposes it's worth retaining so i think
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea
 
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
i take it from the postulate version and
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you senator d'alessandro um and
 
00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
that was the the essence of our
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
discussion at the last meeting was we
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
keep lowering the price and we're going
 
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 align:start position:0%
to end up
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
um giving it away yeah giving it away
 
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
do i don't think we need
 
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
if it's been withdrawn
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
is that that's
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
mr coleman's property
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
so selling it directly to him actually
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
benefits both the department and mr
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
coleman because otherwise we would have
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
had to
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
value the property as vacant land and
 
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
value the property as vacant land and
then

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
deduct the cost of raising the building
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
because it sits on the abutting property
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
also acquired in that acquisition
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
um was a 10 032 square foot drainage
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
easement a 37 000
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh and 71 square foot temporary slope
 
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
easement a 4
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
79 square foot temporary drive easement
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
square foot temporary construction
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
easement the department is retaining uh
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
50 feet of a 50 foot wide right of way
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
and as i just mentioned the department
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
both the department and and
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
grantee uh benefit from this sale is
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
upon the building
 
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
we overpaid for this as what happens
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
when you're doing eminent domain
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
what happens is we condemn on the
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
property based on our appraisal it goes
 
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
to the btla
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
they come up with their finding this one
 
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.029 align:start position:0%
they come up with their finding this one
then

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
got appealed to the superior court
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro thank you mr just
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
one when when when are we going to be
 
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
one when when when are we going to be
finished

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
finished
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
with disposing of all of the property we
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
purchased for the conway bypass remember
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
i lived in conway
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
so i know a little bit about the conway
 
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.629 align:start position:0%
so i know a little bit about the conway
bypass

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
bypass
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
that never came to fruition but but
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
now how much did we pay back to the to
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
the feds 25 million or 30 billion wasn't
 
00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:21.990 align:start position:0%
the feds 25 million or 30 billion wasn't
that

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
where uh the last figure i had heard
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
were on the hook for around 28 billion
 
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.150 align:start position:0%
were on the hook for around 28 billion
20

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.869 align:start position:0%
20
and

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
we've got to get decent
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
prices for these properties
 
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.190 align:start position:0%
prices for these properties
uh

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
i just i hope we're vigilant i i
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
recognize that we we tried this a long
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
long time ago and
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
obviously it was pretty it was a good
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
idea when you look at the traffic but
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
indeed it never came to fruition
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
so we have to do what we have to do but
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
i think the board uh this group ought to
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
be cognizant of the fact that we paid
 
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.750 align:start position:0%
be cognizant of the fact that we paid
dearly

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
dearly
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
for all of this property
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're getting out of it we had to pay
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
the government back we had to pay the
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
debts back about 28 million
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
so we we we have to be cautious as we're
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
going forward and
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
look at these i think we are and for
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
those of us who are on
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.269 align:start position:0%
in that

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%

our appraisal section is just backed up

and we can't get the appraisal through
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%

00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%

go in and construct it
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a 30 foot wide
 
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.430 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a 30 foot wide

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the instance that either this
 
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.549 align:start position:0%
in the instance that either this
committee

00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:46.310 align:start position:0%
committee
or

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
the governor and council don't approve
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
the easement the town understands that
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
basically the water line will be there
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
by sufferance and if the state ever
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
needed that property for a project or
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
the town would then have to move the
 
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.310 align:start position:0%
the town would then have to move the
lines

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
any questions of the department
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
speaking only for myself and i'm
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
not even speaking for the committee i
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
if it goes forward i don't see a problem
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
with with granting an easement in the
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
fall if you can get it done but remember
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
this body turns into pumpkins in early
 
00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:29.590 align:start position:0%
this body turns into pumpkins in early
december

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
december
because

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
the new legislature will be meeting
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
after on the first wednesday after the
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
first tuesday in december
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
so this body will go away so we come
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
some of us will submit mr chairman if i
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
may so that means we'll have a september
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
meeting and then a november meeting uh
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
we will get to that in a moment
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
any questions on this
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
the only reason i say that is to
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
work hard at it so that you know the
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
town isn't just on sufferance for years
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
we'll do thank you
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
