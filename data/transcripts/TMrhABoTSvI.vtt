00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
how far do you think we should go with
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
this your amendment is very brief so
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's I think I guess a positive
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that I heard loud and
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
clear in the couple other times that I
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
was before this committee was a desire
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
to have there be some real specificity
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of what map you know what what
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
disclosures about flood risk we're
 
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.710 align:start position:0%
disclosures about flood risk we're
talking

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
about um and I've attempted to I
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
attempted to address that in the last
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have which is um
 
00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
128 by including language that says that
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and it's on page 30 uh page one lines
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
30 and
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
31 actually it starts on page two um so
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
that we are very clear that it's the
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
official Insurance flood map official
 
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
flood insurance map provided by FEMA as
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
of the date that a purchase that the
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale agreement is signed
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
and if the answer is yes to that
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
question then you attach a copy of that
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
official flood insurance map so I I I
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
hoped that that would address that that
 
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.069 align:start position:0%
hoped that that would address that that
specific

00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
concern um the the amendment that you've
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
prepared um Mr chairman you know doesn't
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
get that specific I mean it just talks
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
about you know that that it's in a flood
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
zone and so that seems to go against the
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
direction that this subcommittee was
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
going when I was when I was
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
talking um the other thing that I did in
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment in Amendment 128 again at
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
the um well let me let me just follow up
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
on that the one thing that is still in
 
00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:10.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment 128 is protection for a
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
seller who relies on someone else to
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
provide them with information about
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
flood disclosure that's that's Now new
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
section two in the amendment so that's
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
still in there to provide that
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
protection for
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
sellers um which I think is a is a is a
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
is a a significant benefit the other
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
thing that the amendment does which I
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
think reflects the a lot of the concern
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
that was expressed by the
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee in previous discussions was
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
we've taken out everything relating to
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
to landlords and tenants it's completely
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
out um so that this bill only focuses on
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
sellers um there was a concern also
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
about there was a concern expressed
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
about having buyers kind of coign so
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
that they are acknowledging that you
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
know that that they know that there's a
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
flood risk what amendment 128 does by
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
including the language around flood
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure in a purchase and sale
 
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
agreement that must be signed by both
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
the seller and the buyer so that closes
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
that Loop so
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I think
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
128 is a is a
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
is a tighter a tighter bill in terms of
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
providing some
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
real um protection for buyers and
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
sellers um and um you know hopefully
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
addresses the specificity that you were
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
all looking
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
for okay representative M um this is a
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
question for for you Mr chairman you
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
said you negotiated with the Realtors
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
what what exactly was their their
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
holding point they will speak next next
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry they will speak next they will
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
speak now all
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
right and and and just to
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
clarify um the actual information on the
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
flood in uh insurance is not in the
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
purchase and sales agreement it's
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually in the disclosure agreement and
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
the disclosure agreement is made by the
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
the seller and the seller's agent when
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
the when the house is put on the market
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
so we keep referring to the the the uh
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
purchase and sales there is a question
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
in the purchase and sales but that's
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
completed by the buyer and the buyer is
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
asking about flood insurance and and
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
flood but again that information has
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
already or should have already been
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
provided by the seller so I just want to
 
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.390 align:start position:0%
provided by the seller so I just want to
clarify

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
that right so yeah so that that this
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
chart amendment is is uh amending what
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be in the purchase and sales
 
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.230 align:start position:0%
needs to be in the purchase and sales
agreement

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
I I would have to agree with
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative M I think
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
am much
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
tighter really gets to the point as
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to being a little vague I think
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
well but we're trying to get it to the
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
purchase sale agreement which was as we
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
decide that's a more important document
 
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.350 align:start position:0%
decide that's a more important document
Mr

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
chair yeah
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
um um the reason that um the language on
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
flood disclosure is included in RSA
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
4774 is that that's that's the RSA
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's referenced in the purchase and
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
sale agreement right so what this is
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
doing is adding flood disclosure at the
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
same level putting it at the same level
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
of importance hopefully putting it at
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
the same level of importance as radon
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
Arsenic and Lead which are currently in
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
the purchase and sale agreement right
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
okay any
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%

Amendment

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
um sorry TW Amendment 128 uh I think it
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
is clearer than Amendment
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
us thank you for taking my question so
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
where is the realtor in terms of
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
responsibility here is it lying strictly
 
00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
with the um the seller and the buyer and
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
the people who provide the information
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of flooding Etc it it it's
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
really between the seller and the buyer
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
and and and I think um you know there
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
was a lot of discussion in the last
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about you know third party
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
this and third party that um and i' like
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
to thank representative melier here for
 
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
hope hopefully kind of bringing us back
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
to you know what we're really talking
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
about I mean the responsibility that
 
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create here is be is is
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
the it's the seller's responsibility if
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
the seller relies on someone else to
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
help them get that information realtor
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
professional engineer
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
whatever um then we're you know that's
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
up to the seller um we are providing
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
some protection for the seller that in
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
the event that that third party sorry to
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
bring that up again third party um you
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
know does something incorrect or
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
provides false information that the
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
seller has some recourse followup please
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
further question may inquire okay so I'm
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
still struggling I don't remember
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative spear said last time that
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
the realtor is making a commission on
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
the sale um um on of this so I I just a
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
little struggling with the fact that
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
there's you know if they are
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
representing the buyer that there's no
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
no responsibility there for any any
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
anything that happens as a result of
 
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.950 align:start position:0%
anything that happens as a result of
flooding

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
Etc yeah I don't I don't know that I've
 
00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:08.919 align:start position:0%
got a real answer to that I mean the
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
only thing I would go back to is that
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
the purchase and sale agreement is
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
signed by the buyer the seller and the
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
buyer it's not signed by the agent okay
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative M if
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
I can make a comment on that if the
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
seller's agent knows something they have
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
to divulge that as well not just the
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
seller but so in other words if the
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
selling agent knew that this was in a
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
flood zone but the seller didn't
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
indicate that it would be the
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
seller's agent that would have to
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
disclose that but shouldn't the seller
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
have done some the agents done some
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
digging um repeat that
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
please the realtor shouldn't they have
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
own there I don't believe that the
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
selling agent is required to do that um
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
I think they would if they're doing the
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
right job for the seller they might also
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
look into it but again um if they don't
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
know information they're not required to
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
disclose what they don't know but if
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
they do know information they are
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
required to disclose it I hope that
 
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.590 align:start position:0%
required to disclose it I hope that
answers

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
that okay so um just to make sure I'm
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
clear um we'll start with the section
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
two of the bill which is um obviously
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
starts at the bottom of page two which
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
is this flood risk
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
disclosure and um do do we have this
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
kind of language for for uh for lead or
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh arsonic or Raid on I don't think
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
so not not this not this whole remedy
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
section in terms of if you remember our
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
public hearing our subcommittee last
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
time was that that we got came down to
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day is that if a buyer
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
feels like they were
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
give misinformation or lack information
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
or incorrect information you were trying
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
to find some way that they could sue
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
them which
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
obviously you know that doesn't really
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
solve anything I mean in your mind it
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
might solve things but in my mind this
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
just creates another lawsuit and and a
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
financial burden on on that buyer so I'm
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't too crazy about that and then
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
when I look if if it's also correct when
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
I look at what you're doing is that in
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing amending the putting all
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
this language that is in
 
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.549 align:start position:0%
this language that is in
4774

00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:45.559 align:start position:0%
4774
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
a okay whereas um it in terms of where I
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
was looking in the statute was this um
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
was the 474 D you know Roman one where
 
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
what was needed specifically to be in
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
the purchase and sale agreement whereas
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
this is this
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
is uh how the best I would describe it
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
this is sort of um explanatory or
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge giving or helping people to
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
know what things they should know rather
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
than specifically saying whereas in what
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
in this our amendment is what exactly
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be in that purchas sale
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
agreement and really lay it out and
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
spell it out that that this these have
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
to be in there and but they end up
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
having the same result because they have
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
the result that we're we're saying a is
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
what's the flood zone which is what you
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
were concerned about where where is
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
where is what is the flood zone and and
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
two is whether that person had insurance
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
or not had flood insurance so it seems
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
like they both do the same thing it's
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
just that a is where you know be you
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
know where they're in and B is I don't
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
all I see in here is the stuff you're
 
00:25:59.389 --> 00:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
saying they need to do but it doesn't
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
actually have that what we have in this
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
amendment specifically saying this needs
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
to be in that purchase sale
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
agreement um you know I I'll I'll I'll
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
defer to your understanding of the rsa's
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know over mine any day but I'm
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the purchase and sale
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
agreement right now right and it says in
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
compliance with the requirements of RSA
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
4774 Dasa the following information is
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
provided to buyer buyer blah blah blah
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what I started with I I
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
was trying to use an existing document
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
correct and I figured if I amended
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
477 4A that would then require flood
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
disclosure to be included on here right
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
well because that because the problem
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
was we when it comes to um Arsenic and
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
and the lead or radon I know if radon in
 
00:26:56.909 --> 00:26:56.919 align:start position:0%
particular say is that the in terms of
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
testing but testing was never required
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
or never done it was really to inform
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
people that they should have it tested
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
but in terms of and then and so that
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
statue might s said if if it's been
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
tested but it never it never required to
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
be tested and so the idea is that you
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
want whatever we're requiring is we're
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
asking things that had to that that had
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
to have a positive answer you had to
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
have you have to tell you have to tell
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
them you know relative to the location
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's on a flood map or not
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's a requirement that is a positive
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
you have to do that and then and then
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
whether the seller has flood insurance
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
you they have to say yes or no and
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought you were trying to
 
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
get at do you wanted to get away from um
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
I don't know yeah no I mean we're trying
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
to make you know include specific
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions that have to be answered yes
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
or no okay yes okay any other questions
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you very much
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you members of the committee
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's been my thrill to be with you
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
these past three times so hopefully
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.750 align:start position:0%
 
sometime

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
up hello my name is Bob Quinn I am the
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
CEO of the New Hampshire Association of
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
Realtors I'm Joanie McIntyre I'm the
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
president of the Realtors
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
association so um I think if we
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
understand the intent behind the amended
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
version of the bill uh as representative
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
months um indicated it appears that um
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
what he wants to try and do is require a
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
seller to indicate whether or not um the
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
property is uh in a M area um so it
 
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
would be the only requirement uh in
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
statute or any place where a seller
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
would be mandated to have to answer yes
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
or no to a question um we do have
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
concerns about that in that what it's
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
sort of saying to um a buyer is hey
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't worry about doing your own due
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
diligence um trust what the seller is
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
telling you we don't think that's a good
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
idea it doesn't exist any place else on
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
our purchase and sale it doesn't exist
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
any place else in stat
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh in addition when you require that
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
this bill on page three under 540 D1 is
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
setting up a unique civil remedy for
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
flood insurance that would only apply to
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
issues regarding flood insurance so how
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
does that impact uh failure to properly
 
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
disclose on other issues such as septic
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
um private drinking water insulation Etc
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
you're setting up a unique
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
process just for flood
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
insurance and talking to our attorney he
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure why and he wasn't sure the
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
implications that that would have with
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
other disclosures so that's a real
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
concern for us and then in the final
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
section on page three section five it
 
00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519 align:start position:0%
says sort of okay seller you have to
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
answer yes or no but if you hire a
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
certified professional engineer or a
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
land surveyor then it's basically your
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
liability is going to be
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
removed so even if a seller would to
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
live on the side of a hill and they go
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
to their attorney and they look at the
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale agreement the the
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
attorney's probably going to say look if
 
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
you don't want any
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
liability you're going to want to hire a
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
land surveyor or professional engineer
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
in order to zero out that liability we
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
don't think that's necessary and we also
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
think that what is the proper thing to
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
do is to encourage buyers always to do
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
their own deal due diligence no matter I
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
think representative mcleer will tell
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
you this um president McIntyre will tell
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
you this we would always recommend even
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
if the seller brings information even if
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
it brings a a a test for water quality
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
on a private well buyers should always
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
do their own due diligence and doing
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
their own water test to to guarantee
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct this legislation is
 
00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
pushing it in the other direction and
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
it's saying no no trust the seller the
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
seller's going to give you proper
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
information and I don't think that's the
 
00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:37.750 align:start position:0%
information and I don't think that's the
right

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
direction um I would agree on that and I
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
would say just as a matter of
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
information for you we do not fill out
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
those disclosures in any way the the the
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
seller fills out the disclosure and we
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
are not responsible for digging in and
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
trying to find out more information and
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
if we have knowledge of something that
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
we know is material a material defect we
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
need to encourage the seller to disclose
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
that or we back out of the sale I don't
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
want to be in a in a imp party to
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
something where uh basement floods and
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
they say no don't tell anyone that's not
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
a that's not a a property that I want to
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
be involved in um if if a um seller
 
00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.629 align:start position:0%
be involved in um if if a um seller
brings

00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
brings
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
um a water test from a year ago and
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
offers that to the buyer I would still
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
as a buyer represent representative ask
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
the buyer to do their own water test
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
things change um they would want the
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
most upto-date information and I would
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
say the same would be true about uh a
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
flood flood situation they should call
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
their insurance agent make sure that
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's not um in a flood zone I would not
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
um recommend that my buyers rely on
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
information given to them by the
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
sellers um Beyond they they really
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
should look into it on their own just to
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
to certify that it's
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
true and just to reiterate what the
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
chairman had mentioned earlier regarding
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
4774 a so those are the notifications on
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
radon arsic and lead and by the way um
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives recently
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
passed a new notification requirement on
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
P pass uh which we do support and is on
 
00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
the Senate side and I would expect that
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
to to pass as well so that would be the
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
fourth all of those have to do with um
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
contaminants um right on ARS neck lead
 
00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
so things like um water supply and other
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
things which are mandated by the
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
legislature are in fact not in 4774 a um
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
but are in
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
4774 D so for consistency um we would
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
encourage that the change be made in
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
4774 D in the amendment I think there is
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
um the I think that the total lines that
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
would be added to our purchase and sale
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
for flood would be 36 lines um radon is
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
about five right now um arsonic is seven
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
so you are it is not I don't think
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
proportional in terms of notification I
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
think it would be sending a message to
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
buyers that the most important thing
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
they need to review in purchasing a home
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
is flood
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
insurance uh and I think that's probably
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
not a message that we particularly
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
should be sending uh to buyers I think
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
all of these things are are very
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
equally yes a question
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
for thank you for taking my
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
question I think a buy
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
should really know about flood if if the
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh flood flooding if the property is in
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
a flood zone I think it should be
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
revealed that it is in flood zone
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
because this is 2024 I have photographs
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
from all throughout the state regarding
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
flooding that is occurring um almost
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
every time it rains now so I think it's
 
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:27.079 align:start position:0%
very important for a buyer to know if it
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
is in a flood zone and whether it's the
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
I think the realtor should be
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
think so I can tell you a personal
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
situation I bought a condominium um 16
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
years ago in South Carolina and it was
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
not in a flood zone and has not been in
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
a flood zone for 15 years and I think it
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
may have been put in a flood zone in the
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
last year because of a special
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
assessment I received but I've I don't
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
have flood insurance and I can't say for
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
sure if it isn't in a flood zone so and
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
and actually that property is for sale
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
right now on my disclosure I checked
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
unknown um I really I honestly don't
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
know for sure and I looked it up this
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
morning um on the flood map and I still
 
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.950 align:start position:0%
morning um on the flood map and I still
can't

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
tell so I I think unknown is a is an
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
there okay represent back um thank you
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that in looking at uh
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
disclosures uh the the default message
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
is unknown so people haven't bothered to
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
look into this and they just check
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
unknown but you said you looked at the
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
flood map did did you look at the flood
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
map I did this morning I and and it
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
didn't say it was in a flood zone I
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
can't really tell from the flood map
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to um to interpret um I
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
would and I don't have in in this case I
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a mortgage on that um piece
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
of property
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
um I've my insurance company hasn't said
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
to be you're now in a flood zone if I
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
were representing
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
someone who were going to buy that
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
property it's not mine somebody else's
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm representing a buyer I would
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
check on on the purchase and sale that
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
that's one of their due diligence to
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
check pledge insurance and they would
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
call their insurance company for one and
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
the insurance company um Can interpret
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
them pretty well um and you know that I
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
would encourage them to do that due
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
diligence I wouldn't go by yes or yes or
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
no or unknown because if they say no and
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
their Ins Insurance company says yes
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
it's in a flood G should they not buy
 
00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:08.550 align:start position:0%
it's in a flood G should they not buy
flood

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
insurance repres represent burough so I
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
guess the thing I'm thanks for taking my
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
question the thing I'm struggling with
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
like in that scenario and you said you
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
didn't know obviously that was the that
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
was true did you have a responsibility
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
to ask professional you know call
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
whoever FEMA to find out what the story
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
was because I mean everybody could check
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
know with doing nothing
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
right so just to reiterate on the on the
 
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
property disclosure form right now um I
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
just want to just read it it says is
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
this property located in a federally
 
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
designated flood Hazard Zone yes no or
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
unknown now the property disclosure as
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative mle pointed out that is
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
filled out by the seller all right so
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not they know or don't know
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and if they have a realtor the
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
realtor is representing in that case the
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
seller if the buyer has their own agent
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
all right and the agent comes across
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
that and it says unknown then that buyer
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
agent would have some responsibility to
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
work with that client to identify
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not so if you're in I think
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
the example came up in Hampton you know
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
so if you're representing a a buyer in
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
Hampton you're an agent and you never
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
bring up the fact if you're the agent
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
that hey maybe we should go check the
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
flood zone look he said it's unknown you
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
are a liable all right I mean if if
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
something went wrong if that was
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
inaccurate information that was or it
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't even brought up um then that
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
agent is at Great legal risk uh in any
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
lawsuit so I think it is important to
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
keep in mind who fills out the property
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
disclosure form who fills out and signs
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
the purchas and sale and I will point
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
out that in the amendment on 477 D if
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
you read if you read the entire statute
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
it does require in all of these um that
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
it is written and that the buyer has to
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
accept it and acknowledge
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
um by signing it and that's what happens
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
on the on our form currently so they
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
would have to acknowledge that they've
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
received this representative
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is a question uh regarding the
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
example that was given about the South
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
Carolina property um where you couldn't
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
tell on the flood zone map whether the
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
property was in the flood zone or not
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
but isn't there someone that you could
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
call who could interpret that flood zone
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
map for you and so that you could
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually find out whether the property
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
is in a flood zone or not because a lot
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
of this came up because we heard a fair
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
amount of testimony about people who
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
thought their property wasn't in a flood
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
zone um and I guess when they bought it
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
unknown had been checked uh and they
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
thought there was no information but
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
then if they tried to get a mortgage the
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
bank told them it was in a flood zone uh
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
or if they tried to sell it it was in a
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
flood zone and this that this created
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
problems for them so is there is there
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
some way that you could check
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
well yeah there is but important to
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
point out that um in 2021 in New
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically um there was a a
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
great deal of change in the flood maps
 
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
flood maps change frequently um and in
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
2021 on the Sea Coast there was a major
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
revision that was that was done so
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
someone could very well have purchased a
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
home in 2018 that was not in a flood
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
zone when they go to refinance in 20123
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
it is in a flood zone everyone during
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
that initial purchase and sale did
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
everything properly they did their due
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
diligence realized it wasn't but now all
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
of a sudden they go to refinance and it
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
is and that happens relatively
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
frequently uh follow-up
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
question well actually I have another
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
idea on how to solve this problem so if
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
after my question if if it doesn't feel
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
like it solves it for you then then you
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
can ask your other question okay so
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
given that un under D it actually asks
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
the question the d uh one ask question
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
about these other products radon
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
Arsenic and Lead whatever how
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
about we working from this amendment
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
that you and I agreed on we add a
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman numeral
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
five and we we don't tell we don't get
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
into the yes no parts we just get into
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
the part about uh and I was looking at
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
actually six
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
which is what is a flood zone and what
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
is insurance and that you know some of
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
that can we just take this some of that
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
language and narrow it down put it you
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
know short and sweet like we have with
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
radon and arsonic and lead to get to the
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
point that this is something that you
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
should be aware of and that this that
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know that there are blood maps are
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
available to you so you're talking about
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
putting it into the 4774 a just A1 one
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph Just Like These paragraphs are
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
written that are because if I if if I
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
remember and I am getting older but
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
because I feel like I was in the room
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
for all three of these I think all three
 
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
of these came to commer and my memory
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
was that we had we just had this one we
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
had this Roman numeral which helps
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
describe the problem to people that were
 
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.069 align:start position:0%
describe the problem to people that were
being

00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
educational and then we had this D Roman
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know Roman numerals which had those
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
letters which actually was those
 
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.630 align:start position:0%
letters which actually was those
specific

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
questions I know you probably in Jump In
 
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
Joy with this but because I would we
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
need this paragraph done uh by tomorrow
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
morning or actually today so I can have
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment drawn up for tomorrow
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
morning adding this and had just
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
taking I'm sure represent M's worked
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
very hard in all this language so taking
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
this language and eding it to a short
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
and sweet paragraph which educates
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
people how important flood flooding is
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
an issue and that's why we're going to
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
ask this okay so that's an idea so we're
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
going to walk go around the room and
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative givs has her hands up
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
first so go ahead representative Gibbs
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um okay uh back to I I
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
actually now have two questions um but
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
back to my follow-up question earlier
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay um you were talking about what
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
might have happened in 2018 and so forth
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
but today if you're selling a property
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
and you can't interpret the flood map is
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
there somebody that you could call and
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
find out and get that flood map
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted and if there is shouldn't
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
you do that that's that's question
 
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.589 align:start position:0%
you do that that's that's question
number

00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
one possibly you should but I do think
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
put to have the M sorry I I I believe
 
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
that the bu it's important that the
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
buyer deter
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
that information they are the one buying
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
the property and they need to call the
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
call and find out if it's in a flood
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
mouth and then um my my second question
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid Mr chairman um uh is for you
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
and that is um uh as as I said earlier
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
it seemed like um uh the uh and
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
generally I'm not in favor of longer
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
language um but it seemed that the
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
longer language um in uh 128 uh did some
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
provide some additional Clarity and
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
specificity in terms of definitions and
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
so forth um so I I guess my question is
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
why would we want to uh eliminate that
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
that specificity because they have this
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes and no section so I'm not
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating it I'm just trying to get
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
this I'm trying to mirror what we've
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
already have in the statute and in the
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
statute we have
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't call them you know short
 
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
paragraphs because they have multiple
 
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
sentences in them but that in those they
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
talked about radon Arsenic and lead and
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
so now we want to add flooding and we
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
want a
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph with enough sentences that a
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
let people understand how important this
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
is that they need to be you know to know
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
if they're in a flood zone and B where
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
they get the information to solve it and
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
that is we're talking about these flood
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
maps now we all can go on and on and on
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
about how how flood maps are are are
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
faulty but I'm sure you could say the
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
same thing about radon tests and arnic
 
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
test and let alone live whether you you
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
whether you don't know how long the
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
house really you know went when was the
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
last time it was painted so at the end
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the day all I was trying to do is
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
mirror what we did with those three have
 
00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
a little paragraph in there about how
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
important it is but that the the meat of
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
the bill and the same thing for raon
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
artsn and Le the meat of the bill was
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
actually in
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
4-D which had those specific positive
 
00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:43.559 align:start position:0%
actions that the seller must take to
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
help the uh but at the end of the day
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
and we all know what's happened this
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
last this last year everybody was buying
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
the houses with cash they weren't even
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
doing due diligence they were so worried
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
about trying finding make the sale okay
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
and that is a problem and we can't we
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
legislature can never fix that problem
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
but we all know at the end of the day
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
the reason why a purchase sale agreement
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't close the next day is because
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
there is due diligence requirements you
 
00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
know and and and I'll have to say I
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
remember this this question way back in
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
when it came with rate onor that at the
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
end of the day it is the buyer's
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to write in the purchase
 
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
responsibility to write in the purchase
sale

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
sale
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
agreement that for before the closing
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
can occur XYZ needs to occur X you need
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
to fix that leaky porch B is you need to
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
do a radon test okay all those things
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
need can are normally written into it so
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is we're
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
discussing things that buyers should be
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
doing but we all know that sometimes
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
buyers are who come from to stay or
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
unaware of radon or unaware of of of
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
lead on paint or something but now we're
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
adding another category and saying is a
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
we want to educate
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
them tell them where they can get it
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
answered have a place where they really
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
have to respond where that you know that
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's this is a checkpoint where the
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
Brokers have to say did the seller
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
answer those two questions
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
directly representative Ms you have a
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
comment just take that mic right there
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
that'd be
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
compromise as usual I think it's a very
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
elegant elegant compromise I think I
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
could I could live with that um the the
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
the suggestion I would I would make in
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
terms of the language that you're
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
looking for is if you look at the the
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that I submitted 128 H
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
starting at 27 line 27 yep flooding um
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know I would I would I would include
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
that and at the end of line 29 what I
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
would then add is I would I would reord
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
line 29 to say you are encouraged to
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
examine your policy to determine whether
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
you are covered and the official flood
 
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
insurance map provided by FEMA for your
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
community and then end it there I think
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
that's what you're and then we again
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
that was the seller or the buyer this is
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
a a message to the we're trying we're
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
trying to educate the
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
buyer so so you have to say buyer you
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
you you can I guess you can ask the
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
seller for a copy of their insurance is
 
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
that is that appropriate you can't
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
really ask them for that but we are
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
asking them that they they identify
 
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
whether they have flood insurance well
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
what what I mean what the the the the
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
point that we're trying to make here is
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
that in terms of education is that uh
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
for a for a buyer a standard homeowners
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
insurance isn't going to cover you
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
against floods you've got to you've got
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to get we're
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
educating them about flood that's what
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
that's trying to get at and where at a
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
where you can get the flood insurance or
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
VI you should get it if uh if and then
 
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
put in in there that you know to get get
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
this National flood insurance Maps yeah
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
and and and I think the the other thing
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
encourage and I I think we're probably
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
focusing on the buyer here now that I me
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
now that I think about it that to
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
encourage the buyer to go look the maps
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
to see for themselves whether there's a
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
problem if if so I think if you added
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
that that would be okay you could then
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
take out everything starting on line two
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
on page two through line 10 and then it
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're agreeable to leaving
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
section six which is kind of the
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
explaining what the hell we're talking
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
about you know what a flood zone is ETC
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
leave that in so through line 33 and
 
00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:56.799 align:start position:0%
then everything else comes out the I
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
just don't want to be too long about
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
this okay I think if you put a and b in
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
it would be can I make a suggestion okay
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
the okay does have the map about the map
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
right so A and B Mr chairman can I make
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
a suggestion yes because we did
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
something like this with the Department
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services on some of the
 
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
other issues where same issue it was
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
going to be very lengthy we put in the
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
website so if you look at arnik there's
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
a link link to a website that tells the
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
buyer as well as the agent where they
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
can go if we did those first two lines
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
and then put for additional information
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
go to fema.gov that's going to tell that
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
buyer and that agent where to go to get
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
additional information so
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
cnly one thing that we do we start out
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
with the arsonic right you said you're
 
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
going arsenic right arsonic is a common
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
ground water containment uh containment
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that occurs at
 
00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
unhealthy levels in wellwater and many
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
areas of the state okay so we want to
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
describe flooding in one
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
sense yep right and then and then tests
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
are available and so we want to say yes
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
you and you can find out whether you're
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
in the flood zone and be aware that
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
flood insurance is not I think I think
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's important to let people know that
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
flood insurance is a is separate from
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
your homeowners sure I think that
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
sentence to me is I think is probably
 
00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
helpful purchas and does say that that
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
within the due diligence you can you can
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
check for insurance regular insurance
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
and um availability and cost of flood
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
and please talk into the microphone
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
sorry our purchase and sale does say
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
that have two separate lines one for
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
just regular property insurance and a
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
second line for checking on the
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
availability and the cost of flood
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
insurance okay so that but that's
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
something you guys have in your document
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
but it's not statutorily required ired
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
like we do now
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
so it's okay but there are I guess there
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
are purchase sell agreements out there
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
that might not actually be you know
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
through the Realtors so we want we want
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
to use whatever you did there that
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
concept other words we're we're not
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
forcing you to do something you're not
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
already doing but we want it to have it
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
written in the statute does that feel
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that represent m a
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
quick question shouldn't this language
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
also be in the uh disclosure form as
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
well as the purchase we don't care at
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
this point we yes whatever they put in
 
00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
the disclosure fir because that that's
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
what got us in the problem in the first
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
place because it had I don't know right
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not statuto we're not
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
modeling around in that disclosure form
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
that disclosure form is theirs and we're
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
not you know all our statute is
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
477 and what we want needs to be in 477
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
and 477 affects purchase and S so that's
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
not that's not complicated anymore more
 
00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
than than we need
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
to okay so where we are
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
at is they're going to quickly knowing
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
what we have just asked for get this
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
done in a couple of
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
hours and then and then we can get it
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
out to everybody and then we'll keep
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
processing it so what I will be doing is
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
is I will be scheduling a
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee tomorrow morning at
 
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
9:30 so that we
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
will what's
 
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
that so right now what we're talking
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
about is working from this amendment
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
right because I assume nobody has
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
problems with this being in the statute
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
okay but we're adding another paragraph
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
amendment we're adding another paragraph
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
to this amendment that's going to say
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be Roman numeral five and
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be short and sweet
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
about everything you ever want want to
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
they right
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
correct okay does everybody feel
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that and that goes in
 
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
section 12 yes section 12 correct
 
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.789 align:start position:0%
section 12 yes section 12 correct
purchase

00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
sale could we just hear representative
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
Ms on that again
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
elegant I'm I'm I'm fine with um you
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
know providing some language that
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
educates people
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
about uh the need for flood
 
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
insurance and um the need to consult the
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
um and I think it really is important to
 
00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
say the official
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
um the official maps for the
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
community um as a a way to start
 
00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:08.309 align:start position:0%
community um as a a way to start
educating

00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
people okay and then we can go from
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
year excuse me and I'll be here I know
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
you will who is going to be responsible
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
for getting this amendment drawn up I
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
will okay
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
so okay well we'll say we'll say the
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will be at
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
11:30 and what we we could do yeah put
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
it get it in 11:30 and then we if I
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
assume the ex session might be done if
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
not we and then and then then she'll
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
then you'll need to say you need another
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
EXA uh exact session at at at
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
session on this bill would be at
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
11:45 yeah let's do
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
that no thank you for catching me on
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Liquor Commission division of
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing the amendment
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
and Bill really before you uh deals
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
directly with contract brewing and or
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
contract manufacturing and tenant
 
01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:40.069 align:start position:0%
contract manufacturing and tenant
manufacturing

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
um contract
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturing uh specifically is that
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
that you have a recipe to make a product
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
um and you give it to another
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that other manufacturer
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
makes that product for you very simply
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
put under tenant Manufacturing
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
is that you have a recipe you go into
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else's facility and make your
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
product using their
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
equipment so this bill expands what uh
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
expands what historically was for the
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
Brewers to make Beverages and beer is
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
expanding it out to Wine and Liquor wine
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and liquor manufacturers
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
as well uh we worked very diligently
 
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.480 align:start position:0%

subcommittee um we had decided that we

my question is this I I was basically
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
not enthusiastic about this bill until I
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
read that an amendment I think or part
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
of it that said that the the patient
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
could refuse it does this not that's
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
still that's in the current bill correct
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay that's one right okay then
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%

interim study was the right decision
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
previously um it was this is one of the
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
most complex bills that we've dealt with
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
um I think I need a biosimilar of some
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
sort myself right now to correct the
 
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
sickness um but given the complexity of
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
this issue and given that the sponsor
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
himself sent out a nice FDA guidance a
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
subset of the FDA guidance just
 
01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.430 align:start position:0%
subset of the FDA guidance just
yesterday

01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
the FDA specifically
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
says that it supports legislation that
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
will classify biosimilars as substit as
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
substitutable with the reference
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
biologic but not with other
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
biosimilars which is what this bill aims
 
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
to do right this bill specifically and
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
I'll just quote the guidance for you the
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
quote the guidance says quote FDA is
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
seeking to amend section 351 of the P
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
Public Health Service Act that's the
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
thing that licens licenses biosimilars
 
01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
to no longer include a separate
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
statutory standard for determination of
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
interchangeable interchangeability and
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
to and to deem all approved biosimilars
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
to be interchangeable with their
 
01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
respective reference products and that's
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
the key part of this and that's where
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
our law difference with different
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
differs and it is an absolute difference
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a distinction it is a
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
difference a difference difference so
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
our our law on the top of page
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
two says regardless of the other issues
 
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
with this which are also complex our law
 
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
says that we want to allow something
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
that the FDA just cleared up doesn't
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
happen either here in any state or even
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
in Europe and they mention Europe
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
specifically in that guidance on the
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
second page of that guidance right below
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
what I just read you so I guess the
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
question before the committee is do we
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
want to do something that even the FDA
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
isn't suggesting that no other country
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
no other state suggests
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
and then separately the whole host of
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
other issues that we haven't studied
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
which is maybe it will reduce cost which
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
would be a great thing and I'm all for
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
it I'm for studying and finding a way to
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
do that but there is also a real
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
possibility that you'll be switched by
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
your pharmacist to an off formulary
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
medication that is a higher cost it's
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
just that simple we're giving the
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
pharmacist the power to do something
 
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
they don't currently have right now
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacists can can be prescribers if
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
and only if they have a collaborative
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
practice agreement just like a PA
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
functions under a doctor it's the same
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
thing and I I didn't make that up we got
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
it straight from the professor of
 
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy practice at Mass College of
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy that's our law so if we want to
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
put in statute A variation on the way
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
pharmacists currently practice
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
essentially expanding their practice and
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
actually giving them legal protection
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
for something that could go wrong
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
without studying it that's what we would
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
be doing and I think there's enough
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
issues cost safety it's great that we
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that says the patient
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
can refuse the patient can refuse any
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
drug any prescription now we they can
 
01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
already do that and I think a lot of
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
patients who are in extremis and dealing
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
with cancer and dealing with tough
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
things I hope that all of us would call
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
our doctors but I'm not so sure that
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
every person dealing with cancer or if
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
the patient would even be there at the
 
01:12:00.629 --> 01:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
time of dispensing that's the other
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
issue so there's just a lot of issues
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
with this we made the correct motion
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
before let's stay focus on we made the
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
correct motion before it was unanimous
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
50 itm study we've had lots of
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
information come before then and some of
 
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
it made it imminently clear that even
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
the FDA doesn't recommend what this bill
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
does so I'd ask you just to vote down
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
reconsideration representative
 
01:12:24.159 --> 01:12:27.310 align:start position:0%
reconsideration representative
spear

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
no we're talking about
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
talk specific we're talking about a very
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
very small subset of biosimilar drugs
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
that have gone through further testing
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
with switching studies the switching
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
studies are
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
extensive and druggists are allowed to
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
switch those with the formulary right
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
now because they've been designated as
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosimilars and that's a
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
small handful of drugs
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
we received a number of studies when we
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
were in this committee last time showing
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
how these were very safe we received
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
those studies from Europe and we receiv
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
received studies from uh some other
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee members that came in from
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
other you know like uh representative
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
Lon and her and her husband Dr
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
leyon and I went through those and I'm
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
sure everybody else had the opportunity
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
to go through those as well and as a
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
result of that it became very clear that
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
there are alternatives to the uh Rising
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
drug prices that we face and that this
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
bill gives us an opportunity to take
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
advantage of that for the very small
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
subset of drugs that have been gone
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
through switching studies they don't
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
have that designation switching studies
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
is not a designation they have in Europe
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
so they don't use it uh we received
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh some comments against this they were
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
conjecture they were opinion they did
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
not have the proof that we had that was
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
supporting this
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill the other problem the other thing
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
is we received uh support from the New
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society AARP nscl the
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
US Congress I have found support this
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
kind of an idea and are thinking about
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
writing a bill for it Medicare pbms and
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy associations of the
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
national and state
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
level we've been strangled over the
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
years by what we've been told drug
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
companies can do what we been told what
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacy can do New Hampshire has in the
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
past done some Innovative things with
 
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
drug laws and I with uh insurance
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
requirements this is a way that we can
 
01:14:42.189 --> 01:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
give them a little tool it's Tool It's a
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
small tool that they can use to start to
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
begin to bring down drug prices and I
 
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
think it's very important that we take
 
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of this tiny little step and
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
go with it the uh the idea that we need
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
to study it some more there isn't
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
anything left to study we've seen 15
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
years of studies coming out of Europe
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
where they're interchanging drugs all
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
over the place we've seen 15 years of
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
Japan changing drugs it's time for us to
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
take that little step and I believe that
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
we have to do
 
01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:14.250 align:start position:0%
this for
 
01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:16.510 align:start position:0%
this for

[Music]
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
governor thank you um I guess I I have
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
two points um which are I think fairly
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps simplistic um in reference to
 
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
the FDA guidance my understanding is
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
that things that are equal to the same
 
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
thing are equal to each other that is
 
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.709 align:start position:0%
thing are equal to each other that is
that

01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:37.719 --> 01:15:39.390 align:start position:0%
that

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
um drug a is a biosimilar to drug B and
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
Drug C is a biosimilar to drug B sorry
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
if drug B is biosimilar to drug a and
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
Drug C is biosimilar to drug a then drug
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
drug B would be a biosimilar to drug C
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
and therefore they should all be
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
interchangeable that was how how I
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
understood it the second thing is in
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
reference to the pharmacy possibly
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
switching uh a lower cost to a higher
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
cost biosimilar it is always possible to
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
ask the pharmacist at the time of
 
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
dispensing what would be the cost of an
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
alternative formulation and I know this
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
is possible and I know that they answer
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
honestly because I have done this um and
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
found for instance that there was a
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
difference between something that would
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
cost $300 a month something that would
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
cost $1,100 a month uh which obviously
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
was a huge difference um so I think
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
with yes if I recall correctly would New
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire be the first state to enact
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
this type of leg evidently to represent
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
M says yes would be
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
is there a way that we could request
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
require some type of an evaluation after
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
say a one or a twoyear period to
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
determine you know what is the cost
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
savings if there were any issues because
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
if this is model legislation for other
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
states I'm sure they would want to
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
understand what our lived experience
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
would be so we could um add a sunset to
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
the statute and which would cause it to
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's a sunset it's just
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
some type of a does what it has the the
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
effect of is having done uh a public
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
hearing process and and then decided
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
that you know whether this is approprate
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
and that's really you you remember the
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
pandas that that's really pandas was
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
sunset that was a five-year Sunset so
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
that after a period of time then you can
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
pause and and and uh in the public
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
hearing uh then people would have to
 
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
bring in and show that there was you
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
know what the good the bad and the ugly
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
I guess so that is a possibility we
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
could add a sunset fairly Cutting Edge
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
for state to do it it is something
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
different we're you know we're the
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
objective is to help patients and reduce
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
cost I would definitely like to see if
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're meeting those objectives okay so
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
somehow we're right now we're we're the
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh okay the right we're we're on the
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
still on the reconsideration motion
 
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
aren't we okay so that it right now
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to decide whether
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
reconsider but that is uh something
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
another option yes represent a couple
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
comments were made about it could cause
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
a high an increase in drugs we have a
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
thing in here that says specifically
 
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
that they can only be offered if it
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
reduces the price they had to be a
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
reduced price correct so at least that
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
part of it that's already took care the
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
cost issue is already addressed minute
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
so um okay so the motion is to
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
reconsider and the uh so we have hunt M
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
brelli Burrows G
 
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
and spear all those in favor of
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
reconsidering raise your hand one two
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
three four five all those opposed so
 
01:19:05.629 --> 01:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
five to one
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously this bill has to go on to
 
01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.350 align:start position:0%
um obviously this bill has to go on to
the

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
Senate and you know and and if uh
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative migu is you know is
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
convinced of his of of the logic of his
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
argument then I think he he could
 
01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
certainly present it to the senate in
 
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
terms of adding a sunset to it I don't
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
know you know I mean I I I don't know I
 
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
mean I I would I would
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
assume that if if the FDA if knowing
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
that we pass it let's say we do pass it
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
and I assume the FDA will become aware
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
that we passed it that if they think
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
there was a problem then they they they
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
have abilities to take quick action and
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
and basically shut us down if they
 
01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.229 align:start position:0%
and basically shut us down if they
thought

01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
you know to say oh this is you know
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
wildly successful or beyond our
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
expectations or these are I know who
 
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
would do that that's the problem who who
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
would I don't like the insurance comp
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
the that's Department of Insurance I've
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
always treated this bill as an insurance
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
bill okay why did it come to us it is
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
true that re representative Merchant the
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor is from the Health and Human
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
Service committee and he assured me that
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
all his committee members are okay with
 
01:20:25.629 --> 01:20:25.639 align:start position:0%
this bill okay so I take that for for
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
what it's worth so at this point U I
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
have I have not had any health in inate
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
anybody in the health system say that
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with this
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
bill and and yes all the insurance
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
companies think that if it's going to
 
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
lower lower cost to the consumer then
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
then that's a good idea so that's that
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
point where I was originally willing to
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
interim study it because of the of of
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
the nature of being so unknown and the
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
presentation we had at the time the
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
movement of the committee was to to
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
interim study it um obviously um in
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
hindsight and we you know so maybe said
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we we were a little rushed to
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
judgment on that interim study and I'm
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm comfortable with going ahead and
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
and passing this bill okay all right so
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
there's no way to issue a report it's
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
the sunset yeah well the best way to
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
that will happen is representative MCU
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
will do his research and he'll come in
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
and bring in a repeal B
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
and I I think probably next year you can
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill in regards to what you
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
want to see or kind of study you would
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
see yeah yeah it could certainly bring
 
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.270 align:start position:0%
see yeah yeah it could certainly bring
in

01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
another exactly now you get the
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
problem okay all right so uh we have a
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
mo representative who would like to
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
represent a spear seconded by
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves up to pass on
 
01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.149 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves up to pass on
the

01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
amendment amendment
 
01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.430 align:start position:0%
amendment amendment
number

01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
1028 okay any discussion on the on the
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
amendment all those in favor of the
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
amendment please say I I one two three
 
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
four five those
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
opposed that's unfortunate that means
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
you don't care about the position being
 
01:22:19.639 --> 01:22:21.229 align:start position:0%
you don't care about the position being
notified

01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
notified
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
okay just for the record I'd like them
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
to be notified in advance and I I talked
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
to you about that and the amendment
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that representative spear
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
second by representative hunt moves
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
amended oh wait minut there's another
 
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
line I have to do another I'll do it
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay I'll get it I'll get you just
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
just just do a little circle you know
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
little arrows and say this is I'll do
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
that after okay okay so spere oh I see
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
because you see right because we did the
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right um any discussion on
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
the motion of about to pass as
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
amended was it an was it an amendment
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
that said at no additional cost or was
 
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
that in the original bill that was in
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
the original
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
bill I thought that was an amendment for
 
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
some that was in the original I I was I
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
was thinking I need an amendment then I
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
realized reading the bill it was already
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
there where where is it uh I'm looking
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
at it now okay well it's there
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
I saw a Redline amendment that I had an
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendment but it turns out that was
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it was already in the bill
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
so it was in a section arounded I think
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
I I where I don't have the bill in front
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
of me but you really we really want to
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
see it and know about it okay I don't
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
think it I don't think it says it so who
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
who it it was an interested party
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.440 --> 01:24:23.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
hi I have an email from rep Merchant
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
about we've had so many amendments I
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
can't tell any
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
thought I read the did there was a red
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
line amendment that had saw I that
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:32.709 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
even if it even if it doesn't as I said
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
earlier um it's very easy for the
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
customer to guard against
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.239 --> 01:26:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
myself

01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
and that was a concern that HHS
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
committee members had including rep
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
kofalt in
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.189 --> 01:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
committee guess we're going to be here
 
01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow afternoon
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
now can
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
believe could I could I pull the rest of
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
the committee real quick does
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
anyone second substitution performed
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
okay dispens not sure which one he may
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
use in the which would be earlier than
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
the three days in the current law so
 
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
this is something new well that's what
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
he was expecting but that the pharmacist
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
had to inform the prescriber at the time
 
01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.030 align:start position:0%
had to inform the prescriber at the time
of

01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
dispensing so was that's not in the bill
 
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
amendment this is something else when a
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
pharmacist dispenser which the
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacist inform the patient and the
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
prescri and the prescri found it days
 
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.629 align:start position:0%
prescri and the prescri found it days
found

01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
found
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
it not sure which one he may use and be
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
earlier than the three days in the
 
01:27:37.199 --> 01:27:39.030 align:start position:0%
earlier than the three days in the
current

01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
law okay the current yeah the
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
current the current
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
law oh I see what you're saying okay so
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
he's saying
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that I need a copy of this bill this is
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
why I hate not having the file here in
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
front of me nobody has the paper copy I
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't I hate looking electronically I'm
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I I need if I'm going to make an
 
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
CP not a place I want to
 
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:17.550 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.510 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
you

01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
okay the original bill says inform the
 
01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:24.629 align:start position:0%
okay the original bill says inform the
patient

01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
two um it's page two Roman numeral 4
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's what's in the current law up here
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
4 which is what we're amending when a
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacist dispenses an ining biological
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
product for the prescriber or biolog the
 
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacist or his neodestiny shall
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
inform the patient and then the
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
amendment says and the prescriber but it
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't give a time but the three days
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
to me the three days was the filing
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
electronic filing of the
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
prescription so I you know he's to me
 
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
he's confusing the
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
situation when if by saying that okay
 
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
but we could add so if we take out the
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have in front of
 
01:29:14.669 --> 01:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
us okay we take out the am the
 
01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist B for the
 
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.590 align:start position:0%
pharmacist B for the
prescrib

01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
prescrib
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
um the pharmacist and H shall inform the
 
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh um at the time time
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
of the dispensing when a pharmacist at
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.149 --> 01:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
time uh no because that's a whole
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
process the delay right and that means
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
the the patient won't get their medicine
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
as quickly as they would like to so
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
we're we are not going to worry about
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
that because the pharmacist is that the
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
patient the pharmacist has an obligation
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
to notify the the prescriber and if the
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
prescriber you says this is a bad idea
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
the prescriber can then take action call
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
they can call the patient and say don't
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
take it think there anyway
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
send okay no so here's the problem the
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
problem is you're opposed to this bill
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
so to say that you're trying to
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
negotiate in good faith you would have
 
01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
to convince me that you're negotiating
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
it to make this a better build so that
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
you are ready to vote for it but if
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
you're never going to vote for it I'm
 
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
kind of tuning out what you're saying
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
you please talk into the mic oh yeah so
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
sorry what I think would make it way
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
more reasonable that I could even
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
support is if we tell the prescriber in
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
advance and I think there's an
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the typical work scenario
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
I get a prescription from my doctor they
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
transmit it electronically I'm usually
 
01:31:02.669 --> 01:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
not very often not not usually standing
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
at the pharmacist ready to take it
 
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
across the counter okay they either
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes these types of drugs they
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
usually have to order these complicated
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
ones do you have the amendment uh that
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
he had done ahead of time uh probably
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
it's probably in it's in my email sure
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
and I I'm pretty much against doing that
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
because for the reasons you said I'm I'm
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
against doing that too because it's
 
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
timing it's a timing problem so but
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
right now what I'm want is this where we
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
put it in that it was going to be for
 
01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:35.790 align:start position:0%
put it in that it was going to be for
less

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
money no it was in an amendment I we
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
there were there was actually several
 
01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.350 align:start position:0%
there were there was actually several
amendments

01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:52.830 align:start position:0%
amendments

01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
spear New Hampshire has always been uh a
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
supportive of new ways to reduce the
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
cost of insurance coverage for the
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
prescriber and this is really an
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
excellent opportunity for us to find
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
finally make a dent with respect to the
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
coverage for drugs so as far as the
 
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are concerned this
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
is a win and as far as the prescribers
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
that are concerned this is a win so I
 
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
I'm very encouraged by the fact that
 
01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to take this first step and
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
be very Innovative in this area as we
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
have been in other areas of legislation
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
that this committee has taken up so I
 
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
OTP a
 
01:42:54.159 --> 01:42:58.300 align:start position:0%
OTP a
tpaa

01:42:58.300 --> 01:42:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:43:03.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
amended and amended twice just for
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
clarification all right is the question
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
clear representing you one more time
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so I still think inm study is the
 
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
best thing I'm glad we passed the
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it clear that it won't
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
increase cost to the consumer
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there is no such thing as
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
a study to sub one interchangeable for
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
another so that's a misnomer I hope the
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
blurb doesn't say that because that'd be
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
misinformation and the bill is really
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
not about drug costs right there's a lot
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
of ways to lower drug costs um
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
prescriber may win pharmacist may win
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
patient loses support interim study
 
01:43:43.629 --> 01:43:43.639 align:start position:0%
that'll be the Minority Report which you
 
01:43:43.639 --> 01:43:44.750 align:start position:0%
that'll be the Minority Report which you
already

01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.109 align:start position:0%
already
have

01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh any more discussion on the
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%

01:45:55.629 --> 01:45:55.639 align:start position:0%
window already open well there's two two
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%

01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.840 --> 01:47:01.870 align:start position:0%

01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:05.719 align:start position:0%
okay all right so um the amendment of
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1296 that's in front of you

01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
what we do with um any health insurance
 
01:47:18.589 --> 01:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
mandate is uh because that's when really
 
01:47:23.709 --> 01:47:23.719 align:start position:0%
begin the process of new uh contracts uh
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
go out um
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
motion happy to move out the pass I will
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
make the motion
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.030 align:start position:0%
 
1133

01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
1133
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
Burrows okay so uh motion is made in
 
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
second is there any discussion on the
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
motion see none uh this is the health
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee okay all those in favor say I
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
six okay um I'll make the motion about
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
to pass as
 
01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:28.669 align:start position:0%
to pass as
amended

01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.149 --> 01:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
um you recognize to speak to my motion
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
um so the reason why I'm making this
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
motion is I'm going to make sure in the
 
01:48:39.149 --> 01:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
blurb in the excuse me I'm not supposed
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
to say that in the committee report is
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
to make clear that the committee
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
intention with this bill is in terms of
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
passing it is that this test this
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
machine this special machine is being
 
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
done because the the mamography that we
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
do mandate
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
now is is is uh unclear and that they
 
01:49:03.149 --> 01:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
need to to have another exam and that
 
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're uh we're waving the
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
deductible and copays U because this is
 
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
really a followup to that mamogram
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
test okay so the motion is ought to pass
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
as amended any
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor say I 1 2
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
3 4 5 six six those opposed
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
go okay so I only have two
 
01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:39.910 align:start position:0%
go okay so I only have two
left

01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.589 --> 01:49:44.599 align:start position:0%

away
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
I guess I should have done that one
 
01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:57.310 align:start position:0%
I guess I should have done that one
first

01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%

01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
is defined elsewhere in the bill
 
01:51:49.229 --> 01:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
um in the definition
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
section it's Roman numeral uh 2 eight
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to be in the current
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
in the current bill that's in the bill
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
the original bill so you're going to
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
pull up the original
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
Bill the internet's a little slow in
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
this corner of the
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
building that's it up there is do we
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the original B uh you
 
01:52:13.229 --> 01:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
were given one months ago yes I don't
 
01:52:14.589 --> 01:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
know where it
 
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
is pulled up the
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
original I do do you want to go sit next
 
01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
to her and and not necessarily
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
I should have brought my computer
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
because I've got I got it in my computer
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have original bill in there for him
 
01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.990 align:start position:0%
we have original bill in there for him
oral

01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
oral
 
01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
bill I already read it yesterday so uh
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
all 32 Pages
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes yeah most of it's boiler plate but
 
01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:46.109 align:start position:0%
 
business

01:52:46.109 --> 01:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
thanks well I'm glad you're interested
 
01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.550 align:start position:0%
thanks well I'm glad you're interested
in

01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
something yeah this is been
 
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
big deal for
 
01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.790 align:start position:0%
big deal for
me

01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
okay so what does it say for store value
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
and and if you had now that you had the
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
original what what page is that is that
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
on in the original bill it's on page
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.990 --> 01:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
nine so I see uh where am I at here oh
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
you're at okay there's something called
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
so page one on line 27 there's closed
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
loop stored value closed loop stored
 
01:53:29.709 --> 01:53:29.719 align:start position:0%
value is different
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
than on page
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
one yeah definition yeah what is what is
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
closed Loops door value what that page
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
five has stored value right so you have
 
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
you have two you have the closed loop
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then separately you got some
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
splaining to do here stored
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
difference well admitted it's been a
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
little while since I looked at these
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
definitions we'll give you
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
explained is it proper for me to ask why
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh we have this legislation to begin
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
with okay yes I can answer that question
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
so um we actually had had heads up about
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
this last
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
year that this legislation was coming
 
01:54:36.189 --> 01:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
down the pike and that um we're
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
we had already taken care of getting rid
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
of uh the the licensing of ATM machines
 
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you remember that those
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
are all it's all of this this is like
 
01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
this is a recodification of a whole
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
business uh of our of
 
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
our they call you money transmitters but
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's really our what what would you call
 
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
this department this is the um of the
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
bank Department what division is this in
 
01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
this would be Consumer Credit division
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
Consumer Credit division that's what I
 
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
was looking for yeah okay there it goes
 
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
right there in the
 
01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.589 align:start position:0%
right there in the
title

01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
title
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay so the consumer credit division
 
01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
because the banking Department not only
 
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
regulates Banks but then we can regulate
 
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
Consumer Credit so this can go all to
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
Consumer Credit includes you you know
 
01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:23.229 align:start position:0%
Consumer Credit includes you you know
small

01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
loans and payday loans
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
even uh you know all those different
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
divisions so then uh in that division in
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
that thing we we have been uh somewhat
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
working around the issue of the um that
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
was also in this division was
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
technically your crypto was some was
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
actually had got dabbled in here because
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
it was considered a commodity but more
 
01:55:50.069 --> 01:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
importantly was um money transmitters
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
what is the issue of if you I go to the
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
old Western Union but I got I flunk the
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
Western Union test when I was trying to
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
send money to my daughter so I just went
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
down to my local
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
Walmart and they tell you which Walmart
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
do you want to send the money to and
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
instantly I sending money to my daughter
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
who was in San Francisco it was a Marvel
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
but yes that there those money
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
transmitters are
 
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
regulated under the section are there
 
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
different types of so wanted to pull the
 
01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:24.109 align:start position:0%
different types of so wanted to pull the
thing

01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:56:24.119 --> 01:56:26.350 align:start position:0%
thing
closer

01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
closer
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
um there are obviously a lot of
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
different uh versions of of money
 
01:56:35.229 --> 01:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
transmission or the reasons for money
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
transmission and I noticed in the
 
01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
1241 uh there
 
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
is uh section
 
01:56:48.189 --> 01:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
four for purposes of this section A
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
license C that issues proprietary
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency non-fungible tokens or
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
other digital assets shall not include
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
the value of such assets when
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
calculating tangible net
 
01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
worth and I explained that to you well I
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
did you like my explanation you made a
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
stab at it I I uh you're calling me
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
making a stabin no I was very
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward that the banking
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
department when you're being regulated
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
by the banking Department we want your
 
01:57:19.229 --> 01:57:19.239 align:start position:0%
balance sheet right and we are going to
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
go over that balance sheet with a fine
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
tooth comb right right and if you think
 
01:57:27.629 --> 01:57:27.639 align:start position:0%
that you can write in Goodwill or some
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
other uh intangible value such as oh we
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
issued these these crypto coins and
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
they're worth $100 and we issued you
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
know a thousand of them so I'm going to
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
put a million dollars into my balance
 
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
sheet they're going to
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
say we are going to disregard that and
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
there's a few more sentences that follow
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
I'm just cutting it cutting it making it
 
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
short for purposes of calculating net
 
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
worth under this section yes
 
01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency non-fungible tokens or
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
other digital assets shall be considered
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
quote proprietary quote but if when such
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
assets are developed or created by the
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
licensed entity exactly so we're talking
 
01:58:13.229 --> 01:58:13.239 align:start position:0%
about the creation of a currency no do
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
not confuse us with digital
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
mining no I'm not confusing it with
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
mining or digital mining or otherwise
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
nothing in this parag graph shall
 
01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
prevent a licensed entity from including
 
01:58:29.069 --> 01:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
the reasonable value of cryptocurrency
 
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
non-fungible tokens or other digital
 
01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
assets developed or created by other
 
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:37.639 align:start position:0%
entities and held as assets when
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
calculating tangible net worth is
 
01:58:47.709 --> 01:58:47.719 align:start position:0%
this has this particular
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
section been always been uh uh regulated
 
01:58:55.709 --> 01:58:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
Department the short the short answer is
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
no um and that's it's been added as part
 
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
of the the model act in response to
 
01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:05.950 align:start position:0%
of the the model act in response to
specific

01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
instances that uh the dep departments
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
seen on the national sphere with regard
 
01:59:16.069 --> 01:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
to uh crypto firms and inflated values
 
01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
of tokens in so far as they affect the
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
balance sheet and the reason that was
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
added in this case was because the
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
Department's trying
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
to uh provide some protection to
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
consumers in instances where there are
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
Bad actors um like FTX that's really the
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
the biggest one that we've seen there
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
are a couple others I think where
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
similar issues have Arisen but that's
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
what this particular paragraph is
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
designed to uh protect against does the
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
bank have any estimation of how
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
much cryptocurrency
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
uh and and also uh changing
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency for dollars etc etc has
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
the banking Department done any study
 
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
that would indicate how much of this
 
02:00:08.109 --> 02:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
activity would be done in New
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if this became laws as written
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
as as you know recommended
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
here I guess I'm are you asking how much
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
money transmission is being done or
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's two different questions
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
you're asking if if you want to ask is
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
how much money transmitting that's going
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
on between turning currency into Bitcoin
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
different currencies and it has nothing
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
to do with this section of the bill this
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
section of the bill is solely about the
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
solvent solvency of the financial
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
institution that is being licensed it
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with what they do for
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
a business okay and that's what you're
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
asking is a separate question question
 
02:00:55.629 --> 02:00:55.639 align:start position:0%
your separate question is how much
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
activity is going on between uh
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
translating taking Bitcoin or excuse me
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's a brand name but taking for
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
instance Bitcoin
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
to fiduciary
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
currency I have another question which
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
follows on that if you're going to
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
regulate something uh you become
 
02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for it and you mentioned as
 
02:01:22.270 --> 02:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact protecting the uh under
 
02:01:26.109 --> 02:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
the consumer affairs routine um do you
 
02:01:28.830 --> 02:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
have any idea do you have the
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh to
 
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
actually regulate um what could be a
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar industry in New
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh yes uh and I say that
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
because we currently do
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
um the exemptions that exist for money
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
transmission related to cryptocurrency
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
they're not changing so
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
the entities that we regulate and
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
oversee in theory won't change at all
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
with the passage of this of this bill
 
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
this is designed to uh make the
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh scheme more efficient and
 
02:02:11.069 --> 02:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
easier for the Department to coordinate
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
with other states on a nationwide basis
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so all right I'm I'm
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll go with that the other my my
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
next question is then why why are we
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
saying these things in writing what is
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
the current uh regulatory
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
environment that you are are working
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
under well this section as
 
02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative hunt said relating to the
 
02:02:38.589 --> 02:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
balance sheet and how the the assets and
 
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
liabilities are calculated we don't have
 
02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
standards for that part of it in the
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
current money transmitter law so the the
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
model act has what are called credential
 
02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
standards for um net worth permissible
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
Investments that sort of thing and this
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
is just one sort of subset of that so
 
02:03:01.229 --> 02:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
that's a new addition um this this
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
section that you're referring there
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
could you define the word proprietary
 
02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:07.510 align:start position:0%
could you define the word proprietary
for

02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
me in in this context what it's designed
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
to to capture are
 
02:03:18.669 --> 02:03:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh cryptocurrencies tokens Etc
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
electronic assets that are created or
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
developed inhouse so if I'm a company
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
token I can't
 
02:03:39.069 --> 02:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
then essentially what we've seen create
 
02:03:41.229 --> 02:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
a value for that and put it on my
 
02:03:43.709 --> 02:03:43.719 align:start position:0%
balance sheet as an asset because what
 
02:03:46.069 --> 02:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
happens is the company would then have
 
02:03:46.079 --> 02:03:47.189 align:start position:0%
happens is the company would then have
an

02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
overinflated uh value and so consumers
 
02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the public think it's worth a lot
 
02:03:55.390 --> 02:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
more than maybe it is and so this is
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
designed to kind of bring that trust in
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
the balance sheet and the enity uh back
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
has it has to be publicly traded it has
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
to be that there's other other
 
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
third-party people have actually done
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
something with that that product and
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
said yeah you know that the value you
 
02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
have on it is a free and open market in
 
02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
other words it needed to be on the New
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
York Stock
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
Exchange so that that is a publicly
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
traded but if you just go and you know
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
print paper on your you know on your
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
computer you print paper and say all of
 
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
a sudden this this Paper Stock and this
 
02:04:34.549 --> 02:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
stock is worth you know $100,000 per
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
piece no if nobody is going to pay you
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for it then it's not it's not
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
legitimate it's it's proprietary well
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
you you can say when bitcoin's value is
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
it's right on the ticker in the New York
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
Stock Exchange that's correct so so the
 
02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
so the crypto has transactional value
 
02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
correct the problem is if you're going
 
02:04:59.310 --> 02:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
to go and use it as collateral for a
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
loan of some sort then you have to uh
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
then you have to do it in dollars or I I
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
would think and and I the end of the day
 
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
is the value is only as good as the
 
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
other person treat FS that has value
 
02:05:19.069 --> 02:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
well you're GNA I would I I would ref I
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
would reference what Bitcoin is going
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
for or ethereum or some whatever that is
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
these these things are actually uh
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
already costed out so it's not a matter
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
of again the costing out is because it's
 
02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.390 align:start position:0%
of again the costing out is because it's
publicly

02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
traded not because they just created
 
02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
inhouse and gave its own proprietary
 
02:05:44.109 --> 02:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
in-house value that's the
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
difference you want to try yeah go ahead
 
02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:49.719 align:start position:0%
ke Mr chairman may I try to clarify this
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
from my own understanding uh is it it
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
along the same questioning that he is
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're saying it's it's
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
clarifying hope hopefully to be sure
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
that I understand the same the answer to
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
the same issue okay okay if I am a LIC
 
02:06:07.629 --> 02:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
if if I own a company that's a licensed
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
entity and we create some cryptocurrency
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
and assign it a particular value and
 
02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
issue it we can't count that as part of
 
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
our tangible net worth but if my my
 
02:06:24.669 --> 02:06:24.679 align:start position:0%
company owns some
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
assets owns some cryptocurrency as
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
assets and that cryptocurrency has not
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
been issued by my company but rather by
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
some other company and has some market
 
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
value then we can count that as part of
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
our tangible net worth have I understood
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
that correctly that is exactly right
 
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
you okay Keith all right so I I uh I I
 
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
like language that you guys came up with
 
02:06:56.669 --> 02:06:56.679 align:start position:0%
for the proprietary aspect um so I have
 
02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
no issue with that that makes perfect
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
sense you know I could create a million
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
tokens sell it to one person for a,
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
dollar for one token and all of a sudden
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
I have a billion dollar market cap for
 
02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
my asset that no one else values right
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
so right that would be a bad actor we
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
want to keep them out of our economy um
 
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to go back to that stored
 
02:07:20.109 --> 02:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
value uh definition I just want to make
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
sure we're not in inadvertently pulling
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
in Virtual currency into that stored
 
02:07:27.069 --> 02:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
value definition because that would sort
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
of defeat the whole purpose of exempting
 
02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:31.719 align:start position:0%
it uh which we did originally back in
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
2017 so yes what why don't you read us
 
02:07:36.510 --> 02:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
what the definition of stored value is
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple pieces of it before
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
you do
 
02:07:42.549 --> 02:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
um it says uh sword value means monetary
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
value representing a claim against the
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
issuer evidenced by an electronic or
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
digital record and that is intended and
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
accepted for use as a means of
 
02:07:52.549 --> 02:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
redemption for money or monetary value
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
or payment for goods or services so it
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
says it's electronic or could be
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
electronic and then it says the term
 
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
includes what is not limited to prepaid
 
02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
access on and on so not the not limited
 
02:08:07.629 --> 02:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
to could pull in anything right so um I
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure it's not
 
02:08:10.549 --> 02:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
inadvertently I know it isn't your
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
intention but it's it's it's the idea of
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
of a credit debit a card that's been
 
02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
pre-loaded with value that's my
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that was my so so the
 
02:08:22.669 --> 02:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
issue is you don't actually
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
say card or account or you don't you
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
don't kind of limit in terms because
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
when you have that language is kind of
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
open-ended it it appears that it it goes
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
beyond from what we intended it to be
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
which was the stored value cards because
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
we're using that to take care of the
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
mayor's problem so so maybe add
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
something like uh this does not include
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
virtual currency to Virtual currency
 
02:08:52.830 --> 02:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
transactions because that's really the
 
02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:54.750 align:start position:0%
transactions because that's really the
exemption

02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
there I think that's certainly in line
 
02:08:59.950 --> 02:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
with my understanding of how this works
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
all all said I don't have an issue with
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
adding it I think if I'm looking at this
 
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know with my attorney hat on I would
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
go to the definition of money
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
transmission and then the exemptions uh
 
02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
to as a sort of starting point and the
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
exemption that has been there since
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
2017 uh is still there and that exempts
 
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
the solely and cryptocurrency that I
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
think you're referencing there but if
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's a matter of making paragraph
 
02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
has been there all along yeah so do you
 
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
mind putting that as a bill in for next
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
year well or I can we can amend a bill
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
we do it non doain hearing and add it to
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
another bill I just think if somebody
 
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
from out of state is coming and reading
 
02:09:43.229 --> 02:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
this for the first time they might get
 
02:09:46.109 --> 02:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
the false impression that it includes
 
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
virtual currency so maybe reference the
 
02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
exemption in the definition of stored
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
value in paragraph
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
28 of the original Bill the uh of the
 
02:09:58.510 --> 02:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
original bill right maybe put an
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
explicit reference to the exemption that
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned in that definition
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
that way if somebody's reading it for
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
the first time they're not
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
confused I'm happy to to to do that it
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
be pretty simple okay I mean that's what
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
he's saying right all right so I need
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
that Amendment ASAP so that I can
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday so if you can go home get have
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
that dra up and sent over to me and then
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
we'll get that to legislative Services
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
yep I can do that that makes sense I
 
02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
still have a bunch of questions by the
 
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
way uh well that's St value is uh among
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
them okay so I mean this I I have to uh
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'm an old school dollar guy
 
02:10:48.189 --> 02:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
okay so uh the thing is um stored value
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
means monetary value represented
 
02:10:50.639 --> 02:10:51.830 align:start position:0%
means monetary value represented
representing

02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
representing
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
a claim against the
 
02:10:57.629 --> 02:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
issuer I don't know if you're issuing
 
02:11:00.030 --> 02:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
crypto but uh against the issue
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
evidenced by an electronic or digital
 
02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:05.430 align:start position:0%
evidenced by an electronic or digital
record

02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
so what am I looking at if I'm if I want
 
02:11:11.790 --> 02:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
to see what the real value is and you
 
02:11:15.549 --> 02:11:15.559 align:start position:0%
give me a digital record or some
 
02:11:15.559 --> 02:11:17.589 align:start position:0%
give me a digital record or some
electronic

02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
proprietary uh and
 
02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:22.030 align:start position:0%
proprietary uh and
digital

02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
digital
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
thing and and called the debit card um
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
do you have a debit
 
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
card yeah sure but I mean so that debit
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
card has stored value and the stored
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
value is your bank yeah and that you
 
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
know that how you all you have to do is
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
go online with your bank well I don't do
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
I don't do any business in crypto no
 
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
we're not talking cryp what I'm trying
 
02:11:46.109 --> 02:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
to get at is this crypto business to me
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
is new now we're we're specifically
 
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to put in a in that stored by you
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
that it can't be crypto it can't be that
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
that well I mean the Providence is money
 
02:12:01.149 --> 02:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
laundering so you can take crypto and do
 
02:12:04.229 --> 02:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
dollars Providence that would
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
be but there you are I mean if if if I
 
02:12:12.270 --> 02:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
have a th000 crypto uh coins and on the
 
02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
market they each are worth
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
$3,000 that's real collateral I'm I'm
 
02:12:20.669 --> 02:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
assuming it's going to be taken for real
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
collateral if your financial institution
 
02:12:25.750 --> 02:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
is willing to use that as collateral
 
02:12:27.069 --> 02:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
maybe Donald Trump should know about
 
02:12:29.950 --> 02:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
that because he's had trouble finding I
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure he's he's he probably
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
working on it but the if he had some
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
crypto maybe some people have which is
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
why I asked which is why I asked about
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure at the bank I don't
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
think this is a a minor matter what I
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
know about this
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
issue okay
 
02:12:50.119 --> 02:12:51.830 align:start position:0%
issue okay
was

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
that we have payroll
 
02:12:57.390 --> 02:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
companies that do not issue checks they
 
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
do direct deposit and they they give
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
actually stored value cards am I am I
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
going up the right stored value what
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
cards digital record it's a digital
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
record stored value and so what this was
 
02:13:15.629 --> 02:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
about uh why we even you know that it
 
02:13:19.390 --> 02:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
was always in there but this was it
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
ironically used as one of our exemptions
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
to take so that our small instate
 
02:13:27.629 --> 02:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
payroll companies don't get swallowed up
 
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
with this regulation where the where uh
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
the most famous one is the ADP you know
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
the payroll company is is going to be
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
regulated because they actually issue
 
02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.350 align:start position:0%
regulated because they actually issue
stored

02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
stored
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
value I they they issue a card but they
 
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
had the stored value okay um think
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
stored value means dollars
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
now make a translation for me about all
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
this cryptocurrency business well you're
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
the one who's making that leap no no
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's in it's right here I didn't write
 
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
this thing Keith is is saying is he
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
wants to make sure that with that term
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
store value yeah that we are
 
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
specifically making sure it's not crypto
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
so you should be ecstatic about his
 
02:14:17.229 --> 02:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment because he's clearing it up to
 
02:14:20.109 --> 02:14:20.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that no one ever thinks that
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
crypto can be stor
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
valued he's going to do dollars just
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
like everybody else that's what we want
 
02:14:30.549 --> 02:14:30.559 align:start position:0%
that paragraph to be which was at some
 
02:14:35.470 --> 02:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
at some part of the the chain was
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
crypto you can't get rid of crypto For
 
02:14:38.079 --> 02:14:39.069 align:start position:0%
crypto you can't get rid of crypto For
Heaven's

02:14:39.069 --> 02:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
Heaven's
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
Sake you're looking for regulating here
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I can give you mortgages I mean
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
we can go talk about property and by the
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
way the the Securities and Exchange
 
02:14:54.589 --> 02:14:54.599 align:start position:0%
Commission said crypto is a
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
commodity I just think this is a jumbo I
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how he's I have been
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
saying that by the way to you yeah for
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
the last six years after I would sat
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
through whole summer of those whole
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
hearing about crypto and I have said it
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
once I said it twice I think everybody
 
02:15:14.350 --> 02:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
else in the room has probably heard me
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
say it it is a commodity it is not
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
dollars it does not have Financial value
 
02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
we called it the banking Department
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
called it Beanie Babies yeah that's what
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
it goes remember the Beanie Baby discuss
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
com across the New York it's a commodity
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
and all I know is why I would never do
 
02:15:38.189 --> 02:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
crypto because as someone who his family
 
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
made its money in a
 
02:15:43.109 --> 02:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
commodity I would not want to hold a v
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
something that the value is only with
 
02:15:47.709 --> 02:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
somebody else perceives it to be that
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's a commodity that is not a commodity
 
02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
it has no tangible things it's not
 
02:15:58.030 --> 02:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
aluminum could be
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
plastic okay so I I at this point uh I I
 
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think we really can help you
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
with your answers you feel like you're
 
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
you're chasing your tail and and you
 
02:16:11.549 --> 02:16:11.559 align:start position:0%
know and we understand you I'm just not
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
seeing the need for the business I got
 
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
you fair enough okay so uh you'll work
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
on getting that that Amendment so we're
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we just replace we could
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
just we'll add it as a separate
 
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment because because that stored is
 
02:16:35.469 --> 02:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
that that's not in this amendment now
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
right so just that'll be a second
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
amendment it'll be just so I'm clear
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
just a new Amendment with everything Al
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
together the only thing that amendment
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
is is going to be is that stored what is
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
the RSA the it's it's the definition
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
stored by value and we just want to say
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
I put it some you know saying this does
 
02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:57.270 align:start position:0%
I put it some you know saying this does
not

02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:17:00.270 --> 02:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
include digital reference the exception
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's already there yep so somebody can
 
02:17:05.070 --> 02:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
follow just reference the exception
 
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
yep it's
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
not okay kill that one so at this point
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna uh we'll set this aside
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%

of the
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
room oh what what the amendment for 1129
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:49.719 --> 02:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
 
we

02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:14.349 --> 02:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
um representative Herbert could I have
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
the bill back for the for the file the
 
02:19:25.150 --> 02:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.640 --> 02:20:19.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.319 --> 02:20:47.550 align:start position:0%
 
back

02:20:47.550 --> 02:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
when Senor moment always in the
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
community room but okay I will try my
 
02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:55.030 align:start position:0%
community room but okay I will try my
best

02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
here so um this is uh not that we passed
 
02:21:00.030 --> 02:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
of no This was um it'll come to me and
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
say as soon as I walk out the room the
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
name will come to me
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
um so that what we're going to tr is um
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
this is allowing condominium
 
02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
associations to have proxies because
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
that was the big one of the is issues is
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
is is getting condo members to show up
 
02:21:26.670 --> 02:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
and and the big issue was to clarify
 
02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
that the proxy um it was not a a generic
 
02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
proxy that it had to be it had to be
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
specific the actual votion actual issue
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it had to be up and down and um so
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically this amendment takes care
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
what highly worried about was that we
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
took out time
 
02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:52.550 align:start position:0%
took out time
shares

02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:57.309 --> 02:21:57.319 align:start position:0%
so so um I will to
 
02:21:57.319 --> 02:21:58.950 align:start position:0%
so so um I will to
pass

02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:22:03.389 --> 02:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
yes I'm yeah um if I remember when the
 
02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced it was
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative Aly and representative
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
infantine and representative infantine I
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
think uh was sort of against passing the
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill correct
 
02:22:15.309 --> 02:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
he's he's okay with this amendment that
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
yes and they're looking for people who
 
02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
board God those are like the plague they
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
are okay okay so representative hunt
 
02:22:36.270 --> 02:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
second by representative burough moves
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
to pass on the amendment number not on

these two amendments or whenever the
 
02:25:17.389 --> 02:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
timing of those two amendments and then
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
go back into exact session and and then
 
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll have everything all done
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and then
 
02:25:27.790 --> 02:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
blurbs executive you know committee
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
reports you know
 
02:25:33.269 --> 02:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
remember I am trying to write down this
 
02:25:36.309 --> 02:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
time I have done it you know but I and
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
and other times I I would been a bad boy
 
02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
and wasn't writing names down so but
 
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
we'll try to stay on top part of the
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
problem is I don't always hear who gets
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
a sign so whoever's makes we the the
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
policy been whoever makes the
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
motion and there and there in lies the
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
other problem I don't remember who
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
motion right well that that it's all the
 
02:26:00.670 --> 02:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
more reason why I need to make sure that
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
I have it done I I'll try to I'm going
