we're actually a little bit ahead of
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
schedule I I wasn't sure how long that
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
would take but um um just a couple
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
housekeeping things uh represent the
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
schedule of bills did you already
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
distribute that or no um there not okay
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Leon and I have been
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
spending some time uh trying to lay out
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
a tentative schedule for the committee
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
right now we're looking at Wednesdays to
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
be um starting next Wednesday in fact
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
and obviously those bills will all be
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
noticed and um um you know going forward
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
we'll be working around house session
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
days and so forth I understand there
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
might be a day or two of house session
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
days on Wednesdays also did you want to
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
say something representative um if we're
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
looking at a schedule that will allow us
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
to meet one day a week for committee um
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
that will require us keeping questions
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
limited to the questions that we need to
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
know from people who are coming to
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
present to our committee um as opposed
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
to pontificating with an if I know
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
question by doing that it looks like we
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
can get through these in in a solid
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
pathway um we are looking to sort of
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
block them off the 9:00 group The 10:30
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
group and the 1:00 group so that if we
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
stay on track and um and if something
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't demand longer attention then
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to take a little break
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
before 10:30 and then have a good solid
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
lunch hour but it also will allow us
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
some time if we run into some unexpected
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
issues we won't be cut short and we
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure that we're giving every
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
bill it's due we are looking at doing
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
full days on Wednesdays from 9:00 a.
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
until probably 3:45 345 is opposed to
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
four because I know some people need to
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
leave early because of child care and
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
other family commitments um so that that
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's our goal anyway and and again you
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
know we'll see how how it works and we
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
may get to Bunch times when we may need
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
to revise that and of course everyone
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
will be you know appropriately
 
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
informed with that um I'd like to move
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
on to our first presenter uh Maggie
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.269 align:start position:0%
 
ca

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
ca
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes oh okay thank you I made a I made a
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
circle and I blocked off part of the
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
letter so apologize for
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
that I'm a quick learner um good morning
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for having me
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a little outside the DHHS realm in
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
that I represent all the 10 Community
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers who do the major
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
work of mental health in New Hampshire
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
and have been in mental health and
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health specifically for
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
the last 40 years of my life um
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
currently as the president I'm here to
 
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
do a little foreshadowing with you about
 
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
our cbha agenda for this year with the
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
legislature first and foremost we are
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
looking to close the wage gap between
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
our centers employees because of the
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
workforce crisis our wage Gap is
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
significant when you think about a
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
master's level clinician who works in a
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center making
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
around $60,000 a year which is an
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
admirable salary but if you go to work
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
at the maram county jail as a social
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
worker you'll get 80 and a sign on bonus
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we can't afford and can't compete
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
with so we're we're stuck in a bad place
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
right now so that is our priority is to
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
close the wage Gap cbha is currently
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
meeting with the governor's budget and
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
policy team and legislative budget
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
writers to present the facts and explain
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
the critical need for this increase in
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason its Medicaid rates is
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
because Community Mental Health Centers
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
as the vendor with
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS primarily is funded by Medicaid
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay so most of the 10 centers between
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
60 and 85% of their budget is
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um we appreciated the efforts
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
Last by Anum um whereby we saw an
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
increase twice
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
3.1% um and we are here to say that we
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
need to bring our salaries up to the
 
00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:02.759 align:start position:0%
level of other providers and that the
 
00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:04.759 align:start position:0%
Medicaid underlying fee for Service
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
rates would need to increase to a huge
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
amount right a range of about 21.5 to
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
23% representing 26 to $28 million
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
shortfall in our wages we should be able
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
to agree that New Hampshire needs an
 
00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:23.759 align:start position:0%
adequately funded mental health system
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
not a poorly resourced one because we
 
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
all know what's going on in the world
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
but there are successes that we have
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
accomplished in the last two years we've
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
added 60 additional beds um and we have
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
put up a rapid response team that many
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
of you I'm sure have heard advertised on
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
TV or radio whereby we are helping to
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
meet people in the community who are in
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
crisis and keep them out of the
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
emergency room so that we're not taking
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
up precious bed space and resources and
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
we're able to serve them in crises in
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
their home in their schools wherever
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
they are we also want to emphasize the
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
importance today of Medicaid expansion
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
which needs to be reauthorized this year
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
and is another legislative priority for
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
us data from the division of Medicaid
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
services from Henry and parties say that
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
990,000 New Hampshire residents have
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid of those 11,000 of
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
them have mental health care and 30,000
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
of them use Medicaid services for
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
medication treatment of mental health
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
disorders and there are almost 9,000
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
additional people who take substance use
 
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.790 align:start position:0%
additional people who take substance use
disordered

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
disordered
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
services our Workforce as I noted is a
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
problem across the health care spectrum
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
and you know this access to tella health
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
is important for us to improve and ease
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
the access as well as attract a
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
Workforce our support for housing both
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
for the workforce housing and our
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
patients lessening the administrative
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
burden and bureaucratic burdens as a
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
retention strategy as well in as Improv
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
in Access if a doctor is doing tons of
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
paperwork or a clinician is doing tons
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
of paperwork it's taking time away from
 
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
seeing the patients that they need to
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
see and when we have few of those people
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
around and available we want to make
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
sure that we are decreasing any
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens that we can we
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
are also interested in streamlining
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification requirements
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
for Recruitment and desirability of
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire continued
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
investments will be required for our
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
state loan repayment program which has
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
been very successful for us in terms of
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
recruiting people and keeping people but
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see it expanded to
 
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
bachelor's level
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%

you very much um I'm curious who do you
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
see as your competition in terms of
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
hiring so primarily
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
for-profit um health care providers that
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
are doing substance abuse work hospitals
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
no offense to the guys from over in
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon area but you know when Mary when
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock hospital or Mary Hitchcock as
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
I used to call it um gets a $10,000
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
$20,000 bonus sign on and I'm offering
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
2,000 for a clinician or a nurse I just
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
can't compete so it's other health care
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
providers and if you will richer more
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
resourced Health Care
 
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
Providers um can I ask sure go ahead um
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
my other question had to do with tah
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
health I'm really curious about that
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
what this is going to be a difficult
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
question to answer I assume but what
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
percentage of your care do you see as
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
teleah health where do you see that
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
going in the FI future and what's the
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from that for you so
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
currently the reimbursement is the same
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
as if you were face to face right the
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
federal government did that with the ph
 
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
and it continues um in my neck of the
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
woods which would be your neck of the
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
woods um internet is not that available
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
and patients of ours who are on Medicaid
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
often can't afford internet access um
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
and so my business in Laconia is
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
probably only about 40% tah health I
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
would like to see it go up um because I
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
think that more people could take
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
advantage of it especially with limited
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation um it's easier for the
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
patients as well as the providers um but
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
I I'm hoping that that number increases
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
and that tella Health stays with us for
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
a long time because it has made a world
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
of difference to people especially
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
during Co thank you
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%

being here last year with commissioner

a Deputy Commissioner uh for about two
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%

that I was an associate commissioner
 
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%

services field for 30 plus years so I
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
feel I have a good sense of the of the
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
department although there's always more
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
to learn for sure so uh thank you for
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
having us here today and I'll let
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
Marissa introduce herself great so again
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
Marissa hen um I grew up here in conquer
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
um spent my career after college and
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
graduate school out of state in New York
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
and Utah primarily but upon starting my
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
own family wanted my daughter to have
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
the same um incredible childhood and
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
healthy childhood that I was fortunate
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
to have here so returned to the Granite
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
State about a year and a half ago um and
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
was privileged to accept the position of
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner um under uh under
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
Lori Weaver's leadership here um at the
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
department uh the areas we as associate
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we really work um cross-
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
departmentally looking for as many
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities for integration and um
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
strategic alignment as possible um but
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
that said we do have some particular
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
areas of focus and in my case um that is
 
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh DCF division for children youth and
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
families which of course is both child
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
welfare and Juvenile Justice as well as
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
the division for Behavioral Health um
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
which encompasses uh both the community-
 
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
based uh mental health system that we
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
just just heard about um as well as our
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
rapid response our um acute system the
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll just say as you're
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
probably aware um just over six months
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
ago uh the state acquired Hamstead
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
Hospital which has long been the sole
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital for children in our
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
state so that is now a state run
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
facility and I'm um very pleased with
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to support that facility
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.790 align:start position:0%
children safe from very dangerous

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
infectious
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
diseases safe and effective
 
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
immunizations have prevented millions of
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
illnesses disabilities and deaths
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
immunization has led to the eradication
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
of diseases such as small ox and
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
historic low numbers of diseases like me
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
measles or Hepatitis B it's the way our
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
communities and individuals take care of
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
themselves and their neighbors and their
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
classmates we have seen in other areas
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
across the country where viruses such as
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
polio have crept back into the community
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
after Decades of protection while the
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
department does not intend at this time
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
to add any new immunization a
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
requirements um maintain but we are
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
interested in maintaining the ability to
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
adopt rules to adjust the required
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines for schools and child care
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
these are necessary to protect the
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
health and safety of all New Hampshire
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
kids including those who cannot be
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
immunized due to their own health
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
conditions and it prevents the kind of
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
devastating outbreaks of things like
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
polio and measles that our grandparents
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
and our great grandparents lived through
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
and sadly took the lives of their
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
classmates friends and siblings we all
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate New Hampshire's unique
 
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
culture of Live Free or Die and our deep
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
respect for privacy and autonomy um so
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
we look forward to a rich discussion on
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
how we honor those tenants ensure
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
transparency in process and do not put
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
our children unnecessarily In Harm's Way
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to kids not only do we
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
care about vaccines we also deeply care
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
that families have the support they need
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
to thrive especially access to early
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
childhood and prevention initiatives
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
such as family support and home visiting
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
public health is continuing to work hand
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
inand with colleagues across the
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
department and in our communities to
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that Wick families have access
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
to farmers markets for fresh fruits and
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
veggies or Family Resource Centers that
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
are strong enough to keep their doors
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
open and every family that would like
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
home visiting services in those
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
critically important years can get it
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
and when we do it right using
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based programs and data
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
informed strategies we find that moms
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
and babies are healthier children are
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
better ready for school families are
 
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.750 align:start position:0%
better ready for school families are
more

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient and with access to
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
referrals and concrete supports kids are
 
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
referrals and concrete supports kids are
safer

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
safer
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
we need to invest in that kind of
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
prevention from both an economic point
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
of view and a public health point of
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
view if we can prevent adverse childhood
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
experiences from ever happening in the
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
first place we will turn the tide on the
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
increases we've seen that are costly in
 
00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
chronic diseases and behavioral health
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
problems and finally public health and
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid have been strongly aligned in
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
supporting access to labor and delivery
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
services in every corner of the state in
 
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
face of significant challenges
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
decreasing populations recruitment
 
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
challenges for qualified staff and the
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
rise in costs many of our smaller
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals have closed
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
their labor and delivery units leaving
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
young families with increasing travel
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
times to get to the most basic of care
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
there is an entire swath cutting across
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
the middle of the state not just the
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
North country straight through the
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
middle of the state that does not have
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
access to basic maternity care not only
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
has that created a Public Health crisis
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
of babies being born in unplanned places
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room at home even on
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
roots to the hospital putting both the
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
mother and the baby at significant risk
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
it also creates challenges for these
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
communities as families and businesses
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
make decisions on where to live and
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
where to set up shop it's hard to
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
attract young workers when there is no
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
place to get basic Medical Care together
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid we are looking at options
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
for appropriate rate setting postnatal
 
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559 align:start position:0%
care and relationships between bigger
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals and smaller hospitals
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities for integrated
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
cross-disciplinary Obstetrics and
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
pediatric teams this is really a problem
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
that is solvable together
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
so in wrapping up we would just like to
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that we are focused
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
on improving the health of the people in
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
your community by ensuring Access to
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
Health Care promoting the conditions
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
that make it easier to live healthy
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
lives by detecting preventing and
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
responding to infectious and chronic
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
diseases and making sure we have
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
credible transparent and actionable data
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is how we serve your community you
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%

presented um we do have several other
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
areas that aren't
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
really as as
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
um pertinent to legislation but they
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
support all the programs and services in
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
the department Department including pro
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
project management office where we're
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
implementing a a standard best practices
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
project management strategy for all of
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
our projects in the department
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
information security and awareness um
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was led by Elizabeth
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
gillet um our Deputy Information
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
Services off security officer uh data
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
warehousing and analytics is managed by
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
our our Mark Holk and he's really
 
00:46:55.549 --> 00:46:55.559 align:start position:0%
managing all the data governance that
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
we're putting in place across Ross all
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
of our different systems to manage the
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
privacy and security of the information
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we manage and then our last area is
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
application hardware and life cycle
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
management which is led by Jim fenmore
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
for really managing all of our systems
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
as they go through a normal process of
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
implementation utilization in operations
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%

synergy
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of vulnerable
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
populations in the
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
state some of our major ongoing
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
initiatives at this time include
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
preparing for the unwinding of Medicaid
 
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.510 align:start position:0%
preparing for the unwinding of Medicaid
continuous

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
continuous
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment we also are working on a
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
number of initiatives to try to mitigate
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
the cliff effect which is essentially
 
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:20.950 align:start position:0%
the cliff effect which is essentially
when

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who are uh receiving Public
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
Assistance seek employment or perhaps a
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
promotion and the increase in their
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
earnings then be they become ineligible
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
for certain Public Assistance but often
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
times the increase in their earnings
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
does not match what they were making or
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
receiving rather for public assistance
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
this is known as the cliff effect and
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
this is the reason why a number of
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
individuals who receive public
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
assistants are not able to obtain
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
employment or take a promotion so we're
 
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
working on a number of initiatives to
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
try to mitigate that because we want
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
people to seek employment and pursue
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
careers or things that they really want
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
do we're also working on a number of
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
initi initiatives with respect to food
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
and security so trying to address access
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
to services with Outreach programs
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
making access easier for people um but
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
also working on uh ways that they can uh
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
receive uh programs like SNAP benefits
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
and um address some of the food in
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
security issues that they
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
have we also are working on
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
strengthening the child care industry in
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so Child Care is an area
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
that I oversee and really looking to
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
work with a number of pilots and
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
initiatives we have in the Bureau of
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
Child Development to strengthen our
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
relationship with the business community
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh obtain professional development for
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
child care
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
providers try to seek ways of of
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
creating opportunities for startups or
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
strengthening existing facilities
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
particularly in what's known as child
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
care deserts so areas where families do
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
not have access to child care um or they
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%

00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
question um Can can I ask a question
 
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:44.839 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead oh yes I I wonder you
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned Cliff effect uh and that you
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
have some strategies could you briefly
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
tell what actually you can do to help
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's accurate but uh what
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
exactly uh does can can you do to help
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
people uh to overcome Cliff effect yeah
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
sure so some of the strategies that
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
we're doing were testing just to see if
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
they are truly effective and that some
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
of those will take one two maybe even
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
three years to complete uh and and
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
analyze so for example with respect to
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
the tanif program which is Cashes syst
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
Children what we are piloting is a
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
disregard of um new income for a period
 
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
of time so that they would continue to
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
be eligible for tanif and be able to
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
receive that new income at the same time
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
to strengthen their financial ability
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
and financial status so that they can
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
continue on with without the public
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
assistance in the future so that's just
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
an example um this past uh last
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
legislative session we had also
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
increased the um uh poverty level for
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility for snap it was at 185 up to
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
185% of federal poverty level which now
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
it's at
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
200 that will actually make a number of
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
a few thousand children eligible for the
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
snap program which also is intended to
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
strengthen those
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
families thank
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Edwards uh thank
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%

01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
understand our rental assistance status
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
as a state for a while now and I I see
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
it in different pieces and I was
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if before you came to division
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
3 uh the department if you could answer
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know be prepared answer four
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
questions and we can take them offline
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
um what are the number of rental units
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh what is the percentage of
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
those rental units that are receiving
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
some form of rental assistance from
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
either the federal or the
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
state uh what is the average rental cost
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and what is the average
 
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
amount of the rental assistance per
 
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.029 align:start position:0%
amount of the rental assistance per
beneficiary

01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
beneficiary
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think you're prepared to
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
answer those today but I but I'd love to
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
know what those are uh I'd also like to
 
01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:35.799 align:start position:0%
just thank you for taking a look at this
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
Cliff effect I it you know I think
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
anyone who's looked at welfare payments
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
knows it's a it's a real issue and uh
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's getting in the way of people going
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
on with their lives so thank you thank
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
you for your questions and I will get
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
you some information to answer
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
those I could make a comment about the
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
cliff fact also um investigating welfare
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
fraud for 23 years in many cases
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
because they they were struggling
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
financially even after they went to work
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
they didn't report it and that was a
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
violation of Law and resulted in over
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
insurance benefits and prosecution in
 
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
many cases so uh so it's it can be a
 
01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:16.910 align:start position:0%
many cases so uh so it's it can be a
problem

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you I have some
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
pragmatic questions actually I there
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
were two two statements between yourself
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
and a previous
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
presenter that really resonate with me
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
I've been working with people with
 
01:02:33.269 --> 01:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
complex disabilities for the last 35
 
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
years of my life the cliff effect is Big
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
fragmentation in health care is big and
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
the prag the pragmatic question I have
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
is what role do we as legislators have
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
to collaborate with you to help work on
 
01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:52.349 align:start position:0%
to collaborate with you to help work on
those

01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
problems there is a great deal of
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity moving forward to work
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
together in
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
addressing the Mitigation Of The Cliff
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
effect if not the elimination of it um
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
so certainly being able to work with us
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
with some proposed strategies uh that we
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
would need your support on uh and any

cliff effect greatly appreciate your

01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
actually is creation of legislation
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
going forward and and you know
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
Grassroots talking about that kind of
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
collaboration what opportunities are for
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%

department and we do have other
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%

robust opportunity of working with your
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
committee members uh but just being
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
mindful even though we're slightly ahead
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
of schedule still uh we have quite a few
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
other program areas that would like to
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
introduce themselves to you sir sure
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative Merchant you
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
had a question uh if you may thank you
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair in regards to the cliff effect
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
how much of this is controlled by the
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
state how much is controlled by the
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
federal government because obviously the
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
state we can do something about the
 
01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:22.039 align:start position:0%
federal we can't so before we spend a
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
lot of time in this Arena how much of it
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
actually is controlled by us here in New
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus what's coming out of
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
DC so it depends on the program so we're
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
looking at different initiatives in
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
tanif for family assistance which there
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
are indeed some uh components to that
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
that are controlled by the state through
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
state law or administrative rules so we
 
01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
do have some wiggle room or flexibility
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
if you will Child Care is another area
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh that we do have some flexibility in
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
to address uh with respect to
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility and then also uh through the
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
snap program supplemental nutrition for
 
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh assistance program we do have some
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility there as well as we just had
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh made some changes to eligibility this
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
last year so we we do have some
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility there not completely but
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%

confusion confusing in terms of who's in
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
front of you for what what reason
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%

like long-term services and support um
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the uh mental health division of
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
um the Rob um Joe ripon's division
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
DCF um El ltss we're we're basically the
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
supporting financing arm to to those
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
services that can um with rided funding
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
meaning Medicaid funding and general
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
funds and sometimes other grant money
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
that we support them in that role and
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
are sort of the the key contact with uh
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
CMS centers for Medicaid Medicare
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
Services sometimes you'll see it
 
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
abbreviated as cmcs which is uh the
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
basically the part that deals with both
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
the children and the adults under
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and they want a prime contact
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
um a single point of contact for the
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
state with respect to Medicaid I I serve
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
in that role I certainly work in
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
partnership with all the other division
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
directors um and
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
U you know I think in terms of uh the
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
program today um we're almost at 250,000
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
individuals covered by Medicaid
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
um prior to the federal Public Health
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%

01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
federally we were closer to
 
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
180,000 um I'm going to speak to that a
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more on one of the slides

little bit on Slide

01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
heard about is that $ 1.7 trillion doll
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
bill that passed through Congress just
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
before the end of the year it contains
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
some Medicaid provisions and one of them
 
01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.870 align:start position:0%
some Medicaid provisions and one of them
was

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
um addressing a priority of of New
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as other um
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
states that uh there'd be a decoupling
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
of the continuous coverage from the
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
federal public health emergency and you
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
know we've been at this for will be
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
close to three years where there's been
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage what that meant is
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
that an individual didn't necessarily
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
need to complete an eligibility renewal
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain coverage and that
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
was I think a federal policy to protect
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
against what were the health concerns
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
related to the the federal Public Health
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
Emergency um if I can just jump ahead
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
and come back a little bit but if you go
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
to slide um last two
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
slides I didn't put a page number on
 
01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.910 align:start position:0%
slides I didn't put a page number on
those

01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.830 align:start position:0%
those
apologize

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
um the the second to last page gives you
 
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
the status as of the end of December
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
which we had just just under 200 49,000
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
people at that point um there areund if
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
you look at the leftand
 
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
Circle um there's 10
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
12,482 people who have been what we call
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
in a protected status meaning because of
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
the continuous coverage requirements
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
under federal law that uh they needed we
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
could not uh disenroll them or otherwise
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
we'd forfeit the enhanced Federal
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
funding we've been getting during this
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
three-year period
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
no no state in the country had uh has
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
gone forgone that and as a result of the
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislation um starting April 1st um
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
individuals um who are in that protected
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
status um will start to do what we call
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
the unwind which means that individuals
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
in that group who
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
don't uh complete their eligibility or
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
may have um aged out of Medicaid or may
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
now be over income that they run the
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
risk of of losing
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
coverage um on the right hand circle on
 
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
that second to last page we know um the
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
the lighter shade is about almost 30,000
 
01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.229 align:start position:0%
the lighter shade is about almost 30,000
people

01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
29,95 in this page that are pending and
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
eligible which means we have information
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
today that suggests that they no longer
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
are eligible as I mentioned over income
 
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
um maybe now over Medicare eligible Etc
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we have to go through certain
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
procedures before we can do that in fact
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
um next week we'll be meeting with CMS
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
to review our unwind plan to make sure
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
they're um consistent with Federal
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
guidance one part of the guidance is
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
that you can't disenroll everybody at
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
the same time you have to um do it uh at
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
about a one nth of your enrollment at a
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
time and the reason reason for that is
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
that the eligibility team which Karen
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
who was just up here um runs that group
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
that they want there to be normal
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
operations in other words um
 
01:14:38.189 --> 01:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
redeterminations is is a heavy workload
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
to to complete that they want to make
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
sure that states get back to a sort of a
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
a more even distribution and don't have
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
a bolus of redeterminations where they
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't do a good job
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
on um the number of people that will
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
will lose eligibility well we'll deal
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
deal with um having to deal with 1 nth
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
we would expect in the earlier periods
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
of that unwind that more people we're
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
going to we've tried to prioritize those
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
individuals that we know that aren't
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
eligible to do those un wines first
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
versus people that for example maybe in
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
a nursing home or what what have you uh
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
that you know they may be not completing
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
their eligibility because of
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances we we've been doing a lot
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
of Outreach in fact I think New
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is looked to in the in the
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
country is doing one of the best jobs
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
and trying to make sure that those who
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
deserve to remain who are eligible
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
remain covered and those that aren't to
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
to work that through the last page sort
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
of gives you a a snapshot at the end of
 
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
December of that 10,000 where they fall
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
um one of the concerning areas for me um
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I and I expect for you are the ones
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
sort of on the right hand side of that
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
chart that there are nearly 35,000
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
children that are at risk of of losing
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility if um family members who are
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
their responsible party do not do their
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
eligibility paperwork um we're doing
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
Special Outreach
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
we've called every household that we
 
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
could call some in some cases where
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
there's um some of what I'll call the
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
the more um challenging eligibility
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
people who might have mental illness or
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
U might have a disability what have you
 
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.430 align:start position:0%
U might have a disability what have you
um

01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
are part of one of our waiver programs
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
are in long-term care that we're doing
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
extra extra work and we've um worked
 
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
closely with the provider community and
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
our mcos to to uh reach everybody we can
 
01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.350 align:start position:0%
our mcos to to uh reach everybody we can
multiple

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
times I could just jump back now to uh
 
01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.189 align:start position:0%
times I could just jump back now to uh
Slide

01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
Slide
 
01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
Five um item two on that
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
list was what was passed last
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
legislative session we're in a good
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
place with respect to um implementing
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
what was passed legislatively we um have
 
01:17:03.149 --> 01:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
an April 1st date for implementing that
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
we've made progress of submitting all
 
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
the state plan amendments and waivers to
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
um accomplish what was in the
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
legislation we've um entered into a
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
contract with Delta Dental to provide
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
the the network and the and the
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
insurance component of it and so I just
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you what was past
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
last session part by this committee and
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
and finance and so forth that we're well
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
on our way there this committee also
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
last session um uh put forward the um
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
increasing the income limits related to
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
the in andout program this is people
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
these are people in the mental health
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
center space who have to incur medical
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
bills of a certain level in order to to
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
gain Medicaid coverage so they in andout
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
describes what's happening to to them
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
they get eligibility temporarily
 
01:17:59.470 --> 01:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
depending on their expenses and we had
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
not raised the um the income thresholds
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
for a long time and so the legislation
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
um that was enacted is increasing those
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that went into effect January 1 as
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
required under the
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um the next one on the list
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
is the U what is sometimes known as
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion the New Hampshire
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage healthc Care Program
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh authorization that uh there's been a
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
commission that made recommendation on
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
that I suspect you'll see legislation on
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
that uh Topic in the near future um and
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
that uh if there's not a reauthorization
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
that occurs by December 31st that
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
end last session um number five was the
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
postpartum uh
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
coverage um since the the the
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislature had agreed to that but there
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
was some difference in on another
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
portion of a bill in the committee of
 
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
conference that Committee of conference
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
piece did not uh fail because there
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't a signature on that um but what's
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
changed as a result of the Consolidated
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation Act is that when we cons
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
when it was considered last year by the
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
committee um there was a 5-year limit on
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
how long that enhanced Federal match
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be available the the Consolidated
 
01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation act um did away with that
 
01:19:29.719 --> 01:19:30.910 align:start position:0%
appropriation act um did away with that
5-year

01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
5-year
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
limitation and so now if the state
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
adopts it it's permanent um be happy to
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
share with the committee the there's a
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
nice uh chart that I had shared map of
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the United States where this has been
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
adopted basically what they're providing
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
here is rather than just someone who's a
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
woman that's pregnant who delivers a
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
baby having 60 days of coverage Post
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
delivery it would allow for a year and I
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
won't get into the reason so much for
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
that but it's it's good for um mother's
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh health conditions and caring for
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
their child have the extended coverage
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
if you get on the eastn seab board New
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state that has not
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
adopted that yet although we we came
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
very close last session um another
 
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
provision that was in the um end of year
 
01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
provision that was in the um end of year
package

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
package
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
was effective um January 1st of 24
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
children who are um under 19 years of
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
age will have continuous coverage for
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
year so that was a a component um that
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh all states will have to to provide
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
for um I'm sure this session you'll see
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
um issues come up on Medicaid rates um
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
Home Care is an area where obviously
 
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
there are Workforce shortages um
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh we we were able to last
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
session um pass an increase to bring our
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates up to 50% of Medicare um
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
if you've followed the news recently um
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
Maine um had a blue ribbon commission
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
they they're struggling ambulance
 
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
coverage uh is experiencing some of the
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
same Workforce
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
shortages and uh I would imagine that we
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
might see something there um maternity
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
was discussed uh previously by by um our
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
director of Public Health it's an area
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
that we collaborate closely on um
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um particularly
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
the um Residential Services we've made
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
some improvements in that space But I I
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
suspect that you may hear about those
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
issues as well as uh our community
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
centers um I don't have anything
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
specific there but I'm just trying to um
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
raise awareness that we may
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
have conversations about that the
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
department and its agency budget
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
included uh $20 million in terms of the
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services the
 
01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
insurance programs $20 million over
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
the um the the B the next bium to to
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
deal with rate changes and we didn't do
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
anything more specific than
 
01:22:21.629 --> 01:22:21.639 align:start position:0%
that uh lastly um you may be interested
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
and again this is not an exhaustive list
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
I just thought this would be good at as
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
an introductory meeting um you know
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
waivers and state plan amendments that
 
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
our division through um the policy unit
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
does a lot of the work to stand up the
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
state plan amendments that are are
 
01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.189 align:start position:0%
state plan amendments that are are
brought

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
brought
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
forward um one of a special interest I
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
think is the waiver that we received uh
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
in 2018 that allowed us to get a better
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
Federal match and provide for imp
 
01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
patient substance use disorder services
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
and subsequently last June the extension
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
for uh psychiatric inpatient Services um
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
that waiver um is a combined waiver
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
began in
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
2018 we have a a renewal request in um
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
currently and also have included a a
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
portion in this new waiver request to
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
provide some support on a pilot basis to
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh the State Correctional facility for
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
people transitioning out of jail for
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
example who are in a treatment for sud
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
or or mental health to make sure that
 
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
they get um plugged
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
into um providers in the community
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
before they leave uh the state
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
correction system so that there's not a
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
gap that leads them you know ending back
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
up with a
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
problem and lastly uh work with uh um
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
achieving a support of housing uh waiver
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
which we received in September we're
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
working with some other states in terms
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
of how to work on implementing that but
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
basically it's not for rent it's for PE
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with mental health or
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder conditions who
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
need extra wraparound supports to be
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
maintain themselves in um housing in the
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
community and let me stop there and take
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative thanks um I have a
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
question about Outreach um the
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
application for Medicaid is stressful
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
challenging at times especially for the
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
group of people that we're talking about
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious two things number one
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
what type of Outreach Services you have
 
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
and and more importantly at least I
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
think from this perspective is what
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of your budget is attributed
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
that if you can answer that so in terms
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
of the last part in terms of uh Outreach
 
01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:01.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't have that separately
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
identified what I can tell you for
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
example with Community Mental Health
 
01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.669 align:start position:0%
example with Community Mental Health
Centers

01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
Centers
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
um we've provided the if a person is
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
attached to a Community Mental Health
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
Center we've provided them information
 
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
back on their their clients or their
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
patients in terms of what was
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
outstanding for them to comp complete
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
their eligibility
 
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
renewal through that effort just since
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
June for example we've been able to
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
Across the program get 25,000
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
individuals to do their redeterminations
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
on a voluntary basis before they had to
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
we've also been able to identify about
 
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
we've also been able to identify about
1,200

01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
1,200
 
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who um voluntarily when
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
contacted them asked them do you still
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
need your your Medicaid have said I
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't I've got something else uh that
 
01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
we've done so we've been um doing
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
Outreach through sort of existing
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
providers through through our own phone
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
calls we we beefed up the eligibility uh
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
section by bringing in through the
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
executive Council and using uh believe
 
01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.109 align:start position:0%
executive Council and using uh believe
ARA

01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
ARA
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
funds um beefed up our call center to
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
free up staff to be able to do that
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
Outreach that was about a $3 million
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
investment um
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
that we made and there's an additional
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
request in for additional arer
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
dollars so that's about more than 25% of
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
the people on State on Medicaid correct
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
um currently it's about one and five and
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
a half individuals are on Medicaid um
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
typically we're one in seven you know
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
compared to for example Vermont or Maine
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're typically one in four so New
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generally has a a lower
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
um you all set I think so yeah okay okay
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
presentative oh I'm sorry go ahead thank
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you director
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
Litman for taking my question um I
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
erroneously thought that in recent years
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
all of Medicaid was protected so could
 
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
you just briefly in case I missed it
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
what differentiates protected versus
 
01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.950 align:start position:0%
what differentiates protected versus
unprotected

01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
unprotected
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
currently um so there are individuals
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
all along the way during the three-year
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
period have you know taken an interest
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
to do their redetermination um
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
irrespective so they've they've re they
 
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
they proved that they have eligibility
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
so there's no no risk to them if you
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
will we've encouraged all along for
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
people to continue to to do eligibility
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
redetermination so that they didn't have
 
01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:45.629 align:start position:0%
redetermination so that they didn't have
a

01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
risk thank you yes go
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
is the bulk of Medicaid Health Care
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
Services that's the first question if I
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
may follow up with the yes Miss liit so
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of our capitation arrangement
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
with the mcos the current contract to
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
cover this current year is a $1.3
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
billion contract which you know um in
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the the health care component
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 90% of the the capitation
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
payment we pay is for the Healthcare
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
Services paying providers there's uh
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
88.3% uh administrative uh overhead that
 
01:28:36.109 --> 01:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
we pay to the mcos for um the the
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage population and 7.6 for
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
standard um there's a 2% premium tax and
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
a 1.5% budget profit the reason I asked
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
the question is the fact
 
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
that when we look at critical access
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals in state of New Hampshire as
 
01:28:53.639 --> 01:28:54.709 align:start position:0%
hospitals in state of New Hampshire as
providers

01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
um it's not only the fact that the
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
patient loses the coverage it also means
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
the impact of the critical access
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals financially can you speak that
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
for me please yes
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
um the fact that someone has coverage
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
means that if they provide the service
 
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go to a bad debt
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
so if you look at potentially um you
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
know our our initial estimates are that
 
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
of the 100,000 102,000 that potentially
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
60% of those
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
individuals won't retain eligibility so
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a population of
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
60,000 or so people that have some risk
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
of of
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
Eligibility um that when they use
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals or doctor's offices or what
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
have you that those providers um um
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
won't have to absorb that in a different
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
way assuming they have a mission of
 
01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
serving all I think particularly you
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
know the vulnerable popul ations
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh who we know use Healthcare um and
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
we've done analytics on that as well in
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
terms of making sure that the the people
 
01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
that are consuming a lot of healthcare
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
that we give ourselves the most time to
 
01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they've had a fair
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
chance to prove their eligibility for
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
for their reasons and for the provider
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
community that we rely
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
on okay other
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
questions I actually had it I'm sorry
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
somebody have their hand up
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'm really sorry more not sorry but
 
01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
I am thank you Mr chairman I really
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for not saying that earlier I
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
have one more question that's really
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
important Ashley what do you have any
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
numbers on what percentage of providers
 
01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
in this state do not accept
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um I I can do some I'm off the
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
top of my head no um but we do can tell
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
you that enrollment within the providers
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid we have 30
 
01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
th000 providers enrolled in Medicaid for
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
the state somewhere about that number um
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
those that aren't enrolled I think it
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
depends on the the specialty and but we
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
have all the hospitals all the major
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
medical groups um so you do have all the
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals now you do have all the
 
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.510 align:start position:0%
hospitals now you do have all the
hospitals

01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay I actually had a couple of
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
questions myself um are you are you also
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
a representative okay um having been in
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
the department and dealt with
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility working closely with DFA
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
over the course of my career um the
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
redetermination um issue uh I know that
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was six months sometimes it
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
was a year does it does does that vary
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
or is it now pretty much a year on
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or year on Medicaid yes and
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be there's a provision
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
related to snap that we can bring
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
alignment between those um at times so
 
01:31:50.189 --> 01:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of maybe one variation
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
from theme but once that's established
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
it's a year okay
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
and what's the average uh length of time
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
that a a redetermination is passed due
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
is there an average you could give me on
 
01:32:03.149 --> 01:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
that or want to make sure I'm
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
understanding your question in terms of
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
how much overdue are people that are on
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
this on average yeah how how overdue are
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
they um there could be people that are
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
overdue as much as three it'd be
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
approximately three years or less okay
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
um because of the The Continuous
 
01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
eligibility and that's that's why we've
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
been since July of 2020 we've been
 
01:32:25.149 --> 01:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
meeting nearly every week to figure out
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
we don't we want to make sure we don't
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
have like this um tsunami of Eligibility
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
to do that we can manage it so that we
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
don't fall behind and someone doesn't
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
lose coverage just because we can't keep
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
up with the pace is that in part due to
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
the pandemic or AB 100% related to that
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
the provision okay thank
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
else okay thank you very much you're
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Ellen the point I am

I will uh Circle back to New Hampshire

some other teammates who are here and
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%

introduce themselves as well um but I
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
will speak briefly about Glen Cliff Hol
 
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh path in the forensic facility first
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh Glen Cliff home as you may know is a
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility located in Glen
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
Cliff New Hampshire they have current
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
capacity as well as very close to
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
occupancy of
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
75 patients there um they primarily
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
serve older adults at that location who
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
require longterm level of care um and
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
also suffer from a severe mental
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
illness uh the path program as many of
 
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
you may know is a 16 bed transitional
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
housing program that has capacity for 16
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
individuals the individuals that are
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
supported at the path program come from
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital and uh the path
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
program helps support them in finding
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
community- based housing and resources
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
so that they can discharge back into the
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
community the forensic facility as I
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned is slated to be built uh Start
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
begin Construction in the springtime of
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
this year with planned occupancy of 24
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
beds um we are currently working on our
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
operations plan for the forensic
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
facility and there may be some
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
legislative efforts that come forth in
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
the coming session that you may see in
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
terms of our ability to operationalize
 
01:35:06.719 --> 01:35:07.830 align:start position:0%
terms of our ability to operationalize
that

01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
program in terms of New Hampshire
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
hospital and again I'll be brief um
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire hospital and in
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
the program areas that I already
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
discussed have far fewer bureaus and
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
divisions um although with uh New
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Glen Cliff home and
 
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
path we have approximately 800 employees
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
so we are a very large portion of uh
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS overall makeup when you add the uh
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
forensic Hospital staff at some point in
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
the future when that becomes operational
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
it'll add about an an additional 100
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
employees for a total of about 900
 
01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
individuals working between uh the New
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Glen Cliffe path
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care New Hampshire hospital
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
has current capacity for 154 adults we
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
recently through several uh efforts at
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital increased our
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
capacity from 145 to
 
01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
154 we understand that there uh is
 
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
significant need for these acute beds uh
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
across the state and really this level
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
of service and Care um we do try to work
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
closely with the Community Mental Health
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
Centers as well as the other designated
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities to try to have
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
individuals service either in the
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
community with those resources
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
or in an alternate uh receiving facility
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
to receive that level of care because
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital um H you know is
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
in such great
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
demand um we have um some of our
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
challenges that we're facing currently
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
that you may hear about is some
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
significant Workforce related concerns
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
in some of our departments we have some
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
significant uh vacancy rates that we're
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
working closely with the department and
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
others to try to address and have been
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
working with them for the past um year
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
or so Co was a challenge for us and
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
continues to be um from a a hospital and
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
inpatient perspective but we have again
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
a great team um who has come together to
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
keep our patient population and our
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
staff safe um I I also mentioned um I
 
01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned the word safety a couple times
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
I would say from a New Hampshire
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
hospital perspective our main goals as
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
it stands are uh patient and staff
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
safety as well as appropriate treatment
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
and care for those patients in need
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
those are um key and at the Forefront of
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
our decision making Staffing definitely
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
plays um into that so sometimes we have
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
to make some difficult decisions about
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
capacity to in order to maintain our
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
staffing levels um and provide the care
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to the patients we serve some
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
of the things that New Hampshire
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
hospital also wants to continue to focus
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
on in the coming uh year is increasing
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
services with PE for people with severe
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
mental illness um in the community to
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
better allow for stabilized patients who
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
are currently residing at New Hampshire
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
hospital to be discharged this will
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
obviously directly relate to our ability
 
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
to um admit other patients in need and
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
address uh some of the Ed boarding that
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
you may be hearing about currently um
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
another thing that we work with with
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
DHHS and um other other departments is
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
addressing affordable housing needs for
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
people with de disab AB ilities that's a
 
01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:27.159 align:start position:0%
significant um concern for us and and a
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
discharge barrier currently again Co
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
exacerbated that concern so we're really
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
wanting to um partner with other folks
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out some housing
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
resources across the state so that we
 
01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
can ease up the current patient
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
population at New Hampshire hospital and
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
again admit folks who are in acute
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
distress uh what I'd like to do is
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%

01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I'm sorry did you
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
have a question for do uh yes yes sir I
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
did this is for the CMO um I I've been
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh I've been curious and just have never
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
thought to ask what is our success rate
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
with our uh inpatient returning to the
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
community uh in a way in which they're
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
productive they're safe uh they're
 
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
they're competent are do we do we
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
experience much success rate or or or is
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
this a
 
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
habitually long-term chronic you know
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
there is no there is no um full health
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's just a ongoing requirement in
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
different settings what could you
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
describe that a little bit sure so I
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
would say that you know we do have a
 
01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
population of patients who um are
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
one-time customers we definitely see
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
that and we stabilize them and they move
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
on to be stabilized in the community at
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
different levels of care and we
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
certainly have patients who are uh
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
frequent customers um but you know our
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
definition of success for those folks
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
also has to do with the amount of time
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
they spend outside our facility remember
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
that at one point in history um this
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
whole population of patients resided at
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
new Hospital full-time and so uh even
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
for those uh frequent customers the fact
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
that we're able to stabilize them and
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
that they spend most of their time
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
living in the community um is part of
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
our success
 
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
rate sure go ahead thank you thank you
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
do do you um do you maintain records in
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
a way in which you can sort of track
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
them longitudinally to know what the
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts of our our treatment
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
plans are and our and the lost the
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
community of care services or system of
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
care that we we try to wrap around
 
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
them I'm not I'm not sure that we report
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
on that quite the way that you're
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
describing but um I can go back to my
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
team and see what we can find that that
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
could try to answer that question a
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
quantitatively great thank you any any
 
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
other questions for this for the
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
doctor H yes representative
 
01:43:24.189 --> 01:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
I have many questions which I'll
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
save for later but two specific
 
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
questions it seems to me that being the
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
head of New Hampshire hospital is a
 
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
pretty significant responsib is this for
 
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
the doctor or for the this is for the
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
administrator of the are we all set with
 
01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:46.390 align:start position:0%
administrator of the are we all set with
the

01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
doctor think we are okay thank you sir
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you the question is why why are
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
they adding on
 
01:43:53.599 --> 01:43:54.950 align:start position:0%
they adding on
more

01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh for you um uh when
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
there are major problems of that New
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital so that's one
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
question and I know that that you do
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
what you're told and that you don't make
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
those decisions so it's really more for
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for somebody else the
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
second question is how are we doing
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%
follow up okay follow up that uh with
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the patients who are being held in New
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospitals illegally uh are we
 
01:44:34.589 --> 01:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
making any uh inroads and and getting
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
those patients out of those General
 
01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals and into New Hampshire
 
01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
hospital are you speaking about patients
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
who are currently awaiting care and
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
residing in emergency departments
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state yes so um as it
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
stands this morning the cue of
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
individuals adult adult who are awaiting
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
care is
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
41 um we have the anticipation of
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
approximately four admissions to New
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital this morning um based
 
01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
on discharges that are occurring so we
 
01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
quickly turn over our open beds to
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are as timely as possible
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
with meeting those needs we also you'll
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
hear briefly from Hamstead hospital
 
01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
after me we collaborate closely with
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
them um as in certain circumstances they
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
have the availability to serve young
 
01:45:22.639 --> 01:45:23.830 align:start position:0%
have the availability to serve young
adults

01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
adults
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire hospital only serves
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
individuals who are 18 and above um we
 
01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
also are very well supported by the
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the rest of the
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
department to try to address these needs
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
and work through individual resources
 
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
and opportunities that exists to enhance
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
those resources so that we can turn over
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
our current beds um and accept new
 
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
individuals into those beds who need our
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
level of care as I previously mentioned
 
01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
too with the other designated receiving
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
facilities they do have um often have
 
01:45:57.790 --> 01:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
capacity to be able to accept
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
individuals and we try to communicate
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
with them um as often as possible to see
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
if they are able to offer any additional
 
01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
relief to that that weight list as
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate follow up yes go ahead so
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're still breaking the law uh that's a
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
fact I can't really answer that question
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
I can
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead one other member
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to briefly introduce who's
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
very new to his role having started just
 
01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
last week but um the his role
 
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
notoriously has um been a a key
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
representation at these committees in
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
the past and he's as he picks up speed
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you'll be seeing more of
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
him that's Brett Mason who is our New
 
01:46:48.189 --> 01:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Chief Financial
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
Officer any other
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions yes go ahead representative
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
chair um you said something amazing at
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your presentation you
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
said that you're fully staffed at Glen
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
Cliff is that correct uh no that's not
 
01:47:06.669 --> 01:47:06.679 align:start position:0%
accurate so I wish that were the case um
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliff home has had some
 
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
difficulties with their Staffing as well
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
their current capacity is 75 and the uh
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
rationale for that is primarily based on
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
Staffing they do have a higher capacity
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
of um about 120
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
however you know we do strive to try to
 
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
work with local communities as well to
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
have those individuals needs met in
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
their local community community before
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
considering an admission to Glen Cliff
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
home thank you I was concern thinking
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
that you had some solution for the rest
 
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:42.679 align:start position:0%
of the state yes
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative um and how many children
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
are waiting to be admitted I don't have
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
that answer but I'm sure that Kathy
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
Collins um who is at I think right after
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
me be able to provide that inform thank
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%

01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you any other questions
 
01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:58.830 align:start position:0%

representative I thank you um I've heard
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
a lot about exacerbated staffing issues
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
and so especially during covid do you
 
01:48:13.229 --> 01:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
have stats as to why is it wage wage
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
related is it there are increased
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
staffing needs because of Co like what
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%

01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
pinpoint I don't have any specific
 
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
information in front of me however I do
 
01:48:27.629 --> 01:48:27.639 align:start position:0%
think that it's a culmination of many
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
different areas I think that there was a
 
01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
vast majority we started at New
 
01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital of uh senior staff
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
members who were close to retirement and
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
chose that point in time to be able to
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
pursue that retirement um there you know
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
social work for example thankfully
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's been an increase call for
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
supporting mental health in communities
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
and particularly at the school system so
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
we did lose a significant amount of um
 
01:48:57.629 --> 01:48:57.639 align:start position:0%
experienced social workers to education
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
systems which is great for the overall
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
system but of course um creates some
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
some limited uh resources at New
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital so those are just a
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
couple of examples I would say that pay
 
01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
um is is a factor that um is being paid
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
close attention to by both the
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner um as well as the
 
01:49:19.229 --> 01:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
governor's office and there have been
 
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
some efforts to try to equalize some of
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
those dis disparities um at this point
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
but um you know we do send tend to see
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
folks who are very interested in the
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
state's benefit package that helps us
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
often but I think one of the biggest
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
concerns is that um we're competing
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
against one another significantly from a
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
health care perspective there are as you
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
know I believe 35 or so hospitals
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire uh
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital is one of those
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
entities we're all searching for social
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
workers we're all searching for nurses
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're all searching for providers um and
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
the pool is very very small um so you
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
know it makes a very difficult
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance for any of us or all of us
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
to be successful when we have such
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
constrained resources in the state
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
chair um for the folks who haven't been
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
following uh what we've been doing
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
legislatively with the nhh for a while
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
is there we used to have a horrible
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
problem with warehousing patients in
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
need in local emergency rooms awaiting a
 
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
bed in the New Hampshire hospital and
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
we've tried some policies to to smooth
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
out that uh patient flow um where are we
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
at now what what do you know about uh
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
the status of whether or not we have uh
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
prospective nhh patients uh being
 
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
warehoused and
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
ERS um so again I think you're you're
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
talking about the um q that that exists
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
for patients who require Mental Health
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
Services throughout the state so as I
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh briefly already um we do
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
again New Hampshire hospital does
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
everything in our ability to try to have
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
needs met and get patients out of EDS
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire hospital to have
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
their needs uh you know their acute
 
01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
needs um addressed however we are
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
working with some significantly
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
constrained resources as I mentioned
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
Staffing being one of them that is a
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
factor in why New Hampshire hospital hit
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
capacity is currently at 154 um in the
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
past it's been as high as
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
185 um again most recently we were able
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
to reintroduce nine beds back into
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
service but that was not because uh we
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
had additional staff to do so it's
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
because we uh spread our resources a
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
little bit broader to be able to open
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
those additional beds so um it's always
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
a continuous day-to-day effort to try to
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
get patients off of that queue and into
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
our facility and again we also try to
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the designated
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities some of which have
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
also had limited capacity as I
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
understand due to Staffing um over the
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
last two years um through covid so you
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
know any type of effort um that is made
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
across the state is definitely something
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire hospital would
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
support in terms of additional resources
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
and um bed capacity followup
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you I just so
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm I'm almost always very
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
impressed by the people that work at the
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
department that wasn't the answer to my
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
question though I I know you guys are
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
working hard and doing smart things I'd
 
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
like to know if we're keeping track of
 
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
how many patients are being warehoused
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
and ERS because we don't have the
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
ability to make them inpatients at nhh
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason and whether or not
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
that status of warehousing is
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
continually monitored so that it could
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
be potentially reportable yes that's
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
accurate we do H we do have a daily
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
queue that we monitor seven days a week
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
right now that Quee is 40 and we also
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
have information back
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh 40 yes um and we do have information
 
01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.589 align:start position:0%
uh 40 yes um and we do have information
back

01:53:10.589 --> 01:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
to many previous years as to how that
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
number has ebed and flowed over
 
01:53:19.629 --> 01:53:19.639 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you did I see a hand up
 
01:53:19.639 --> 01:53:20.669 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you did I see a hand up
over

01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
here yes go ahead
 
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um you mentioned
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
recently that um within recent history
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
you had as many as 184 185 um but I'm
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
more interested in your um further
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
history like the 1960s and70s um is it
 
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is please correct me
 
01:53:42.069 --> 01:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong that you know several
 
01:53:44.069 --> 01:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
decades ago we had a much higher
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
capacity um can you explain if that is
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
the truth and if so why did the why and
 
01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
how did the capacity get so limited and
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
when thank thank you so I might actually
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
call Cindy babonis back up our director
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
of social work uh she's been in her role
 
01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:00.679 align:start position:0%
for the past couple of years but in
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
state service um as a social worker at
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital for many years to
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
your your question yes um and Cindy can
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
elaborate a bit more but going back uh
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
decades there was thousands of
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
individuals Dr fter mentioned this as
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
well who were residing um on the campus
 
01:54:24.430 --> 01:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
um and living there essentially and
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
really over time um we you know the
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
state made an effort to
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
deinstitutionalize individuals and have
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
them be able to return to their families
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
and their communities as appropriate
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
once they were stable and able to do so
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
can you speak more to that history sure
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a national history for
 
01:54:44.069 --> 01:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment in the 1960s is
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
when deinstitutionalization began but in
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
summary it was the advancement of
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
treatment medications available or um
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
even just support systems in the
 
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
community so we set up the community
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
mental health system which provides
 
01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
services intensive services to those
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
with mental health issues in their own
 
01:55:04.589 --> 01:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
homes in the community so that they
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to reside in an
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
institution um but kind of to the point
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the queue and what keeps us from
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
getting more people in I think there
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be a stronger focus on getting
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
people who don't need our level of care
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
out of our facility because we do have a
 
01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
good number of people that compete
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
competes with the number of people in
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
the queue that don't need our level of
 
01:55:26.589 --> 01:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
care anymore and they can't leave
 
01:55:28.109 --> 01:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the services in
 
01:55:30.669 --> 01:55:30.679 align:start position:0%
the community to keep them safe in the
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
community we've had more of them in the
 
01:55:35.069 --> 01:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
past and we've lost some of them in the
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
last 20
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
years okay representative you have a
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
question uh yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
please um correct me if I'm wrong my
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is that we in this state
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
have a functionally a hub and spoke
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
model where people come into an ER and
 
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
then they
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
assigned to one of several facilities
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
like I was under the understanding there
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
were eight different mental health
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
facilities are you one of those Aid or
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
issue so New Hampshire hospital I would
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
say um is
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
the area of service for the most acute
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
and most significant and severe mental
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
illnesses that um States individuals in
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire have we kind
 
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
of see ourselves as as the facility of
 
01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
Last Resort in that um you know we do
 
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
have a significant amount of um I'm
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
looking for the word uh limitations in
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
regards to where our patients can go um
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know different areas of access that
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
they can have um different levels of
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
supervision that they're allowed to have
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
all of which relates to where their
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
current state is in terms of their
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
illness and their safety so New
 
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital tries very hard to
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
accept the patients that truly require
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
that significant level of care and as
 
01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
Cindy mentioned there are patients who
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
are awaiting a level of service that
 
01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
could be served in another less
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment including one of
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
the designated receiving facilities ask
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up yeah I'm trying to
 
01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
understand this system better so
 
01:57:18.069 --> 01:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
um like if I come into a mental health
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
center for acute depression suicidal
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
depression I can go go to one of any one
 
01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
of these eight places but if I'm you
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
know violent or something like that then
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
nope you don't go to these seven you go
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire mental house was that
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
correct does that aggravate the queue is
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
what I'm getting at I I think one of the
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
in cend you can jump in I think one of
 
01:57:39.069 --> 01:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
the other things to take into
 
01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:41.719 align:start position:0%
consideration here is the vast majority
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
of patients who are currently residing
 
01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital are there um
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
via a court order so they're there
 
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
essentially against their will um the
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
other designated receiving facilities
 
01:57:57.790 --> 01:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
tend to take individuals who are
 
01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
slightly less um severe might be
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
voluntarily seeking treatment or support
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
or might have a guardian who is um
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
getting that level of support on their
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
behalf okay um is a quick representative
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
Edwood we need to move on uh yes yes sir
 
01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just going to ask that when um
 
01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital comes to
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
division three for the budget part of it
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
that uh we we think we've been funding
 
01:58:26.669 --> 01:58:26.679 align:start position:0%
the system of care so that there's a
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
place to move patients out of your
 
01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
facility into a step down environment
 
01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
and so this is new news and if you could
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
be prepared to come tell us what what we
 
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
haven't done because we think we've been
 
01:58:42.669 --> 01:58:42.679 align:start position:0%
addressing this problem so be happy too
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative and
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much thank you um
 
01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.189 align:start position:0%
good
morning

01:59:06.189 --> 01:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
microphone good morning good morning
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's working better uh nice to see you
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
those of you that I know I see some
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
familiar faces and nice to meet you
 
01:59:16.229 --> 01:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
everybody else my name is Meredith tus
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of our division of
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
program quality and integrity and for
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
those of you that are familiar with the
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
Department you may recognize that name
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
or a relatively new division we were
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
created at the beginning of 2020 so
 
01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
we're entering our third year so I won't
 
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
be able to say we're new for much longer
 
01:59:33.149 --> 01:59:33.159 align:start position:0%
but some of you may be familiar with the
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
Department organization and this is a
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
newer division uh we consist of three
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
parts the Bureau of program quality the
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of program integrity and the
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
office of internal audit the office of
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
internal audit um is currently an
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
unfunded position but that is exactly
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
what it sounds like they do internal
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
audits at the request of management and
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
report back to management on any areas
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
programs or functions that they would
 
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
like to receive a
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
review the Bureau of program Integrity
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh does all kinds of functions
 
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
internally and externally including um
 
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring our external service
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
providers mostly in a financial capacity
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
for contract compliance and we do
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
federal subrecipient monitoring we uh
 
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
Lia with program areas that are
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
receiving Federal audits to make sure
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
that they're responsive to the Auditors
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
and if there are any federal audit
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
findings that they're appropriately
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
followed up on we do fraud waste and
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
abuse on behalf of the Medicaid Program
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
and food stamp program for Medicaid
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
providers and for
 
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries uh and we also do food
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
stamp eligibility reviews which is a a
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
federally mandated review process where
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
we look at food stamp eligibility and
 
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
whether it was done accurately or not um
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
I think that is most of program quality
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
and on the program sorry program
 
02:00:59.310 --> 02:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
Integrity uh program quality supports uh
 
02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
all the programs across the department
 
02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
but particularly Medicaid mental health
 
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder in uh
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
establishing quality metrics and doing
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
data analysis and data review and data
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
Integrity processes for the on behalf of
 
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
those three program
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
areas um program quality is also
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
involved in helping to
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
create uh audits of programs or service
 
02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
providers as it relates to their
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
clinical quality or service oper
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
operation and that is the Bureau of
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
program quality and uh they're also
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
engaged in contracts quality management
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
which is where we work with the
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
different program areas in the
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
department to determine uh from a high
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
level how the contracts they're engaged
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
in align with their strateg IC goals and
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
what are the key performance indicators
 
02:01:57.149 --> 02:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
that would relate to those strategic
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
goals and how are you going to measure
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
that as it relates to this contract to
 
02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that the quality you expect from
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
this contract is coming through and that
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
is our Bureau of program quality and
 
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
those are our three
 
02:02:14.669 --> 02:02:14.679 align:start position:0%
areas there any questions related to
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
that I see a hand up
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere just not program Integrity is
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
actually where I work to see you again
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
director good to see you representative
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
good to be
 
02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
here no questions okay great thank you
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
you good morning thank you for having me
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Melissa Hardy and I am the
 
02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
division director for long-term supports
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
and services um so in a in a nutshell we
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
work on um closely with Community
 
02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
Partners and families and individuals to
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
meet their needs in the community so our
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
division is made up of three bureaus one
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
is the Bureau of Developmental Services
 
02:03:06.990 --> 02:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
one is the Bureau of elderly and Adult
 
02:03:09.390 --> 02:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
Services and we also have the Bureau of
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
family um centered services so I'll
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
start with the Bureau of Developmental
 
02:03:18.069 --> 02:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
Services we have three
 
02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
1915c waiver programs in the bureau bu
 
02:03:26.069 --> 02:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
of Developmental Services which um one
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
is for children one is for folks with
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and the third
 
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
waiver um is for folks with acquire
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
brain disorders so those waivers um help
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
and support individuals and families to
 
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
stay in the community and receive
 
02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
Services um to keep them in the
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
community um The Bureau also for uh
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental servic has U
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
close Partnerships with area agencies
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
there's 10 area agencies throughout New
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are Service delivery
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
system um so those area agencies
 
02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
coordinate services with individuals and
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
families um contract with providers um
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
to to receive um and to coordinate
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
services for BDS we are currently um
 
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
undergoing a a systems change as we call
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
it so looking at four different areas
 
02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
that we're currently working on um one
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
is looking at Medicaid rates what we're
 
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursing our providers um so we're
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
working with a a contracted actuary to
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
look at the costs and develop
 
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
rates we also are looking at our waiver
 
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
Services what are um included and what
 
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
could be included looking at other
 
02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
states uh getting feedback from our
 
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and individuals that
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
receive services to see if we can
 
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
enhance what we have on those waivers
 
02:04:56.189 --> 02:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
we're also um as part of this plan going
 
02:04:59.069 --> 02:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
over our it system currently uh we have
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
a very Antiquated information technology
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
system where um I could say that we do a
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
lot of work in Excel spreadsheets to
 
02:05:09.629 --> 02:05:09.639 align:start position:0%
look at our budgets and and do our
 
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
calculations so we're really excited to
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
have our it systems more automated which
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
will make um you know things definitely
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
easier and more streamlined and then
 
02:05:22.270 --> 02:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at what we call our
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment services uh we
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
currently have folks that are being
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
served out of state uh because there
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
isn't enough infrastructure in New
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for those who require uh more
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
intense treatment services so we're
 
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
looking at building our capacity in New
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so people don't have to go
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
out of state and also so we can bring
 
02:05:45.229 --> 02:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
folks back into state to be closer to
 
02:05:45.239 --> 02:05:46.910 align:start position:0%
folks back into state to be closer to
their

02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
families the Bureau of elderly and Adult
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
Services um is is a large um part of our
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
work as well part of uh Bureau and of
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
elderly and Adult Services is the um
 
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
Adult Protective Services which I'm sure
 
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
you've heard of so investigations of
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
reports of abuse neglect or exploitation
 
02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
um so we have a a subdepartment for
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
those APS workers beas also has um a
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
1915 C Medicaid ww called choices for
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
Independence where folks um to be
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
qualified for that waiver have to be at
 
02:06:26.109 --> 02:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
a nursing home level of care um but
 
02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
would receive um community services so
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
they can stay in their Community versus
 
02:06:32.549 --> 02:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
going into a nursing
 
02:06:36.549 --> 02:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
facility theas also um manages our
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
service link which is our um aging and
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
disability Resource Center so their
 
02:06:43.149 --> 02:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
physical locations in the community
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
where folks can make an appointment or
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
walk in kind of like a One-Stop shop to
 
02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
um connect families and individuals with
 
02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
services um do information and referrals
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
do some Options
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
Counseling um so we have Sur link we
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
also have um other um funding such as
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
the older Americans Act and the social
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
service block grants which fund things
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
like senior centers
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh meal Zone wheels or
 
02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:12.350 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh meal Zone wheels or
congregate

02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
congregate
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
meals um and other um and other services
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
to keep people in the community who who
 
02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily meet medic level of
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
care and then our uh Bureau of family
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
centered Services there it's for
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
children with special Health Care needs
 
02:07:33.549 --> 02:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
um so we have um intervention service
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
early intervention services for children
 
02:07:38.109 --> 02:07:38.119 align:start position:0%

02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
have a developmental delay um an
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
established condition or who may be at
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
risk for a developmental delay so that
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
Bureau really supports families in
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%

02:08:03.549 --> 02:08:03.559 align:start position:0%

liaison for the Bureau of Developmental
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%

neth so that's what I have so thank you
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
very much for having me yes
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative we have a question
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman also thank you
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
for taking the question in regards
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
to I understand this
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
correctly when we looking for elderly
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
and Adult
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
Services what is the state of New
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doing to try to encourage
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
people to age in place versus being
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
placed in a nursing home because for two
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
reasons one is that's where they want to
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
be and number two it's less costly
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
Absolut so what are we doing as far as
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
the state goes back to maybe
 
02:08:53.790 --> 02:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards in the finance
 
02:08:55.950 --> 02:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
committee but how do we somehow help
 
02:08:58.830 --> 02:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
people shift from the nursing home care
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
to staying at home care and fund it
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
accordingly so we actually can save some
 
02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
money and I'll help improve the
 
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
patient's care um I want to say I want
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
to start off thank you for the question
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
um recently um at the end of last year
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
the the bureau received um Federal grant
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
for Money Follows the person um I which
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
is you know to either transition folks
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
out of nursing homes into the community
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
or develop systems of care in the
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
community to keep folks into the
 
02:09:28.589 --> 02:09:28.599 align:start position:0%
community so we're excited um that we
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
were awarded that Grant which will
 
02:09:34.549 --> 02:09:34.559 align:start position:0%
provide um to employees in that in that
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
um program to help just that how do we
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
deliver a service of care to keep people
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
in the community as you said less costly
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
um you know our nursing facilities
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
certainly have Staffing concerns as well
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh but also our our community providers
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
have Staffing concerns so looking at um
 
02:09:54.669 --> 02:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
the rates that we're providing or
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for our choices for
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
Independence waiver I think would be a

we just marked the first year of that
 
02:12:47.950 --> 02:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
new system which is a community-based
 
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
response mobile crisis response through

a Central Access
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%

behalf of the division on many
legislative

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
issues we have our guiding principles
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
that come from plans and from blueprints
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
so everything that we come for you to
 
02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
discuss ties into one of these plans if
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
not all of them and that includes our
 
02:13:32.109 --> 02:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan which was
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
established in
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
2019 and we've made great strides as
 
02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the New Hampshire rapid
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
response uh mobile crisis was a result
 
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
um of one of the recommendations in that
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
plan we also have the children's system
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
of care and so again looking at
 
02:13:52.990 --> 02:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
everything that we do being Guided by
 
02:13:55.950 --> 02:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan and the system of care
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
and then we also work very closely with
 
02:14:00.589 --> 02:14:00.599 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs they um were essentially the
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
Fiscal Agent and um the executive
 
02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
director of our Bureau of drug and
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol Services I the director is the
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
executive director for the Governor's
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
commission and so they have um an action
 
02:14:20.549 --> 02:14:20.559 align:start position:0%
plan that they just established um later
 
02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh that's a three-year action
 
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
plan and um much of the thread this
 
02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
morning addressed um substance misuse
 
02:14:34.270 --> 02:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
and Mental Health Services when we think
 
02:14:36.629 --> 02:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
of our division it's really focused on
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
the communitybased side and um we'll be
 
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
talking as we go through our budget and
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
with finance division 3 a lot more about
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
how those Community Based Services um do
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
um serve the purpose of uh diverting
 
02:14:56.910 --> 02:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
people from entering a more acute phase
 
02:14:56.920 --> 02:14:58.270 align:start position:0%
people from entering a more acute phase
of

02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
need and with that I'll
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
conclude thank you yes representative
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'll try to make this into a
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
question uh the um you mentioned the
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and and as I understand
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
that that's updated Contin
 
02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
L that could serve as a extremely
 
02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
important document for both the health
 
02:15:33.549 --> 02:15:33.559 align:start position:0%
committee and the finance division so
 
02:15:37.149 --> 02:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if if you could get the
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
most upto-date
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
plan uh for our committee and for
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
division and finance so that they could
 
02:15:50.549 --> 02:15:50.559 align:start position:0%
use that as a policy guide uh for all of
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
the work work I did the last one as
 
02:15:58.430 --> 02:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
chairman of the 10-year plan and not a
 
02:16:02.109 --> 02:16:02.119 align:start position:0%
single thing was ever done uh so I've
 
02:16:04.109 --> 02:16:04.119 align:start position:0%
been an advocate ever since that we
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
don't waste our money and that when we
 
02:16:08.589 --> 02:16:08.599 align:start position:0%
have a a
 
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
very useful document that we should make
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
the best use of it thank you very much
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your good work so I'll
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
be happy to share um the 10e plan that
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
was established in uh 2019 as well as
 
02:16:25.870 --> 02:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
the key accomplishments we also have a
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
document that accompanies that and it's
 
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
because of the Good Fortune of the work
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
of the governor and the legislature that
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
we have been able to make significant
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
progress um on this most recent 10-year
 
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
plan um the the previous one hit a
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
recession and so
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%

long-term care on budsman which is uh
 
02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%

02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
facilities and assist in um helping with
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that they may have with their
 
02:19:28.509 --> 02:19:28.519 align:start position:0%

02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
the you know the food I mean it really
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%

busman's office go goes and does that
 
02:19:41.519 --> 02:19:43.110 align:start position:0%
busman's office go goes and does that
work

02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
um I think that's everything except for
 
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
legislative Services I also over um seee
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
some legislative Services although John
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
Williams um as most of you know uh
 
02:19:55.950 --> 02:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
handles the bulk of that work but um for
 
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
big items um at the department things
 
02:20:00.030 --> 02:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
that we'll have a significant impact you
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
will see me uh present in front of not
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
only this committee but many others uh
 
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
related to you know significant issues
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
that occur and I'm I'm always in the
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
background kind of assisting um with
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
with the legislative process so I unless
 
02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
I have other questions I'll just um have
 
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
John come up and and close it out
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I believe has a
 
02:20:22.429 --> 02:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
question for you sure thank you Mr chair
 
02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
I I think we just found the busiest
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
person in the department and uh I I I
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
think you at least used to have an
 
02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
additional title of being the
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
Department's privacy officer is that
 
02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
correct so I no there is a privacy
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
officer at the department they are in
 
02:20:40.750 --> 02:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
the legal department um and that is
 
02:20:43.150 --> 02:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
Kathy burnhard so she's always been the
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
privacy officer but but she reports up
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
to up through the legal department so
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
through me she reports to you is that
 
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to she reports to
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
Frank knockman who is the um head of the
 
02:20:56.710 --> 02:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
legal Bureau who and then Frank reports
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
to me so we all we all take an interest
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
in privacy matters okay
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
thanks okay I think that's all did you
 
02:21:07.469 --> 02:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
have a question okay I'll let John close
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%

and I just wanted to leave with you some
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
material and happy to go over um
 
02:43:23.389 --> 02:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
any of this um offline or at any time in
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
the future and sometimes the bills that
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
come in front of you um this material is
 
02:43:31.429 --> 02:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
relevant but I wanted to start off with
 
02:43:34.190 --> 02:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
um every year we update the what we call
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
the hospital fa sheet so that is this
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
document um that has a lot of um
 
02:43:41.630 --> 02:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
interesting tidbits about hospit the
 
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals all of our hospitals in the
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um are part of
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
the association including the Community
 
02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
Hospitals um which in comprise one
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
academic Medical Center Dartmouth
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock 12 large Community Hospitals
 
02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
which we reference as PPS hospitals
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
which means the prospective payment
 
02:44:04.710 --> 02:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
system under Medicare that is how
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're reimbursed and then critical
 
02:44:09.469 --> 02:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
access hospitals are we have 13 of them
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then we list them um in the on the
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
fact sheet additional information has to
 
02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
do with Community benefits and we
 
02:44:19.070 --> 02:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
actually have a um a specific report
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
report on community benefits hospitals
 
02:44:23.710 --> 02:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
um participate through the Attorney
 
02:44:26.670 --> 02:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
General's office um doing community
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
needs assessment periodically and we um
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
we do an anal they do an analysis of
 
02:44:35.830 --> 02:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
what are their top Community needs
 
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
assessments through their um surveys
 
02:44:39.950 --> 02:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
with their with their communities so
 
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
that's information that we have in here
 
02:44:46.590 --> 02:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
as well as something that is um we have
 
02:44:50.349 --> 02:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
a infographic on barriers to discharge
 
02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think um representative Nagel
 
02:44:54.349 --> 02:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
and others were talking about this
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
earlier what of some of our challenges
 
02:44:58.110 --> 02:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get patients out of the
 
02:45:01.150 --> 02:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
hospital we did an analysis um this
 
02:45:03.389 --> 02:45:03.399 align:start position:0%
Summer that has some interesting
 
02:45:05.950 --> 02:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
statistics and are somewhat alarming um
 
02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
relative to how many patients in a given
 
02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
um month and a half or so are in the
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
hospital unable to get out due to um
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
inability to move them into um a more
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate setting
 
02:45:21.190 --> 02:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
that means that there are a lot of
 
02:45:23.550 --> 02:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
unnecessary impatient days unfortunately
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of unreimbursed acute care costs
 
02:45:30.070 --> 02:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
because un um um one fact that I think
 
02:45:33.150 --> 02:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
is important is as people are if there's
 
02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:45.790 align:start position:0%
is important is as people are if there's
a

02:45:45.790 --> 02:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:48.349 --> 02:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
unmedicated and not by the third parties
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
so they are taking up a bed that
 
02:45:53.150 --> 02:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
prevents others from getting in the
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
other important statistic and I know
 
02:45:58.670 --> 02:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
some of you are um either retired um
 
02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians or current um active
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
Physicians occupancy rates um over 90%
 
02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
80 5% are are alarming and I understand
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
that there um so our occupancy rate
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
right now is very high um it has been
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
for some hospitals it's over 100% which
 
02:46:18.870 --> 02:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
Yes means that they have more patient
 
02:46:20.830 --> 02:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
patient in than they actually can can
 
02:46:23.429 --> 02:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
put in a bed um that is why some of them
 
02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
are in the emergency room unable to to
 
02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
move out our critical access hospitals
 
02:46:31.630 --> 02:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
our smaller hospitals usually stabilize
 
02:46:34.269 --> 02:46:34.279 align:start position:0%
and get them into an acute uh L uh
 
02:46:36.349 --> 02:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
tertiary care or one of the Community
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
Hospitals um the PPS larger hospitals
 
02:46:41.150 --> 02:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
they can't do that because the PPS
 
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals have no no space um so that is
 
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
very concerning um and as it states here
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
we've seen at 100% increase since the
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
prepandemic levels relative to our
 
02:46:55.870 --> 02:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
occupancy there is um on our website we
 
02:46:58.190 --> 02:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
have a more detailed report and I'm
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
happy to share that with you but if you
 
02:47:01.950 --> 02:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
want to just look at the more detailed
 
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
report it is on there the other um
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
infographic that we worked on this
 
02:47:10.510 --> 02:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
summer B is based on um some concerns
 
02:47:13.349 --> 02:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
that our CFOs had relative to the labor
 
02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
costs and um we've talked a lot about
 
02:47:19.389 --> 02:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages hospitals um are in
 
02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:21.399 align:start position:0%
the same boat that everyone else is in
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
relative to Workforce and what we have
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
had to um resort to is are use is using
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies which um have they've
 
02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
always used staffing agencies but never
 
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they have to use them
 
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
now which is causing um an enormous um
 
02:47:41.389 --> 02:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh labor cost um increase which this
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
infographic shows and again there is
 
02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
another more detailed report on our
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
website and I am happy to um um get any
 
02:47:52.070 --> 02:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
additional information for anyone that
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
um would be interested and I am I am uh
 
02:47:58.230 --> 02:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
in the way of your lunch so I will um
 
02:48:01.309 --> 02:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
stop there but happy to answer any
 
02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Edwards uh
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I think I have
 
02:48:08.429 --> 02:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
two separate ones I'll come back to you
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh to request permission to continue but
 
02:48:15.469 --> 02:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
um okay this first one barriers to
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
discharge uh I I think the graphic kind
 
02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
of buries the lead uh the two the two
 
02:48:25.269 --> 02:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
barriers that I'm seeing are barriers to
 
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
Guardianship and access to Medicaid for
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
long-term Services uh if those are the
 
02:48:35.309 --> 02:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
two critical barriers we we just had m m
 
02:48:36.870 --> 02:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
Hardy here from
 
02:48:40.030 --> 02:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
long-term service support so I would
 
02:48:43.590 --> 02:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
want to know to the extent to which you
 
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
all are working together because she may
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
be holding some solutions that could
 
02:48:49.230 --> 02:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
help m
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
that yes um this is actually this this
 
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
survey that we did this summer was
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
specific to those two specific issues
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
there are many barriers to discharge and
 
02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
we have had a more robust um reporting
 
02:49:05.950 --> 02:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
in the past but we focused on those two
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
issues we actually set up earlier this
 
02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
year and the department is participating
 
02:49:12.590 --> 02:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
we have an inter Agency workg Group that
 
02:49:16.110 --> 02:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
involves Miss Hardy and her um staff
 
02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
that you were introduced to today so yes
 
02:49:21.469 --> 02:49:21.479 align:start position:0%
we do have and um it also incl includes
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
the court system because of the
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
guardianship issue primarily Falls with
 
02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
judge king and um and and um the pro the
 
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
probate court so we have been meeting um
 
02:49:36.429 --> 02:49:36.439 align:start position:0%
roughly every two weeks for uh about
 
02:49:38.910 --> 02:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
three or four months trying
 
02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:40.670 align:start position:0%
three or four months trying
to

02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:49:43.469 --> 02:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
identify um tools and opportunities
 
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
where we can improve on those on those
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
issues but we um we believe that we
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
needed to do this survey to just
 
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the challenges
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
specific challenges in getting folks out
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
hospital follow up okay so this is this
 
02:50:04.229 --> 02:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
is still in the same Vein on uh on on
 
02:50:06.670 --> 02:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
the guardianship you're saying it's a a
 
02:50:08.269 --> 02:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
lot of it's dealing with our court
 
02:50:10.830 --> 02:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
system and I'm I I would just encourage
 
02:50:14.229 --> 02:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
you if you've not already uh just set up
 
02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
a meeting and talk to uh chairman Bob
 
02:50:19.870 --> 02:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
Lynn of the Judiciary uh I I I think he
 
02:50:22.349 --> 02:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
should have some situational awareness
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
to help overall great that's a comment Y
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
and then and then if I may uh a a
 
02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
different question Mr chair yeah go
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
ahead okay so um on the other graphic on
 
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
the labor cost survey you site um
 
02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:40.030 align:start position:0%
the labor cost survey you site um
670,000

02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
670,000
 
02:50:44.309 --> 02:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
er patients Ed patients and this is a a
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
tie into to the earlier uh conversation
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
I was asking the new New Hampshire
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
hospital uh I use the term warehousing
 
02:50:58.229 --> 02:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
they like the word q I think the the Q
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
obfuscates how horrible it is to
 
02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
Warehouse these patients in the ER and
 
02:51:06.590 --> 02:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
so so I'm curious as you guys are
 
02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
looking at this ER issue to what extent
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
are the is the hospital Association you
 
02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
know reporting up these this warehousing
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
problem and to and and where do you see
 
02:51:23.870 --> 02:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
that information uh getting into the
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
hands of the legislature so that we have
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
some situational awareness going on are
 
02:51:31.150 --> 02:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
you are you like bringing it to the HHS
 
02:51:33.309 --> 02:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
oversight or anything like that so we
 
02:51:36.990 --> 02:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
refer to them as Ed holds um and to we
 
02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
put everything on our website so at
 
02:51:41.349 --> 02:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
Daily we report um we update that on our
 
02:51:45.309 --> 02:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
website um the nha.org and right now we
 
02:51:46.269 --> 02:51:46.279 align:start position:0%
have about
 
02:51:49.950 --> 02:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
179 Ed holds um um some are behavioral
 
02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
health we have 53 I know New Hampshire
 
02:51:54.429 --> 02:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
hospital said 40 but those would
 
02:51:58.110 --> 02:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
probably be ieas um um inv voluntary
 
02:52:01.150 --> 02:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
admissions um and some and we report
 
02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
voluntary admissions as well and then we
 
02:52:07.229 --> 02:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
have 21 pediatric behavioral holds so
 
02:52:09.070 --> 02:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
yes all of that is updated on our
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
website and again um that's what these
 
02:52:16.110 --> 02:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
barriers to discharge um include folks
 
02:52:19.790 --> 02:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
that are it's not Co related it is just
 
02:52:24.030 --> 02:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
that 179 folks cannot get into a bed of
 
02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
some sort so
 
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to remember if I answered
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
your question you did it was excellent
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
and you guys are way on top of it and
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not so if you could if you could
 
02:52:39.429 --> 02:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
help me uh by uh emailing me the URL to
 
02:52:41.950 --> 02:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
the direct site y uh and then I'll make
 
02:52:44.429 --> 02:52:44.439 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone on oversight has it
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you you're welcome okay
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes go ahead head thank you Mr chair
 
02:52:52.190 --> 02:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for my question Paul of
 
02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:53.229 align:start position:0%
and thank you for my question Paul of
course

02:52:53.229 --> 02:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
um as you know and we know Hospital
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
bottom lines are usually running at
 
02:52:59.429 --> 02:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
margins of 1% if we're lucky unlike
 
02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
other Industries and so you would say to
 
02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
yourself if you're running at 110% which
 
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth was this morning you would say
 
02:53:07.469 --> 02:53:07.479 align:start position:0%
how would they ever go out of business
 
02:53:08.750 --> 02:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
because they're just full but we know
 
02:53:10.750 --> 02:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
that because of shutting beds and
 
02:53:12.229 --> 02:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
Staffing shortage and discharge
 
02:53:14.830 --> 02:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
capabilities are diminished my question
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
is are we aware of especially as we are
 
02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the potential for a Medicaid
 
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
expansion you know um stop um are we
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
aware of any hospitals that are in Risk
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
right now of potential closure um we
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
have shut down previously nursing homes
 
02:53:34.830 --> 02:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
because of re reimbursements and you
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
know hospitals in the state have closed
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
so are we aware of any hospitals that
 
02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
are in such a perilous position where
 
02:53:43.309 --> 02:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
they may close at any point in the near
 
02:53:47.309 --> 02:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
future um I do not have um I'm not aware
 
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
of that information how however you're
 
02:53:51.269 --> 02:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
right representative Murphy that um they
 
02:53:54.070 --> 02:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
are full but they're not um doing well
 
02:53:56.229 --> 02:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
financially um and we are working
 
02:53:58.950 --> 02:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
actually on our latest operating margin
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
report that I hopefully will have soon
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
that looks at that statistic and you're
 
02:54:08.030 --> 02:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
it because they're full and but some of
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
them are not reimbursed
 
02:54:14.229 --> 02:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
um um patients that is a big problem
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
because again you can't get them out and
 
02:54:19.830 --> 02:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
you can't get folks in um so it is it is
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
um it's becoming a crisis um to be
 
02:54:25.590 --> 02:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
honest um but as far as individual
 
02:54:28.349 --> 02:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
hospitals closing not at this not at
 
02:54:31.309 --> 02:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
this time but they are um in in Dire
 
02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
Straits in some areas of the state for
 
02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
sure and one thing thank you for
 
02:54:38.750 --> 02:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
reminding me um one thing that we are
 
02:54:40.670 --> 02:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
very supportive of in addition to
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion we are 100%
 
02:54:45.670 --> 02:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
supportive of um permanent
 
02:54:47.550 --> 02:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
reauthorization of Medicaid expansion
 
02:54:49.389 --> 02:54:49.399 align:start position:0%
and more to come on that in the coming
 
02:54:52.550 --> 02:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
months but um in addition to long-term
 
02:54:55.950 --> 02:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
services and support we want to support
 
02:54:58.870 --> 02:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases for long-term
 
02:55:01.229 --> 02:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
services and support to include nursing
 
02:55:03.630 --> 02:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
homes as well as community- Based
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
Services because as someone has stated
 
02:55:08.269 --> 02:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's not always appropriate to have an
 
02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
individual go to a nursing home but of
 
02:55:13.150 --> 02:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
course a lot of patients that are in a
 
02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
hospital need a rehab bed um and some of
 
02:55:18.309 --> 02:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
those are provided in um in long-term
 
02:55:20.830 --> 02:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
term care facilities and sometimes they
 
02:55:22.710 --> 02:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
just unfortunately just need to be in a
 
02:55:25.469 --> 02:55:25.479 align:start position:0%
nursing home and we just there is no
 
02:55:28.269 --> 02:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
Staffing available to staff those beds
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
safely in nursing homes so that I think
 
02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
you will hear a lot more about in the
 
02:55:35.630 --> 02:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
and certainly um during the budget phase
 
02:55:37.950 --> 02:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
in um and then certainly in front of
 
02:55:40.750 --> 02:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
your committee as well so thank
 
02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
you okay did you have a question
 
02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:46.190 align:start position:0%
you okay did you have a question
representative

02:55:46.190 --> 02:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:55:48.510 --> 02:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman it's thank
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
you Paula Miss man nice to see you um so
 
02:55:56.229 --> 02:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh welcome back thank you
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
and um this may take a little bit of
 
02:56:01.630 --> 02:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
development uh so in August I had a
 
02:56:06.269 --> 02:56:06.279 align:start position:0%
cranky gallbladder removed and um I I
 
02:56:08.950 --> 02:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
will say that while I was in the New
 
02:56:10.269 --> 02:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Southern New
 
02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I had very good care and uh
 
02:56:16.229 --> 02:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
they eventually had to move me to
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because uh Department
 
02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have the beds for me so I I ended
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
up going to
 
02:56:26.469 --> 02:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
Ley um who had the facilities to be able
 
02:56:31.150 --> 02:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
to handle my cranky gallbladder um so
 
02:56:33.630 --> 02:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
um while I was in there I found out that
 
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
there was an
 
02:56:37.790 --> 02:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
entire Wing that had been shut down
 
02:56:40.590 --> 02:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
because they just couldn't staff it and
 
02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
I think this goes to what uh um
 
02:56:46.269 --> 02:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards mentioned before
 
02:56:48.910 --> 02:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
and um and the Young young lady I can't
 
02:56:51.070 --> 02:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
remember her name um at the beginning
 
02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
talking about you know how do we how do
 
02:56:58.349 --> 02:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
we get uh um to supply the the the
 
02:57:01.070 --> 02:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
nursing and the doctors that you need in
 
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
order to run the
 
02:57:06.309 --> 02:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
facility uh so that's I guess that's my
 
02:57:08.229 --> 02:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
main thing I'm looking at this from a
 
02:57:10.269 --> 02:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
business perspective because that's what
 
02:57:16.229 --> 02:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
my background was before I retired and I
 
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just now getting bills from things
 
02:57:20.990 --> 02:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
that I did in
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
March and uh usually in business we get
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
thumped on pretty hard if we weren't
 
02:57:31.110 --> 02:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
calling in our account receivables and
 
02:57:34.429 --> 02:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
if um and I'm sure some of this has
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
something to do with the insurance
 
02:57:38.269 --> 02:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
companies and and getting their response
 
02:57:39.790 --> 02:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
before they can actually send out bills
 
02:57:42.990 --> 02:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
to the customers but it you know if
 
02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
you're waiting nine months for a payment
 
02:57:48.910 --> 02:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
from me then I don't feel like uh
 
02:57:52.030 --> 02:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
there's a real Rush on on getting paid
 
02:57:54.590 --> 02:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
which in you know through what my work
 
02:57:57.429 --> 02:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
on the committee I can tell you I can
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
tell anybody that you're definitely in
 
02:58:05.990 --> 02:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
dire need of funding so um that's I
 
02:58:08.790 --> 02:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
think I I I see several different
 
02:58:12.750 --> 02:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
avenues that um you can grow in and I'm
 
02:58:15.190 --> 02:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
just wondering if um you know from a
 
02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
business perspective how are we handling
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
um uh the the Personnel to bill the
 
02:58:25.309 --> 02:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
Personnel to be able to handle and not
 
02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
close down wings of hospitals thank you
 
02:58:31.510 --> 02:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
um when you mentioned uh closing can I
 
02:58:33.990 --> 02:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
just I get a ask a clarifying question
 
02:58:36.349 --> 02:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
were you referring to a wing being
 
02:58:37.870 --> 02:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
closed at Southern New Hampshire Medical
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
Center or at Ley um at uh New Hampshire
 
02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:41.830 align:start position:0%
Center or at Ley um at uh New Hampshire
I'm

02:58:41.830 --> 02:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
sorry okay um so yes there are staff
 
02:58:46.630 --> 02:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
beds and there are license beds and
 
02:58:49.070 --> 02:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's your I think the the Crux of your
 
02:58:51.349 --> 02:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
um comment so the hospitals are licensed
 
02:58:52.950 --> 02:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
for a certain number of beds through
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
Health Facilities which you heard um
 
02:58:57.389 --> 02:58:57.399 align:start position:0%
Dorian Shockley and Melissa St sier
 
02:59:00.590 --> 02:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
oversee Health Facilities licensing the
 
02:59:03.469 --> 02:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
staff beds are a diff is a different um
 
02:59:06.030 --> 02:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
number and some hospitals have had to
 
02:59:09.309 --> 02:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
limit their um their beds because they
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
cannot staff them again sort of like um
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
similar to long-term care not as acute a
 
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
problem I think as long-term long-term
 
02:59:20.190 --> 02:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
care because they are paying those
 
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
outrageous um staffing agency rates to
 
02:59:25.630 --> 02:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
bring in the nurses CU they have to um
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
and it's primarily nurses I shouldn't
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
say only nurses but primarily nurses um
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
so though that is one issue um and staff
 
02:59:36.630 --> 02:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
and Workforce is a very important issue
 
02:59:39.469 --> 02:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
I think what would be interesting is the
 
02:59:41.510 --> 02:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
um through the Endowment for health the
 
02:59:44.590 --> 02:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
forward fund um has been working on this
 
02:59:48.030 --> 02:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
long on this issue for healthc care work
 
02:59:50.750 --> 02:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
Force for a while and there is a lot
 
02:59:53.070 --> 02:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
more information um relative to trying
 
02:59:56.349 --> 02:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
to to figure out um long-term solution
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
short-term and long-term solutions to
 
03:00:01.550 --> 03:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
Health Care Workforce shortages
 
03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so um I think more
 
03:00:07.870 --> 03:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
to come on that but yes it is it is a a
 
03:00:10.670 --> 03:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing issue and we support they don't
 
03:00:12.150 --> 03:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
come in front of this committee but we
 
03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
support any and all efforts um of oplc
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
Office Professional Licensing and
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
certification that usually is an Edna um
 
03:00:22.710 --> 03:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
um committee that they go in front of
 
03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
but trying to streamline the licensing
 
03:00:27.269 --> 03:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
process licensing is very important
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
licensing of clinicians not licensing of
 
03:00:31.229 --> 03:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
Health Facilities but licensing of
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
clinicians because we need them to be
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
the public needs to be protected however
 
03:00:37.790 --> 03:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that that process
 
03:00:40.349 --> 03:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
is as streamlined as possible accounts
 
03:00:42.830 --> 03:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
receivable um I was not really prepared
 
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
to um address that but I appreciate you
 
03:00:48.110 --> 03:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
raising the issue um yes our Hospital
 
03:00:49.870 --> 03:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
are struggling with accounts receivable
 
03:00:51.790 --> 03:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
and you are absolutely right you can't
 
03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get a bill until um
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
the insurance company has processed the
 
03:00:57.269 --> 03:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
claim because that would be
 
03:00:59.510 --> 03:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate because um we need to know
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
what the insurer is going to pay before
 
03:01:06.630 --> 03:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
if if you in fact have any balance um if
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's a deductible co- Insurance co-pay
 
03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and and it wouldn't be a
 
03:01:13.950 --> 03:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
co-pay for inati but um so they have to
 
03:01:16.190 --> 03:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
wait for it to process and that actually
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
you have identified another issue that
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're having with insurance companies
 
03:01:23.550 --> 03:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
our accounts receivable we also do we do
 
03:01:26.309 --> 03:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of surveys another survey we do um
 
03:01:28.030 --> 03:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
and have been doing for about a year and
 
03:01:30.349 --> 03:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
a half um has to do with our hospitals
 
03:01:33.150 --> 03:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
accounts receivable again that's another
 
03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
problem that is um like you said you're
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
you have identified a multitude of
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
problems that's why I think our system
 
03:01:42.910 --> 03:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
is is in a bit of um crisis right now
 
03:01:45.710 --> 03:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
because we are um struggling with having
 
03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
accounts receivable anything over 90
 
03:01:50.229 --> 03:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
days is considered a kind of a red flag
 
03:01:53.550 --> 03:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
for a CFO we have a lot of accounts over
 
03:01:56.190 --> 03:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
90 days and I think you're an an example
 
03:01:59.349 --> 03:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
of one unfortunately that we did not get
 
03:02:00.790 --> 03:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
re they the hospitals didn't get
 
03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursed in in um timely manner and so
 
03:02:07.630 --> 03:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um that delays getting
 
03:02:09.990 --> 03:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and delays getting the bill
 
03:02:12.030 --> 03:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
to you and it confuses the patient of
 
03:02:14.429 --> 03:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
course they're like what is this I I was
 
03:02:17.190 --> 03:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
there in March like you said so um that
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
is another issue that we're struggling
 
03:02:21.150 --> 03:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
with and we do have a couple bills
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
actually that we're working on in the
 
03:02:26.469 --> 03:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
Senate um to try to address some of that
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
that Pro problem okay thank you Miss
 
03:02:33.389 --> 03:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:35.870 --> 03:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative yes go ahead Leah
 
03:02:37.950 --> 03:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative kosman thank you Mr
 
03:02:39.229 --> 03:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:02:42.670 --> 03:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
question um so I've received a lot of
 
03:02:45.510 --> 03:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
calls since um you know the roll out of
 
03:02:47.550 --> 03:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccines and when New
 
03:02:49.550 --> 03:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure um hospitals started
 
03:02:51.870 --> 03:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
mandating that um they've lost a lot of
 
03:02:53.389 --> 03:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
Staff because of it and I know that
 
03:02:55.870 --> 03:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of PE um prospective
 
03:02:58.630 --> 03:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
nursing um students who have been trying
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
to do their clinicals at hospitals in
 
03:03:03.150 --> 03:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um because it's
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
required they haven't been able to and
 
03:03:06.190 --> 03:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
they can't complete their education
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
programs and we're we're put you know
 
03:03:11.190 --> 03:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're putting a cork in the in the
 
03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
Stream of potential new workers for this
 
03:03:18.750 --> 03:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
shortage and I was was just wondering if
 
03:03:21.150 --> 03:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
since the new information about the
 
03:03:23.550 --> 03:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
Dismal e efficacy and by some measures
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
negative efficacy of the vaccines and
 
03:03:28.349 --> 03:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
the injuries if the hospitalization
 
03:03:30.550 --> 03:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association is doing any
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
surveys or taking another look at um
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
their approach to covid vaccination for
 
03:03:40.030 --> 03:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
staff and if they um if you guys are
 
03:03:42.349 --> 03:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
considering retracting that um
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation that all hospitals
 
03:03:46.990 --> 03:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
require it because I think that that if
 
03:03:49.590 --> 03:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
they loosen up some of those regulations
 
03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
um it can help with bringing new people
 
03:03:53.630 --> 03:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
into the workforce and bringing back
 
03:03:56.110 --> 03:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
people who left um thank you for your
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
question um I our data that we have
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
collected from the hospitals um would be
 
03:04:04.510 --> 03:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
um counter to some of the um data that
 
03:04:07.070 --> 03:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
you have stated representative um we
 
03:04:09.550 --> 03:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
have hospitals that have stated they did
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
not lose staff because of the
 
03:04:13.630 --> 03:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
requirement which is actually a CMS
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
requirement and I think we've gone over
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
this um in this committee so I will not
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
the labor the point but um the hospitals
 
03:04:23.110 --> 03:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
in order to be a CMS um certified
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
provider meaning Medicare and Medicaid
 
03:04:29.670 --> 03:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
they must um mandate um that covid um
 
03:04:33.710 --> 03:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines be um required at all hospitals
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
which they do and but there are
 
03:04:38.030 --> 03:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions for medical and religious
 
03:04:40.469 --> 03:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
exemptions which they um adhere to and
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
CMS reviews um so does the joint
 
03:04:44.910 --> 03:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
commission and dnv which is another
 
03:04:47.110 --> 03:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
accrediting agency to make sure that
 
03:04:50.110 --> 03:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
they are um complying with the CMS
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that they in fact um have
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
this um um for all it's the safety of
 
03:04:58.389 --> 03:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
the patients as well as the staff and
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
visitors so um I won't belabor that
 
03:05:03.229 --> 03:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
point but um I our statistics actually
 
03:05:06.510 --> 03:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
show um that we do not have um that
 
03:05:08.670 --> 03:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
issue and that is not the issue that um
 
03:05:11.469 --> 03:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
why folks um we have a staffing shortage
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
um there's a staffing shortage around um
 
03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
the country and certainly within all of
 
03:05:18.990 --> 03:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
healthc care and Beyond healthcare for
 
03:05:21.510 --> 03:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
that matter so um and they do require
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
flu vaccines which they have for a long
 
03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
time so um I I also have not heard that
 
03:05:30.389 --> 03:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
um issue with the nurses um the nursing
 
03:05:32.950 --> 03:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
um schools but our hospitals work very
 
03:05:34.670 --> 03:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
closely with them so I can certainly
 
03:05:37.630 --> 03:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
follow up all set uh representative Leon
 
03:05:40.070 --> 03:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
has the last question um thank you thank
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Miss
 
03:05:43.790 --> 03:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
manahan for being here this is more of a
 
03:05:45.110 --> 03:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up question and one where I'm
 
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
looking for just a short response of yes
 
03:05:49.950 --> 03:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
no or off follow up with you um would
 
03:05:52.070 --> 03:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
there be any interest if there are data
 
03:05:54.110 --> 03:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
to show that our healthc care provider
 
03:05:55.670 --> 03:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
pipeline has been restricted by the
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate to support a waiver to
 
03:06:01.950 --> 03:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
CMS for that if we do have data to show
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
that that's impacting our
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
Readiness I would need to better
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
understand that um I don't know how
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
exactly that would work this is a
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
national um HHS at the national level um
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
requires that this um this man this
 
03:06:19.870 --> 03:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
mandate this re this um requirement so
 
03:06:21.070 --> 03:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
I'll take that as a we'll follow up
 
03:06:23.349 --> 03:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
afterwards sure happy too thank you okay
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%

was created during the 2019 legislative
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
session primarily uh with a charge to
 
03:07:28.150 --> 03:07:28.160 align:start position:0%

we are separate from any other state
 
03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
agency part of the purpose of creating
 
03:07:48.990 --> 03:07:49.000 align:start position:0%

03:07:50.950 --> 03:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
the silos the various State agencies and
 
03:07:53.710 --> 03:07:53.720 align:start position:0%

strategic map um you can see what
 
03:10:55.750 --> 03:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
motivates our investigation of issues um
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
we've really getting off the ground
 
03:10:59.870 --> 03:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
getting our s established we spent a
 
03:11:02.269 --> 03:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
great deal of time this past year
 
03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
several years studying the issues that
 
03:11:07.950 --> 03:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
come before you um we had our our
 
03:11:09.870 --> 03:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
commission meets monthly and in addition
 
03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:11.640 align:start position:0%

that meet monthly in addition to our
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
policy team so top issues that we will
 
03:11:18.070 --> 03:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
likely be address addressing with you
 
03:11:20.790 --> 03:11:20.800 align:start position:0%

03:11:22.910 --> 03:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
system of care for healthy aging there's
 
03:11:24.110 --> 03:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
a Senate bill that would be coming
 
03:11:25.550 --> 03:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
forward to address many of the issues

thank you Mr chair two-part question
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
what's your annual budget uh I'd like to
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
know how much of that's General funds
 
03:12:09.630 --> 03:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
and which uh uh division of finance
 
03:12:12.309 --> 03:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
reviews your the governor's portion of
 
03:12:16.990 --> 03:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
your budget okay so um annual budget is
 
03:12:18.870 --> 03:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh I have to double check but I believe
 
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's between 150 and
 
03:12:24.750 --> 03:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
175,000 um I think it's at the 150 end
 
03:12:28.349 --> 03:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
and uh it is General funds and we are
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
