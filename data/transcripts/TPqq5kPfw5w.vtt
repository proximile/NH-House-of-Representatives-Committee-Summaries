00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is kind of refreshing for me because this is the way the committee room was always supposed to look to me.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I remember that.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.500
And that in the old days, when we did subcommittees, we would just all sit down at that end.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.000
But a committee conference was this, looking across from each other.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.500
So this is nice to have this on our final day.

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Well, good morning.

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.500
So good morning.

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
All right.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.000
So do you want us to start?

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I get, yeah.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
I mean, I assume we're all set now, right?

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:28.000
Yeah, we're going to take 354 and 555 off it and pass it 1380 as is right so the motion will be a c to the house position period yep appreciate it very much yep thank you very much um all those in favor of that motion please say aye aye i suppose.

19
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we're all set.

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Awesome.

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Thanks.

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Thank you very much.

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Thank you for having me.

24
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Always a pleasure.

25
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
That was really good.

26
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
We'll see you in Ringe sometime.

27
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Appreciate it.

29
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
Thank you.

30
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Thank you.

31
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Thank you.

32
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
Thank you.

33
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Thank you.

34
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500
Thank you.

35
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
Thank you.

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
Thank you.

37
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500
Thank you.

38
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.500
Thank you.

39
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Thank you.

40
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Thank you.

41
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500
Thank you.

42
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
Thank you.

43
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Thank you.

44
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
Thank you.

45
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500
Thank you.

46
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.500
this bill without the military installation.

47
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.000
So to see how you guys are with this.

48
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I would say that in terms of if you're not willing to take it off and we're not willing to sign off on it, it would be the underlying bill, the liquor bill, has a big impact on almost every beverage manufacturer in the state because they all go into these tenant and contract manufacturing contracts.

49
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:12.500
But not alone in that, we also will lose an opportunity of another guy who has come from Maine and wanted to manufacture here in the state.

50
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.000
We can't do it unless we pass this bill.

51
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.500
So there's so many pieces that we would be very sad if we don't pass this bill.

52
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:34.000
But like I say, the military installation, there was just no way we could figure it out.

53
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We were joking how the only thing we could agree on is the title, military installation.

54
00:03:42.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But the detail was was just it was just too much for us to go along with well to me this is um really important to me so i'm not willing to sign off on um even the underlying on even the underlying bill.

55
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So you don't care about the beverage manufacturers and all the people who are actually doing business in the state.

56
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.500
We have taken care of a lot of the beverage manufacturers and the bills that we passed this year and in the past.

57
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:34.500
But this is really important to me and to me it's an important part of the national security.

58
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500
So no.

59
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500
Okay.

60
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.500
So we're just...

61
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500
so So, Mr.

62
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500
President.

63
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500
Okay.

64
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.500
So, she refused to sign off.

65
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.500
So, even if we go forward, she's not going to sign off.

66
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.500
I think it's unfortunate.

67
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:07.000
We've seen so many examples of that air base in North Dakota, which I know that it was stopped.

68
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:33.500
But one of the most sensitive military installations in the country okay we're the portsmouth naval shipyard we have you know the facility and i i think it's in goffstown um this is a pretty narrow bill 10 miles around those facilities no that would have been fine if that's what it said.

69
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.000
But that's what it said.

70
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.500
No, it doesn't say that.

71
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.000
It says electric line, poles.

72
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
It says everything.

73
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It is the biggest.

74
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Pull it out.

75
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Look at it.

76
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's the biggest laundry list you can imagine.

77
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:06.500
Remember, I asked you if you didn't agree with the language that was in that bill to come back to us with suggestions that we could entertain.

78
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500
And here we are.

79
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:32.500
If you want to say, I guess, is that will, will everything that you cannot sell to anybody who's from, for the people's Republic of China, which I can't even imagine they would have the gall to try to come and buy land in, I guess, near Pease.

80
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.000
They sent a balloon right down the middle of this country.

81
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.500
Don't tell me about gall.

82
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.000
That was in the air.

83
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
That was in the air, right?

84
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
What?

85
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.500
It was over the continental United States.

86
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.500
Right.

87
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.500
They have row houses in Maine.

88
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.500
Let me understand here.

89
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:15.000
You're more worried about this esoteric event that somebody – I just can't even begin to imagine where they're going to buy, whether it's in New Boston or whether you're saying in Pease.

90
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.500
Of course, if there were Pease or the naval base, which is actually in Maine.

91
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.500
Okay.

92
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:32.000
So how are we going to, you know, I mean, did Maine pass this legislation?

93
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Okay.

94
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
How are we going to, how would you word it?

95
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.500
You're going to say that nobody can sell land to the People's Republic of China in Portsmouth.

96
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.500
It's not just sell.

97
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.500
It's lease.

98
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.000
Is that what you want to say?

99
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Or lease, yeah.

100
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.500
No one can lease, buy in Portsmouth in Newington.

101
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:08.000
And then you have to clarify that, and we don't mean vacation rentals.

102
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000
What you're saying is you can't, nobody of Chinese, it's not even Chinese, because we've had this discussion.

103
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It was about Chinese.

104
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.500
The Chinese Communist Party, it is not Chinese nationals.

105
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.000
That is not the words that's in the bill.

106
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
That is the statement from the AG's office.

107
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.500
It's not what it says.

108
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.500
And I sent the language to you a month ago.

109
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:51.000
Let me ask you, do you really believe that there would be a purchase and sale agreement which will say CCCP on it?

110
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:03.500
I'd like to ask you if you really believed that the balloon that flew over the continental United States actually flew over the United States.

111
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.000
No, I know it flew over the United States.

112
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And I also know that we found it in the water and we pulled it up and it didn't have anything, didn't do anything.

113
00:09:20.000 --> 00:10:06.500
If you look at the drugs pouring across this border that have fentanyl, origins in China, if you look at TikTok, if you look at 20,000 or more military-aged Chinese males infiltrating our country, if you look at all of these things and the possibility of an attack on taiwan because they manufacture 90 percent of the chips in this bill why wouldn't you use common sense and pass a bill that has mild restrictions in it and if they're not good enough for you please give us a no it was your...

114
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.500
Give us an alternative.

115
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.000
No, there is no alternative.

116
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.500
It doesn't make any sense.

117
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.000
It makes absolutely no sense.

118
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And if you really believe that our beverage manufacturers, we've done too much for them already, and that you said...

119
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I did not say we've done too much for them.

120
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I said we've done a lot for them.

121
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Okay.

122
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
All right.

123
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.500
A lot versus too much.

124
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.500
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:53.500
And as far as I'm concerned, national security to me means more right now based on what's going on overseas.

126
00:10:53.500 --> 00:11:00.000
If you want to drop it to military installations, our National Guard, fine.

127
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Give me some language.

128
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
No, we're not interested in trying to solve that problem.

129
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.500
If you want to do to solve that problem, put in a bill next year.

130
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:20.000
I'm pretty sure that nothing's going to happen over the summer.

131
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.500
Put the bill in again, rewrite it, do it, start again.

132
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.000
But I'm saying we had a bill on the House side.

133
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
We interim studied it.

134
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
We didn't pass it.

135
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
We have a – as a matter of fact, we interim studied.

136
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.500
We have a study committee already on this issue.

137
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.000
We will absolutely be working on this come September.

138
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.500
The Commerce Committee will be working on this issue come September.

139
00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:19.500
Is that not good enough is that good enough what what is the study committee did did study i mean this we know we we interim studied it that's what we did the the the original bill that was put in by the house Do we have that?

140
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.500
That's typically a polite way of killing it.

141
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.500
Not in commerce.

142
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:41.500
We had an agreement that any bill that was going to be a 10-10 partisan vote, that we would not pass it, that we would work on it to find some consensus.

143
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.500
It wasn't 10-10.

144
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.000
This bill, that bill in our committee.

145
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It's an interim study.

146
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
1183.

147
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And it was unanimous to interim study it.

148
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
What was the vote?

149
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Unit 20-0.

150
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.500
22-0 to interim study it.

151
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.500
Which is really to us it's a polite way of killing it.

152
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.500
That may be true.

153
00:13:09.500 --> 00:14:45.000
That's the way you guys feel about the second year of the session because you're all campaigning, you know, and, but we're, come September, some of us will not be campaigning, and we, we will do it, and I give my commitment to you that we will try to find some way we could pass this with narrow enough language that we feel comfortable with, but your, your version was was it was like every line was like it was it was too broad too wide and it wasn't focused and we will certainly I will commit my commitment to you is that we will we will do a serious study we'll let you know when we're having these meetings we can have the AG's office contribute and we certainly can have the that's who helped me draft draft it but if you want to change this to a study committee we already have a study committee I know a second study committee no just so I know that it's going to be studied I guarantee you I guarantee you, I guarantee you, we'll absolutely have a work session on 13...

154
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
1183.

155
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:56.500
1183, which is relative to prohibiting the sale of agricultural land and land essential to critical industries to China.

156
00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.000
What was the bill that were told?

157
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
1183.

158
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.500
That was a House bill?

159
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.500
Yes, it was.

160
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.000
And I think it was the chairman who sponsored the bill.

161
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Gorski.

162
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Yeah.

163
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Representative Gorski sponsored it.

164
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.500
So, yes, I'm not going to another fellow chairman.

165
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.500
I'm not going to squash his.

166
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500
Can we recess?

167
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:37.500
I promise you we will work on this and we'll try to find some language that we can live with.

168
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.500
All right.

169
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.000
Let me have a conversation.

170
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Thank you.

171
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Thank you.

172
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Thank you.

173
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Thank you.

174
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Yes, our thoughts.

175
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.500
I will offer to do an amendment creating a study committee because I want senators on that as well.

176
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:09.000
So I'll create a study committee to study the China issue with senators on it.

177
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And the only other thing we would tell you, by the way, if you do do it, make sure that you then add in an effective date for that study committee to be upon passage and the report being the end of the year.

178
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Typically November 1st, right?

179
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Because right now it says section 11, which was this part of the bill, which starts January 1, which obviously we're going to move.

180
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Turn that into a study committee.

181
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
The rest of the acts will take effect 60 days after passage.

182
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.500
So you're going to want your study committee to kick in sooner rather than later.

183
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.500
So that's the only thing I would say.

184
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.500
But that's fine.

185
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.000
If that's what you want, a chapter study committee.

186
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.500
Deadline's today at 4, right?

187
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.000
The deadline's today at 4.

188
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Okay, so we...

189
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I'll get it done.

190
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:30.500
You know, if you want us to come back, how much time are we going to need for this?

191
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.500
Get this.

192
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500
I had no idea.

193
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.500
We're...

194
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.500
Right now we have 11 and...

195
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.000
11 I have cannabis, so I would say I have 12.

196
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Yeah, we're on 12, but that's going to be quick.

197
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.500
So that should be quick.

198
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.000
So we can do it right after 12, 12.

199
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
12.30?

200
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
12.30?

201
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Yeah.

202
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Okay.

203
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
All right.

204
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I'll see if they can get it done.

205
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
This is House Bill HB 1358.

206
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Do you want to limit it just to land purchases, or do you want to broaden any kind of influence from the CCP in other areas?

207
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I think I'm – Let her write it.

208
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.500
I'm just – We're okay with whatever chapter study you want to come up with.

209
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:49.500
I want to study the military installations, the National Guard, because they're in a different category, as well as the agricultural piece.

210
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.000
Because I do have concerns about the agricultural piece.

211
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:06.500
If I can ask, the federal government says that right now, if you're within 100 miles of a military base, you have to ask permission.

212
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.500
See, anybody from China has to ask permission.

213
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:18.000
If they grant permission, are we going to try to supersede them and say no?

214
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.500
That doesn't matter what the feds say.

215
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.500
That's something that we can study.

216
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.500
What the effect on the federal law versus state law.

217
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.500
Okay.

218
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.500
Okay.

219
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.500
All right.

220
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:42.500
So we will end this hearing and bring it back to this community conference.

221
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.500
We'll take it back up at 1230 today.

222
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.500
I assume here.

223
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.500
Yeah, we'll say 201.

224
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.500
What room?

225
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.000
Right now, where we are.

226
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
In 201?

227
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Yeah.

228
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
All right, thank you.

229
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Thank you.

230
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Thank you.

231
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Thank you.

232
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Thank you.

233
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Thank you.

234
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Thank you.

235
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Thank you.

236
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Thank you.

237
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Thank you.

238
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Thank you.

239
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Thank you.

240
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Thank you.

241
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Thank you.

242
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Thank you.

243
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Thank you.

244
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Thank you.

245
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Thank you.

246
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Thank you.

247
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Thank you.

248
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Thank you.

249
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Thank you.

250
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Thank you.

251
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Thank you.

252
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Thank you.

253
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Thank you.

254
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Thank you.

255
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Thank you.

256
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Thank you.

257
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Thank you.

258
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Thank you.

259
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Thank you.

260
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Thank you.

261
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Thank you.

262
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Thank you.

263
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Thank you.

264
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Thank you.

265
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Thank you.

266
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Thank you.

267
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Thank you.

268
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Thank you.

269
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Thank you.

270
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Thank you.

271
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Thank you.

272
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Thank you.

273
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Thank you.

274
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Thank you.

275
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Thank you.

276
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Thank you.

277
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Thank you.

278
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Thank you.

279
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Thank you.

280
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Thank you.

281
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Thank you.

282
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Thank you.

283
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Thank you.

284
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Thank you.

285
00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:03.500
Okay, I think the way we left it was that you were going to contemplate some of the things we proposed.

286
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.500
So where are we?

287
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.500
Thank you, Mr.

288
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.500
Chair.

289
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:29.500
So I'm going to make some recommendations, and I'm going to ask that we then take a break until one o'clock to have you guys consider what we're going to be proposing to you and come back at one o'clock.

290
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.500
OK.

291
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:39.500
So the request is that the House secede to the Senate position with the following changes.

292
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:51.500
From Jason Osborne's amendment, Amendment 222H, we agree to add the House ask of provisions on line one through four, which was the passenger.

293
00:22:51.500 --> 00:23:03.000
We would agree to the House ask of provisions six through 10, which has to do with the ATCs and priority in licensure.

294
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.500
We would agree with the House ask with the following changes on the decrim language.

295
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:19.000
We would agree to increase that to one ounce instead of the three quarters of an ounce.

296
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:45.000
To the two new asks that the House gave, we would agree to one new member of the Cannabis Control Commission by increasing under that section 318F22, Roman numeral 2, which is the Cannabis Control Commission, letter I, that increases from one to two of the representatives on the Cannabis Control Commission.

297
00:23:45.000 --> 00:24:03.500
And lastly, based on the date, based on the original Senate amendment for moving from the not-for-profit to for-profit structure, and the problem being that we set a date in there that is before the effective date.

298
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:10.000
They had to have it done before we even made the law effective.

299
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:25.000
So we would agree to sections 9 through 23 that are the sections all dealing with the process of moving from not-for-profit to for-profit and all the language changes necessary.

300
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.500
We would agree to make that effective upon passage.

301
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.500
Upon passage.

302
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:37.500
And I'd ask now that we take a recess until 1 o'clock.

303
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.500
Do we need to?

304
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.500
Yes.

305
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.500
Yes.

306
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.500
Simple statement.

307
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.000
You got something more you want to give us?

308
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Yes.

309
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Yes.

310
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Simple statement.

311
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
You got something more you want to mic give us?

312
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Yes.

313
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Okay.

314
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Just stop there.

315
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
We'll see you.

316
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
We'll see you.

317
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Wait a minute.

318
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Wait a minute.

319
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.500
Did I schedule something for one already?

320
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.500
No.

321
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.500
One o'clock is fine.

322
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.500
Back here.

323
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.500
Right back here.

324
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.000
Can we find it full of room?

325
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I'm all set.

326
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
We're going out on the grass.

327
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
I'm just not sure how we get the YouTube stream over there.

328
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Okay.

329
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
One o'clock on 13, 16, 33.

330
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Okay.

331
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Okay.

332
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Thank you.

333
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Thank you.

334
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Thank you.

335
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Thank you.

336
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Thank you.

337
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Thank you.

338
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Thank you.

339
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Thank you.

340
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Thank you.

341
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Thank you.

342
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Thank you.

343
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Thank you.

344
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Thank you.

345
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000

Thank you.

446
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Thank you.

447
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.500
the committee conference on 1633.

448
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.000
So you actually can remember a bill.

449
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
So Mr.

450
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.500
Chair, I do need to make one minor change to the offer that I made earlier today.

451
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.500
It's not, it's, it's a correction.

452
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.500
That's all.

453
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:16.500
So when I gave you the last conversation about the for profit, the not-for-profit the for-profits i said sections 19 through 23 it should have been section 16 through 23.

454
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:40.500
okay so um who's taking good notes on all these i don't even have my my researcher here so i i guess we need to take something over to legislative services but do we have i How are we going to make sure we have all of it?

455
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.000
Well, I'm just thinking everything through here.

456
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.500
So can you, are your notes good enough that we could?

457
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.500
So I wrote out what the deal was.

458
00:30:53.500 --> 00:31:00.000
As long as the committee of conference report reflects these, you'll get signatures.

459
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Yep.

460
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Okay.

461
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:31.500
So just so just to make sure for everybody yeah why don't you read it to it so the pending motion now is the house will accede to the senate amendment with the following amendment correct with the following changes so um on uh using i'm going to use two documents as our reference point.

462
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:46.000
I'm going to be using Representative Osborne's Amendment 2224H as I'm talking about some things, and I'm talking the original bill or the bill as amended by the Senate.

463
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.500
So those are the two documents I'm working from.

464
00:31:50.500 --> 00:32:02.500
So relative to Amendment 2224H, we will agree to lines 1 through 4 be added to the bill or just merged into the bill.

465
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:08.000
We'll agree to lines 6 through 10 merged into the bill.

466
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Starting on line 22, the temporary language, we will agree to the language but limit it to one ounce, not the two ounces that were in the amendment.

467
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:33.000
We will agree based on the original bill in Section 318-F22, Roman numeral 2, which is the Cannabis Control Commission makeup provision.

468
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:46.000
We will agree to add one more member under Section I, which is representatives of the cannabis industry, to increase the number of people on there.

469
00:32:46.000 --> 00:33:02.000
And lastly, we'll agree to the sections dealing with the not-for-profit to for-profit conversion process in the Senate, in the original amended Senate bill, Section 16 through 23, which are on page...

470
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
I think it's 19.

471
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
It's actually 16.

472
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
16.

473
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
I don't think.

474
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
We verified.

475
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.500
16 through 23 which are on page i think it's 19.

476
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:26.000
it's actually 69 we verified 16 through 23 starting on page 31 and ending on page 34.

477
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:38.500
so we'll agree to bring that forward as upon passage those provisions all right any discussion um of the uh motion just make a comment?

478
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.500
Certainly.

479
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.500
Yeah.

480
00:33:42.500 --> 00:34:10.500
I just want to say while we're going to accede to the suggestions made by the Senate, I do want to be clear that I personally am not, I'm signing this with a lot of angst and a lot of deliberation on my part, and I think some of my colleagues will feel the same way.

481
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:47.500
But however, I think that it's time that we legalize cannabis, and I think some of my colleagues will feel the same way but however I think that it's time that we um that we legalize cannabis and I think that this is the right move anybody else okay all those in favor say aye aye all those opposed so move you're gonna vote against it but but I am going to sign one.

482
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.500
Yes.

483
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.500
There you go.

484
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.000
The key element is he's signing it.

485
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Yes.

486
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
For today.

487
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
For today.

488
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
So, okay.

489
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Thank you.

490
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Done deal.

491
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.500
So, okay, so Senator L Lang, do I need a copy of that?

492
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.500
Or.

493
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.500
Thank you.

494
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.500
Thank you.

495
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.500
Thank you.

496
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.500
Thank you.

497
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.500
Thank you.

498
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:31.000
so 12 30 so all right so So we're doing 1350A.

499
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.500
So the House will see to the Senate position.

500
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:52.500
Just listen with the deletion of the amendment of the section of the bill related to military installations and then replace that section will be replaced with a, so that must be section 10.

501
00:35:52.500 --> 00:36:04.000
That will be replaced with the study committee in section 10 and section 11 has a new, probably has a new effective date.

502
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:13.500
Yeah, just make sure the effective dates are right because it's 25, Section 10 of this act will shake.

503
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:26.000
Upon a passage, the study committee takes place on passage, and then the rest of the act will take place in 60 days after passage.

504
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:37.500
And that includes, just so everybody understands, that includes the relative to tenant and contract manufacturers, allows pharmacists to administer influenza and COVID-19.

505
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.500
So we might listen.

506
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.000
That's been passed somewhere else.

507
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
That was passed.

508
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Yeah, you'll know what I'm saying.

509
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:55.000
It's because you want to talk to a representative for itself because I think that was.

510
00:36:55.000 --> 00:38:28.500
The pharmacists administering influenza and COVID-19 and other FDAda we divided oh we were just talking about divided the question on the floor in the senate and pulled it out because you guys passed forward that's right that was never in this that was never in here that's correct okay so then and then but it does include now a study committee for the military installation so it is just the tenant and contract manufacturers and it also has the study committee and can you put on the record that i will not be appointed to that take that up with the speaker do either do you want me to copy you on the request for that So when you put it in, they do it it and then as soon as it's done we get emailed it right oh i know i know i know but just yes no i think no i'm gonna be yeah that's fine no that's fine okay join the club oh wait i should be don't feel like don't feel like yelling at her see see Oh, wait, I should be.

511
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.500
Don't feel not yelling at her.

512
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.500
See?

513
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.500
See?

514
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.500
No, wait a minute.

515
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.000
This is called an acceding.

516
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.500
The House is acceding to the Senate?

517
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.500
It doesn't have to, I guess.

518
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.500
It's true that it could be.

519
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.500
It's your bill.

520
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:58.000
So the Senate could be acceding to the House position with an amendment.

521
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
That's true.

522
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.500
Let's do it that way.

523
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.500
All right.

524
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:12.500
Yeah, the Senate is acceding to the House position with the amendment of the study committee.

525
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.500
China.

526
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.500
China.

527
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.500
China.

528
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.000
I will be in Paris.

529
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Seriously, I will be in Paris in August.

530
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Oh, and I'll be in Ireland.

531
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
There you go.

532
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
We'll have a meeting in Europe.

533
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
That's okay.

534
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Your chapter study.

535
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
When are you going to have your meeting?

536
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Who's going to be the first?

537
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
So the first person is going to have to be...

538
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
I'll be gone in two weeks.

539
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Okay.

540
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
We're all in agreement?

541
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Yeah.

542
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
All right.

543
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
All those in favor say weeks.

544
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Okay.

545
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
We're all in agreement?

546
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Yeah.

547
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
All right.

548
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
All those in favor say aye.

549
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Aye.

550
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Those opposed.

551
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Thank you.
