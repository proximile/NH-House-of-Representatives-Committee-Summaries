00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
droplets um and I didn't know that the

00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
reason doctors or surgeons wear masks is
 

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:29.750 align:start position:0%
reason doctors or surgeons wear masks is
because<00:30:28.240><c> of</c><00:30:28.440><c> droplets</c><00:30:29.159><c> and</c><00:30:29.360><c> that's</c><00:30:29.559><c> why</c>

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
because of droplets and that's why
 

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.630 align:start position:0%
because of droplets and that's why
they've<00:30:30.039><c> always</c><00:30:30.360><c> worn</c><00:30:30.919><c> them</c><00:30:31.919><c> um</c><00:30:32.159><c> I</c><00:30:32.279><c> didn't</c>

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
they've always worn them um I didn't
 

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.269 align:start position:0%
they've always worn them um I didn't

00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
know that on an n95 mass that you had to
 

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:39.789 align:start position:0%

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
we learned that but I think we learned
 

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.750 align:start position:0%
we learned that but I think we learned

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
El elderly uh and I think New Hampshire
did<00:44:04.839><c> that</c><00:44:05.119><c> pretty</c><00:44:05.400><c> well</c><00:44:05.760><c> I</c><00:44:05.839><c> mean</c><00:44:06.160><c> we</c><00:44:06.680><c> that</c><00:44:06.800><c> was</c>

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
did that pretty well I mean we that was
 

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.549 align:start position:0%
did that pretty well I mean we that was

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
um but we also know that um the younger
 

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.470 align:start position:0%
um but we also know that um the younger
people<00:44:19.880><c> aren't</c><00:44:20.319><c> as</c><00:44:20.760><c> affected</c><00:44:21.680><c> uh</c><00:44:21.839><c> by</c><00:44:22.079><c> this</c><00:44:22.280><c> and</c>

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
people aren't as affected uh by this and
 

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.589 align:start position:0%
people aren't as affected uh by this and
really<00:44:22.720><c> weren't</c><00:44:23.200><c> catching</c><00:44:23.520><c> it</c><00:44:23.720><c> or</c><00:44:24.319><c> even</c>

00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
really weren't catching it or even
 

00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:28.230 align:start position:0%
really weren't catching it or even
transmitting<00:44:25.280><c> it</c><00:44:25.599><c> is</c><00:44:25.920><c> my</c><00:44:26.520><c> understanding</c>

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
transmitting it is my understanding
 

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.950 align:start position:0%
transmitting it is my understanding
so<00:44:28.960><c> and</c><00:44:29.200><c> we</c><00:44:29.359><c> know</c><00:44:29.720><c> that</c><00:44:30.160><c> the</c><00:44:30.280><c> next</c><00:44:30.520><c> one</c><00:44:30.720><c> coming</c>

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
so and we know that the next one coming
 

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.750 align:start position:0%
so and we know that the next one coming
down<00:44:31.160><c> the</c><00:44:31.359><c> pike</c><00:44:31.680><c> could</c><00:44:31.920><c> affect</c><00:44:32.200><c> a</c><00:44:32.359><c> different</c>

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
down the pike could affect a different
 

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.150 align:start position:0%
down the pike could affect a different

it<00:44:35.319><c> will</c><00:44:35.880><c> affect</c><00:44:36.880><c> but</c><00:44:37.160><c> I</c><00:44:37.319><c> think</c><00:44:37.640><c> in</c><00:44:38.040><c> in</c><00:44:39.000><c> when</c><00:44:39.280><c> we</c>

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
it will affect but I think in in when we
 

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.549 align:start position:0%
it will affect but I think in in when we

00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
give out our guidance we need to be
 

00:44:41.559 --> 00:44:43.950 align:start position:0%

um one regarding Hospital visitation I
 

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.870 align:start position:0%
um one regarding Hospital visitation I
would<00:45:07.040><c> think</c><00:45:07.559><c> that</c><00:45:08.440><c> whatever</c><00:45:08.920><c> the</c><00:45:09.280><c> hospital</c>

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
would think that whatever the hospital
 

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.150 align:start position:0%
would think that whatever the hospital
was<00:45:10.119><c> using</c><00:45:10.960><c> to</c><00:45:11.240><c> attend</c><00:45:11.720><c> to</c><00:45:12.040><c> that</c>

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
was using to attend to that
 

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.950 align:start position:0%
was using to attend to that
patient<00:45:14.160><c> their</c><00:45:14.559><c> family</c><00:45:15.040><c> should</c><00:45:15.280><c> be</c><00:45:15.440><c> able</c><00:45:15.720><c> to</c>

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
patient their family should be able to
 

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
patient their family should be able to
use<00:45:16.920><c> and</c><00:45:17.079><c> in</c><00:45:17.720><c> sometimes</c><00:45:18.400><c> that</c><00:45:18.640><c> might</c><00:45:18.960><c> just</c><00:45:19.240><c> be</c>

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
use and in sometimes that might just be
 

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.510 align:start position:0%
use and in sometimes that might just be
looking<00:45:19.880><c> through</c><00:45:20.119><c> a</c><00:45:20.599><c> window</c><00:45:21.599><c> but</c><00:45:22.160><c> sometimes</c>

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
looking through a window but sometimes
 

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.750 align:start position:0%
looking through a window but sometimes
that<00:45:22.720><c> might</c><00:45:22.960><c> be</c><00:45:23.160><c> a</c><00:45:23.400><c> full</c><00:45:24.400><c> get</c><00:45:24.640><c> up</c><00:45:24.960><c> or</c><00:45:25.400><c> or</c>

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
that might be a full get up or or
 

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.589 align:start position:0%
that might be a full get up or or
whatever<00:45:26.760><c> um</c>

00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
whatever um
 

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:30.510 align:start position:0%
whatever um
so<00:45:27.920><c> I</c><00:45:28.079><c> think</c><00:45:28.440><c> that</c><00:45:28.880><c> would</c><00:45:29.880><c> we</c><00:45:30.000><c> wouldn't</c><00:45:30.400><c> have</c>

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that would we wouldn't have

01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.030 align:start position:0%
recommended uh so it's kind of the
removed<01:33:40.520><c> from</c><01:33:40.800><c> Swiss</c><01:33:41.159><c> cheese</c><01:33:41.760><c> approach</c><01:33:42.760><c> and</c>

removed from Swiss cheese approach and
 

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.430 align:start position:0%

01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
then they were kind of they were
 

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.709 align:start position:0%
then they were kind of they were

01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
like wait for federal government to
 

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.830 align:start position:0%

01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
antibodies for covid treatment so it's
 

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.910 align:start position:0%
antibodies for covid treatment so it's
again<01:34:05.719><c> it</c><01:34:05.880><c> was</c><01:34:06.280><c> like</c><01:34:06.760><c> kind</c><01:34:06.960><c> of</c><01:34:07.239><c> very</c><01:34:07.560><c> limited</c>

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
again it was like kind of very limited
 

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.109 align:start position:0%
again it was like kind of very limited
so<01:34:10.920><c> so</c><01:34:11.199><c> represent</c><01:34:11.719><c> P</c><01:34:12.159><c> what</c><01:34:12.280><c> you're</c><01:34:12.400><c> saying</c><01:34:12.800><c> is</c>

01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
so so represent P what you're saying is
 

01:34:13.119 --> 01:34:15.750 align:start position:0%
so so represent P what you're saying is
that<01:34:13.760><c> although</c><01:34:14.159><c> the</c><01:34:14.440><c> Swiss</c><01:34:14.840><c> cheese</c><01:34:15.320><c> approach</c>

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
that although the Swiss cheese approach
 

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
that although the Swiss cheese approach
was

01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
was
 

01:34:16.639 --> 01:34:18.590 align:start position:0%
was

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.830 align:start position:0%

01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
prevention there was that was opposite
 

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.030 align:start position:0%
prevention there was that was opposite
of<01:34:26.119><c> what</c><01:34:26.280><c> was</c><01:34:27.239><c> applied</c><01:34:27.639><c> for</c><01:34:27.880><c> treatment</c><01:34:28.840><c> is</c>

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
of what was applied for treatment is
 

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.350 align:start position:0%
of what was applied for treatment is
that

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
that
 

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.669 align:start position:0%
that
correct<01:34:31.360><c> more</c><01:34:31.719><c> like</c><01:34:32.239><c> it's</c><01:34:32.560><c> was</c><01:34:32.760><c> more</c>

01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
correct more like it's was more
 

01:34:33.679 --> 01:34:36.910 align:start position:0%
correct more like it's was more
nuanced<01:34:34.679><c> situation</c><01:34:35.320><c> than</c><01:34:35.679><c> just</c><01:34:36.040><c> Swiss</c><01:34:36.520><c> ch's</c>

01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
nuanced situation than just Swiss ch's
 

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.790 align:start position:0%
nuanced situation than just Swiss ch's
approach<01:34:37.920><c> so</c><01:34:38.920><c> yeah</c><01:34:39.199><c> I</c><01:34:39.400><c> tried</c><01:34:39.880><c> to</c><01:34:40.880><c> use</c><01:34:41.400><c> many</c>

01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
approach so yeah I tried to use many
 

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.790 align:start position:0%
approach so yeah I tried to use many
measures<01:34:42.360><c> both</c><01:34:42.560><c> for</c><01:34:42.840><c> prevention</c><01:34:43.440><c> and</c><01:34:43.600><c> for</c>

01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
measures both for prevention and for
 

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.189 align:start position:0%
measures both for prevention and for
treatment<01:34:44.440><c> but</c><01:34:44.960><c> then</c><01:34:45.960><c> quite</c><01:34:46.199><c> a</c><01:34:46.400><c> few</c><01:34:46.679><c> measures</c>

01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
treatment but then quite a few measures
 

01:34:47.199 --> 01:34:51.030 align:start position:0%
treatment but then quite a few measures
that<01:34:47.480><c> should</c><01:34:47.960><c> have</c><01:34:48.159><c> been</c><01:34:48.440><c> used</c><01:34:49.239><c> were</c><01:34:49.520><c> not</c><01:34:50.040><c> used</c>

01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
that should have been used were not used
 

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.350 align:start position:0%
that should have been used were not used
so<01:34:51.320><c> it's</c><01:34:51.840><c> it</c><01:34:52.159><c> I</c><01:34:52.560><c> I</c><01:34:52.679><c> see</c><01:34:52.960><c> it</c><01:34:53.159><c> as</c><01:34:53.360><c> more</c><01:34:53.800><c> complex</c>

01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it I I see it as more complex
 

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.669 align:start position:0%
so it's it I I see it as more complex
than<01:34:54.800><c> just</c><01:34:55.280><c> uh</c><01:34:55.639><c> applying</c><01:34:56.119><c> every</c><01:34:56.679><c> possible</c>

measure that is
 

01:35:00.119 --> 01:35:03.229 align:start position:0%

01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
I mean if if there's a problem at that
 

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.910 align:start position:0%
I mean if if there's a problem at that
deepest<01:50:08.760><c> level</c><01:50:09.080><c> that</c><01:50:09.199><c> would</c><01:50:09.360><c> taint</c>

everything all the way down the line so
 

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.390 align:start position:0%
everything all the way down the line so
I'd<01:50:11.880><c> like</c><01:50:12.040><c> to</c><01:50:12.119><c> know</c><01:50:12.280><c> more</c><01:50:12.480><c> about</c>

01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know more about
 

01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:15.950 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know more about
that<01:50:14.400><c> uh</c><01:50:14.599><c> and</c><01:50:14.800><c> I'm</c><01:50:14.960><c> just</c><01:50:15.080><c> going</c><01:50:15.199><c> to</c><01:50:15.639><c> be</c><01:50:15.840><c> a</c>

01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
that uh and I'm just going to be a
 

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
that uh and I'm just going to be a
little<01:50:16.239><c> adversarial</c><01:50:17.119><c> here</c><01:50:17.599><c> I</c>

01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
little adversarial here I
 

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:21.109 align:start position:0%
little adversarial here I
mean<01:50:19.480><c> there's</c><01:50:19.880><c> bias</c><01:50:20.280><c> in</c>

01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
mean there's bias in
 

01:50:21.119 --> 01:50:26.510 align:start position:0%
mean there's bias in
everything<01:50:22.119><c> um</c><01:50:23.119><c> so</c><01:50:23.639><c> I</c><01:50:23.800><c> guess</c><01:50:24.159><c> the</c><01:50:24.360><c> question</c><01:50:24.760><c> is</c>

01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
everything um so I guess the question is
 

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:30.310 align:start position:0%
everything um so I guess the question is
is<01:50:27.800><c> um</c><01:50:28.800><c> I'm</c><01:50:28.920><c> a</c><01:50:29.080><c> numbers</c><01:50:29.520><c> person</c><01:50:29.840><c> it's</c><01:50:30.040><c> kind</c><01:50:30.159><c> of</c>

01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
is um I'm a numbers person it's kind of
 

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.990 align:start position:0%
is um I'm a numbers person it's kind of
black<01:50:30.560><c> and</c><01:50:30.800><c> white</c><01:50:31.040><c> they</c><01:50:31.159><c> either</c><01:50:31.400><c> say</c><01:50:31.679><c> this</c><01:50:31.800><c> or</c>

01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
black and white they either say this or
 

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.669 align:start position:0%

01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
they say that you really can't
 

01:50:33.679 --> 01:50:36.750 align:start position:0%
they say that you really can't
