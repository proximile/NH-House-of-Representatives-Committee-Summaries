morning
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
everyone so I I think we've learned a
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
good number of things so far and one of
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
the things though I would like to take a
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
little time today to do um is to
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
supplement our mission statement in this
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
committee which identifies sort of the
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to accomplish in the
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
scope of what we're investigating and
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
looking at with a bit of a jaunt through
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution to help
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
us identify our
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
purview our capabilities and what
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
actually could be done conceivably not
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
that we'll take every measure but could
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
be done um as a part of that uh
 
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
representative beler when you say
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
supplement our mission statement um our
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
mission statement is is pretty clear but
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
can you expand on what you mean by that
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
yes uh perhaps it wasn't the best choice
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
of words what I mean by is our mission
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
Sten outlines the the items to be looked
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
at and investigated what the the scope
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
of our committee is looking at um but
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
everything we do within that scope is
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
done according to the New Hampshire
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution so I think it would be good
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
idea to also look at the New Hampshire
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution to say okay within the
 
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
scope of our mission statement what
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
capacities do we have as a committee
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
what remedies might we offer um
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh as a part of this
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
committee does the committee have any
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so just looking to
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
the uh State of New Hampshire
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution I've got it all pulled up
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
here on my computer we can go through
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
each section that is pertinent to what
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing um shouldn't take too long
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
to do but I think it's good to look at
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
um let's see we have under state
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
constitution form of
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
government we have article
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
four the power of the general Court to
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
establish courts um it is within the
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
purview of this body this legislative
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
body to establish courts of record to uh
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
handle any issues that need to be
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in this state um and again
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not suggesting that we will
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
for the audience take every measure I'm
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
look we're just simply going through the
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution saying this is what we have
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
as a legislative body so we could
 
00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
eventually if if we wanted to recommend
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
the creation of the establishment of of
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
a court of record to deal with any
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
issues relating to what we might find um
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
we have the power of legislation we can
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh well under house rules as they
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
currently exist we can't issue
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
legislation without a suspension of the
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
rules but we can certainly make
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations for
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
legislation going
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
forward um to be introduced at a later
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
time we have the we have the power of
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
taxation I don't think we need to look
 
00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:02.759 align:start position:0%
too close to that one in this committee
 
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.150 align:start position:0%
too close to that one in this committee
right

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.900 align:start position:0%
right
now

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:05.910 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.389 align:start position:0%
now
[Laughter]

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh let's see as far as um we have the
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the powers and also the duty to
 
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.430 align:start position:0%
the uh the powers and also the duty to
address

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
grievances um from members of the public
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
so as we have received or reive in the
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
future grievances that are related to
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
our mission in this committee we can
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
examine them and in investigate them and
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for how to how to
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
move forward with any appropriate
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
redress of
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
grievances um we can find that under the
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
Rights we can let's see
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
here uh I believe under under a reading
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
of article
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
83 we have the capacity to make
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the private sector as
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
well as
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
um institutions of
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
education and otherwise for any needs
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
that we may come across for instance if
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
we were to find that there's a glaring
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
scientific need for Research into a
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
particular item we can make
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations to to the institutions
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
and public sector to to pursue those
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
um so something to the effect of uh
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
recommending uh specific guidelines for
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
air filters to help mitigate viruses
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
would that be one of those items that we
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
could recommend or I'm just trying to
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
understand when you say I believe
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking something like that
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
would be addressed through legislation I
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
this I think is more in terms of if we
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
discovered for instance that there
 
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.350 align:start position:0%
discovered for instance that there
was

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
um some problem that came up as a part
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine roll outs or something to
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
that effect that that that
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
rendered um that rendered us with a with
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
a problem within the broad body politic
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
we could instead of instead of dealing
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
with directly legislation we could say
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
okay we have a bunch of universities in
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
this state they do a lot of research we
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
can appeal to them it's not a mandate we
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
can't make them necessarily do this
 
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
stuff but we can appeal to them to
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
consider investing some funding and time
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
into investigating this particular
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
matter to look for Solutions because
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's just part of their charge under
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
their what they do so similar to people
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
that um switched over to make hand
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
sanitizers um during the pandemic period
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
sure yeah and and there was there was uh
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
I believe executive orders that provided
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
some relief from regulation that allowed
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
them to pursue uh switch overs like that
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and that's something that we could I
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
mean there's nothing stopping us as well
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
from from uh making recommendations to
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the executive branch for um executive
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
orders or ex as well as exercising our
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
oversight of what has occurred um making
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations for future if there is
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
another emerging event or pandemic that
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
comes up um as well as exercising
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight um and also
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
exercising oversight over our state
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
federal relation
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
what kind of funds were received what
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
kind of mandates or you might say
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
strings came with any of those funds and
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
whether there is anything in the future
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done differently um
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
those can be all within our purview I
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
believe comfortably within our
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate as a
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
committee does anyone have any other
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
comments uh relating to what uh
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
represent Bela was just discussing
 
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.430 align:start position:0%
represent Bela was just discussing
represent

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
vus I think it's great spelling out our
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
powers more specifically according to
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
the Constitution thank you
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
welcome is there anything else uh that
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
anyone would like to
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
discuss um regarding our duties or how
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're functioning things that we're
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
doing right um
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
anything further that we need to discuss
 
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.149 align:start position:0%
anything further that we need to discuss
representative

00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
HOV just a s that uh I I had as I was
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
listening uh we mentioned the power of
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
taxation and it's definitely that people
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
are already taxed enough but also um
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
like my thought was uh that one of the
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
problem that we had here and otherwise
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
is that uh people who are injured for
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
example by
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
vaccines are having
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
trouble receiving proper compensation
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
even though uh government established uh
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
St federal government established a
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
special fund for those purposes so I
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
just wonder if if the fund is not enough
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
and that's why people are being uh to
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
around or other other reasons why it's
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
that process is so honorous on on
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
victims uh just a sort so
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
probably because it's
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
already inside the government uh so
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
probably it's not a case of additional
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
taxation that is needed but uh something
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
to think
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
about uh represent
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and I I
 
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
would just add to that uh speaking
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
directly to the audience the general
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
public that what we're doing as a
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee obviously we establish this
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee we asked to establish this
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee we want to move forward with
 
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.870 align:start position:0%
committee we want to move forward with
these

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
investigations but we're doing this
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
primarily based on based on the public
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
based on uh grievances based on
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
petitions um because we've heard we've
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
heard from you and we would like to
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
continue to hear from you um about any
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
items related to our purview within our
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
broad uh investigation of the co
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
efficacy and our state response to covid
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
so for those listening um if you have
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
items that you think were done well or
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%

violation of your rights or anything of

speak also to that guidance um of how it
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
was uh rolled out um and if there are
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
any questions from this committee if we
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
could get those uh specific questions
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
together for him I know representative
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
eel's already uh has some questions that
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
she would like to uh
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
see a you know answered if anyone else
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
here I can send those out to him to give
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
him a heads up um but he was
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
instrumental in
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
issuing the funds uh through the
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
state uh so that everyone knows um
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
earlier in that day if we decide to meet
 
00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:00.039 align:start position:0%
earlier that day um uh that there'll be
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
room for the
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
public um and right now those are the
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
only two dates currently
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled um I'm possibly looking to
 
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
schedule a
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
Tuesday at some point um not sure which
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
Tuesday would work for everybody if
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
Tuesday would work for anybody here um
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
because once we get past this uh through
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
the 16th I believe all house deadlines
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
have had to be met um with regards to
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
bills and then I believe it would just
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
be special hearings um we are still
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get director buckton to commit
 
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
to a date that's why I'm thinking of a
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
Tuesday um and if we can get a specific
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I'm sure that he won't be here a
 
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
full day and we can have the public come
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
in at that time um but if there is
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
anybody that would like to come in and
 
00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:00.070 align:start position:0%
anybody that would like to come in and
speak

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
um and if they could just reach out and
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
then we could schedule meetings uh just
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh to hear from them if we have uh one
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
one person we can put them in with
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else if we have several people
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
we could do a a day just for the public
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh to come and discuss uh what's going
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
on I think um having uh the mom here the
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
last time time we met um was really eye
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
openening as I had said it was um was
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking but it was also
 
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.549 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking but it was also
um

00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
insightful into um the response and how
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
it affected children how it affected
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
Families how it affected uh personal
 
00:25:57.549 --> 00:25:57.559 align:start position:0%
relationships Etc and to touch on
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
know with respect to getting
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursed uh through the government
 
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.190 align:start position:0%
reimbursed uh through the government
funded

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.950 align:start position:0%
funded
site

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
um because of the time
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
frame they were not able to do so I
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
believe is what she had mentioned I
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
would have to double check her
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
testimony but
 
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.510 align:start position:0%
testimony but
[Music]

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
um uh represent
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
of just follow up on on that so that
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's probably not an issue of uh
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
taxation that there's not enough
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
taxation because some other funds were
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
over how to say over permissive and
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
issuing funds we know that many small
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
businesses were receiving compensation
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
for being closed and there was a lot of
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
fraud when some non-existent businesses
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh some fous business names were used to
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
receive those funds and the fraud was
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
so so huge that government doesn't have
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
resources to go after every every case
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
of of that so we see that in some cases
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh like some compensations and other uh
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
Co response related funds were
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
distributed too freely but in some cases
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
I feel like like uh there was too much
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
tension represent
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
leus is one of the speakers who's coming
 
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
on in the 16th or 17th able to answer
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
how those decisions were made so that we
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
make sure if this ever happens again we
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't we have a process that doesn't
 
00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
allow for that fraud I I think that um
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
that would be more of a question for
 
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell on the
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
17th and or director buckon who is also
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
uh with Homeland Security in New
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who handled the federal
 
00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.190 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who handled the federal
funds

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of money flowing
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
through um the state and from the
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
um so I know that um and there were many
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
many people trying to um get their hands
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
on money even if they weren't entitled
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate uh but that is was the way
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
it was and that's just Society I think
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
and we'll always see uh fraud no matter
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
what's going on um there are people that
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
they try really hard at it um as you
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
have we hear about that all the time um
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that would be the
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee um to look
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
into to that um that would just be too
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
owner that would have to be another
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
committee um to look into things like
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
that um because our Focus really needs
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
on the administration of the federal
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
Guidance the acceptance of the federal
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
funds the implementation of the
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization vacc
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
um and um how that affected different
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
areas as we know it affected
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
education it did affect the private and
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
the public sector it affected everybody
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
technically but I think uh for us to
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
really look
 
00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:49.310 align:start position:0%
really look
at

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
um the abuses in the federal
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
funds we just wouldn't be able to do I
 
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
think what is really the focus of this
 
00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.630 align:start position:0%
think what is really the focus of this
committee

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I think um you know we've
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
learned a lot uh so far even though
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
we've only had a few meetings uh we had
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
the industrial hygienist in here uh
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
Steve Petty um and I learned more about
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
masks than I ever thought that I would
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
know I learned about microns and
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
droplets um and I didn't know that the
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
reason doctors or surgeons wear masks is
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
because of droplets and that's why
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
they've always worn them um I didn't
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
know that on an n95 mass that you had to
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
be professionally fitted for that and I
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
thought think that is a really piece of
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
important information and I think that
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
the information that we learned about
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
mask uh should be um one of the things
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
topics in our
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
report because what we did learn is that
 
00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
the covid virus was I forget what the
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
number of the Micron was but no no ma a
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
mass that we had readily available to us
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
could actually prevent
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
that uh stop that mic that virus from
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
being expelled from us or even with the
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
mask on getting into us and I think
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
that's really important to understand
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
and I think in the future or when we're
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to implement policies we
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
need to look at that and say gee is this
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
a virus and if this is
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
microns you know what is the effect uh
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
of that I think that's important uh for
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
the public to understand and so that we
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a false sense of security in
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
my opinion um because of that
 
00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:54.750 align:start position:0%
my opinion um because of that
representative

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you madam chair and just to um
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
follow follow on with what you were just
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
saying I think I think there is a um a
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
trend or a
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
um something that's been ongoing in the
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary at the at the federal level
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
recently which parallels what you were
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
just sort of talking about which is if
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
you'll give me a second to explain the
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
idea of an intermediate versus a strict
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
scrutiny which is used in adjudicating
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
um cases often times uh in the Judiciary
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
with and forgive me these paraphrasing
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
these definitions but the idea being
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
that where constitutional rights are
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
implicated under a uh strict skirtin
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
Paradigm um there is an extraordinarily
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
high level of burden of proof placed on
 
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
the government that it is wholly
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to do this whatever this is um
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
to override that um that individual
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
right versus a more intermediate level
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
of scrutiny which merely suggests that
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
the government only have to prove that
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
it might be useful to do so basically
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
not perfect definitions I don't have
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
them up in front of me but the idea
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
being that perhaps and this is something
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss I'm sure when it comes to
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
issuing a report but perhaps um there
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be some sort of a
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation going forward that
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
anytime individual constitutional rights
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
are implicated we need to be operating
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
more along the lines of a strict
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
scrutiny than an intermediate scrutiny
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
where we really have to have a burden of
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
evidence that is significant on the part
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the government um before we can
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
simply tell people you have to do this
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
this thank you for for that um that's
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
very helpful in um explaining to
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
myself um I'm sure as to others on how
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
things are guided I also think on that
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
lines is what we did learn regarding
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
mask is that the medical profession
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
isn't the one that understands
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
masking they understand
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
medicine um and they're a
 
00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:20.990 align:start position:0%
medicine um and they're a
specialist

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh and that understand how masks work
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
and I think um one of the
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
things that and I'm not sure and we'll
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
get I'm sure we'll find out as we have
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
people in from the state on how they
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
received the federal guidance and did
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
they do their own investigation and did
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
they bring in their own specialist in
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
those areas or did they just take the
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
word uh and said that this is the way it
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
is um because again what we heard from
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
the gentleman that was here was that
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
when all of this was happening he went
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
into a
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
school uh that was uh a special needs
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
school where the masking issue was going
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
to create a serious problem and they
 
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.030 align:start position:0%
to create a serious problem and they
instituted

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
instituted
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
protocols um where they didn't mask at
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
all and they had zero cases of covid um
 
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.349 align:start position:0%
all and they had zero cases of covid um
I

00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
think I didn't even know that there was
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
a whole industry out there that
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
specialized in mask understood the
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
different properties a mask or anything
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
like that and so for me that was
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
extremely enlightening um and I'm sure
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
for most people they would think that
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know your medical profession would
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
would be the ones that would understand
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
that but they receive guidance from
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
these specialist um so I think one of
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
the things that
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
we need to look at and we need to ask
 
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.990 align:start position:0%
we need to look at and we need to ask
going

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
forward is are we bringing in the proper
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
specialist to give us
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
guidance representative Belcher thank
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
you again Madam chair and again I'll
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
follow up a little bit on what we're
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
talking about here because I think
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
there's two completely unrelated very
 
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
important points to pull out of what you
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
were just saying which is um we looked
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
from what we've gathered so far are very
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
myopically a very narrow focus on one
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
set of ideas about how to contain the
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
outbreak of covid we we settled on um
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
primarily masking whereas what we've
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
heard is very few places took a more
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
sensible approach um of environmental
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
controls where an item that would have
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
had minimal impact on anybody's um
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
individual rights or their ability to
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
choose whether or not to wear a mask um
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
was overlooked in so many cases and
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
probably would have resulted in a less
 
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
expensive and higher efficacy weight
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
path forward um so that's something
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
we'll definitely want to take a closer
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
look at and the other item was oh yes uh
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
this is important as well one of the
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
things I'd like to get more information
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
on regarding a lot of these mandates
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
that came up for various places I I
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
wonder to what degree litigiousness
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
played into various decisions um because
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
we do have somewhat of a you know
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
litigious Society at at at the moment
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps not as much as back in the 90s
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
but was there a fear of of
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that drove some of this um what
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
you might call
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
safetyism that drove certain
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
requirements on people to do various
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
things and because this brings up a very
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
important point about what we just went
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
through as far as our constitutional
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
abilities uh again inside article 83 we
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
have the the ability and the duty to
 
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.030 align:start position:0%
have the the ability and the duty to
offer

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
immunities where necessary to protect
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
people's rights so what that might mean
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
is something we could consider
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
recommending if we discover that there
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
was any degree of litigiousness or fear
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
of Suits behind any of these mandates
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
we could consider legislation or
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
something of that effect in the future
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
offering immunity from civil
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
suit um in situations where individual
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
rights would otherwise be
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
overridden with
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
mandates for instance you know hospitals
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
they they wouldn't have to worry about
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
being sued if they don't force people to
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
wear a mask or or be vaccinated for
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
covid or whatever it may be we have the
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
ability to offer these civil immunities
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
that might be able to protect individual
 
00:39:00.319 --> 00:39:02.190 align:start position:0%
that might be able to protect individual
rights

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
better represent beler just a question
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
um regarding that um the
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals instituted a strict uh
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
protocol where no
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
visitations to anybody in a in the
 
00:39:20.319 --> 00:39:21.910 align:start position:0%
visitations to anybody in a in the
hospital

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
um would that be something that you're
 
00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:25.829 align:start position:0%
um would that be something that you're
speaking

00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
to that would be at least adjacent to
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
something that I'm speaking to the idea
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
I I'd have to work it out exactly how
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
that issue might work in this regard but
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
for instance if you were saying a
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
hospital is now being told by some
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
higher entity that they
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
should block people from being able to
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
access patients in the hospital in order
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
to do infection control well now you've
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
got a a should it's not quite a mandate
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
but it's a recommendation coming down
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
from perhaps a federal level or some
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
other organization
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
well in theory if they don't do that and
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
now you have a problem where there's an
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
outbreak or whatever in theory you could
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
have a lawsuit on those grounds saying
 
00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
you failed to follow this guidance so
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
did litigiousness in that kind of an
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
instance Drive these policies they may
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
have I'd like to know more about that
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
but one thing we could do is write
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that says people have these
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
rights to be able to do these certain
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
things perhaps we could say that we
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
believe people have a right to visit
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
their loved ones especially when they're
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
ill they're dying whatever ever and you
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
will be immune from civil suit if you
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
allow this to
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
happen uh not to be um
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
adversarial however uh do you believe uh
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
that there are cases uh of infect highly
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
contagious diseases where people should
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
not be able to go into that section um
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
just thank you and that that is that is
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
a bit of a complicated question because
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
you have you know differentiation
 
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
between something like covid blue versus
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
Ebola so those are those are very very
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
difficult questions to answer but I
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
would always eror on the side of
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
individual freedom and say if somebody
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
has somebody who's sick and dying of a
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
of a very contagious nasty
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
disease if there is any ability
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to fit that person with
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
adequate uh protective controls to
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread of infection then I
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
think they probably ought to be allowed
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
to do so um waving any right to uh a
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
civil suit if they're uh if they were to
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
contract something in order to be there
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
to hold the hand of of a Dying loved one
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
I think even with some of the more
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
severe diseases they think that could be
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate again if they can be
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
outfitted with the proper protective
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
equipment okay okay so as long as they
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
operator can be with uh
 
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
operator can be with uh
PPE

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
PPE
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
um then you're saying it's okay because
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
my concern would be that um in the case
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
of Ebola or something that
 
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
um there was something and they went out
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
and they spread that into the public so
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
I I think um we have to be cautious I
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
understand Co is different than baa um
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's something that we
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
need to look at right I mean we need to
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
um Co is a virus um it's I personally
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
call it the flu on steroids
 
00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:47.190 align:start position:0%
call it the flu on steroids
um

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
um deadly for some people as is the flu
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
as is monia I mean we have all kinds
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
of uh viral and bacterial uh infections
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
that are deadly to certain parts of the
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
population depending on age depending on
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
um you know complications and different
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
health issues um and the other thing
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
that I think we learned is that from Co
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
from um I believe it was Dr kof that t
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
talk to us
 
00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:31.270 align:start position:0%
talk to us
is

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
that based on what we know we know the
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
population that was most
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
affected and we know the
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
population and I'm not sure how quickly
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
we learned that but I think we learned
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly who wasn't getting covid
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
and who was um and I think that's
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
something that we really need to in the
 
00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:54.630 align:start position:0%
something that we really need to in the
future

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh really maximize on
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
um because yes we needed to protect our
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
El elderly uh and I think New Hampshire
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
did that pretty well I mean we that was
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
our first population that we we looked
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
at and I think that was a really really
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
um but we also know that um the younger
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
people aren't as affected uh by this and
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
really weren't catching it or even
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
transmitting it is my understanding
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
so and we know that the next one coming
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
down the pike could affect a different
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
population we don't know what population
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
it will affect but I think in in when we
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
give out our guidance we need to be
 
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
looking at it's not necessarily the
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
entire population that's going to be
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
affected by something it's usually
 
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
targets certain sectors of the
 
00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
population and I think that's something
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
important to
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
note representative Le yeah I just want
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
to pick up comments on each of the last
 
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
few yeah things
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
um one regarding Hospital visitation I
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
would think that whatever the hospital
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
was using to attend to that
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
patient their family should be able to
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
use and in sometimes that might just be
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
looking through a window but sometimes
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
that might be a full get up or or
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
whatever um
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that would we wouldn't have
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
to know the specifics for that we would
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
just be able to recommend that whatever
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
the H whatever safety precautions the
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
hospital Personnel are using that would
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for the family to allow
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
them in um as far as things we
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
learned when we were talking about Mass
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
we were talking about other things and
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
to me what struck me was if you have a
 
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.190 align:start position:0%
to me what struck me was if you have a
full

00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
system like newer buildings do as HVAC
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
system um you can put
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
one one item in there and it would
 
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:14.839 align:start position:0%
kill what a 99 point something percent
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
of the virus that's in an Airborne virus
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
I mean we're talking about different
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
things but in an Airborne virus and for
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
schools that don't they could put
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
individual things but in the meantime
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
they could open their windows and I
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't think we did enough of that and to
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
me that was striking is how much just
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
how much effect just fresh air had and
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
just opening the windows in our
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
houses as far as inside and being
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
outside as much as possible what a an
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
improvement that would have made and
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that really
 
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.270 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that really
struck

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
struck
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
me what was the last thing you were
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
I had a list I should have written them
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
on I don't remember well if it comes to
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
one of us I did have a comment to make
 
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.430 align:start position:0%
one of us I did have a comment to make
on

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
that um the other thing just expounding
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
on what you just said is you know we
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
closed down the
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
beaches and what in discussion is Sal
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
air actually
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
helps get rid of viruses along with the
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
sunshine and everything else which also
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
produces vitamin D and everything else
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
uh to help people represent leus well
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
along those lines um one of the things I
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
think our state did very well was
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to get outside was
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
having the state parks open was
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to go visit them I
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
think that was excellent given that
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
there were other states who were
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
arresting people people for mowing their
 
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
lawn you know so that's that's something
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
that I think we did very well represent
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and I would
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
I would tend to agree with that um at
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
level I think there were some some
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
positive decisions made as far as
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
keeping outdoor areas open accessible
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
and whatnot however there were some
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that that we're not
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
strictly at the state level that we
 
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
things we could look at for instance we
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned closing the beaches that was a
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
decision made at the local level but we
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
are a Dylan's rule state and Dylan's
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
rule means that individual localities
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
can only do what they are allowed to do
 
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
as has been delegated by this body uh
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
and the one on the other side of the
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
wall concurrently to them to be allowed
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
to do so if if we didn't want them to
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
have the ability to shut down the
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
beach we could make modifications to
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
that uh in law
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh and also at the federal level I I
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
know this because I live a bit further
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
north and I know that the federal
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
government shut down the White Mountain
 
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.270 align:start position:0%
government shut down the White Mountain
National

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
National
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
Forest all the hiking trails all the
 
00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:13.799 align:start position:0%
nature the campgrounds they were
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
shut and while again at the state level
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
we made some relatively smart decisions
 
00:49:22.109 --> 00:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
to keep things open as we could as far
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
as outdoor things
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
go um I think we really need to look at
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
at um again the the local decisions that
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
were made and whether they ought to have
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to make those decisions
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
under such a case
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
and the the federal matter of shutting
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
down one of our greatest natural
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
resource sources in the state the the
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
White Mountain National Forest as well
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
as the other Federal um parks and lands
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
in this state I think that that ought to
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
be uh looked at pretty hard thank
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
you uh and just touching on uh both of
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
what you're all talking about about
 
00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.470 align:start position:0%
what you're all talking about about
being

00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
outside and bringing back in um both our
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
speakers uh from a few weeks
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
ago the social distancing
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
number because we're still asking people
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the reasons the
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
beaches were shut down is because of
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
social distancing not necessarily
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
because because of the
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
crowds and what we
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
discussed was there was no scientific
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
base is for 6 foot social
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
distancing now I don't know about
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
everybody else but I just
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
assumed and shame on me that that was
 
00:50:41.119 --> 00:50:43.030 align:start position:0%
assumed and shame on me that that was
done

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
scientifically and it
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't there was no scientific data it
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
was a random number that the federal
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
government came up with and everyone ran
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
and representative beler thank you madam
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
chair I would just add to that that we
 
00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
received testimony in this committee
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire actually
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
used I believe it was a three-foot rule
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation when it came to
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
schools because it was Impractical to
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
conform with the six-foot rule of the
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
federal government given our school
 
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
situation so we went with ref feat and
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
apparently some people thought that was
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
good enough even though the federal
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
government was say saying 6 feet and it
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like either of those had
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
any basis in evidence-based science it
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
it was simply a matter of
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
guesswork uh somewhat in the same manner
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
of although perhaps a little more
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
understandable this idea of the Swiss
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
cheese approach that they took to
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
mitigation where they decided to throw
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
everything at it to see basically see
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
what's stuck um unfortunately what that
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
meant is uh you there was so many
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
confounding variables that you couldn't
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
tell if anything worked at all or if
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
anything had a negative effect
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
individually you could tell the the full
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
series of precautions together you could
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
say well this may have done that but
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
each individual item within there there
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
was really no way to control for all the
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
other variables to see what if anything
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
worked and I I think we can say
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
generally the cumulative effect of that
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
I can't say a number as terms of
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
efficacy but I can say that
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
overall was not efficacious because it
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
seems like just about everyone in this
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
state got covid regardless of what
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
took I agree with you 100% on that um
 
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
and what I am seeing is
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
that a people that weren't vaccinated
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
getting covid people that had one
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination getting covid people that
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
have been double vaccinated getting Co
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
and people that have had every
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination getting covid
 
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
vaccination getting covid
um

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
so I don't
 
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
think I understand that they were
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about overloading the uh
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals um obviously that's what we
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
were all told that the reason we were
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
doing everything is because they didn't
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
so I kind of
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
understand maybe a little but I really
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
don't once they found out that we the
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
hospital stays the hospitals weren't
 
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.190 align:start position:0%
hospital stays the hospitals weren't
being

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed when you know why not why
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
not stop or why not pull back on
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
something representative
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
leus yeah I was thinking about the
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
effect of people who could not get in to
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
see doctors and who had appointments
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
cancelled Etc because they were trying
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure and leave that open but um
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things we haven't looked at
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
yet is the harms that were done to the
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
people because they couldn't get
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
the um appointments Etc that they needed
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
manner represent Belcher thank you madam
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
chair and again to follow up on that
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
same line of thinking and I would love
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
and I very much hope if we get some some
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
real experts and people in here from
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
from hospital associations from uh
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital owners from hospital
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
administrators to give us some good hard
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
data on this because it is my
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
because there were a combination of
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
mandates and
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations that caused people to
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
not be able to pursue normal Health Care
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
there were people just they just shut
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
everything kind of down they didn't they
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
weren't taking normal patients for
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
everyday kind of things it's my
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that hospital capacity was
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
reduced because the lot the lack of
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
income to
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals um actually CA and and the the
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
the emptiness
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
actually caused people to shut down to
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
to cut cut back on total scale so I
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
would love to get some statistics such
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
as we hear about the possibility of
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals being overwhelmed well how
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
many beds were available in each
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
Hospital in this state one year prior to
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
covid the day that covid or you know
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
maybe January of
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
21 and then January of 22 what were the
 
00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:56.839 align:start position:0%
total availability of beds not not
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
availability but the total number of
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
beds in each Hospital in each
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
ICU and I want to know if there was a
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
loss of capacity that happened as a
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
result of uh this this whole
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
circumstance so represent of belg would
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
you say that you would want to know uh
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
based on your questioning how many beds
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
were empty how many beds were occupied
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
in each of those years thank you I I
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
would love to know how many were
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
occupied and how many were empty but
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
overall I want to know just how many
 
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
there were altogether cuz I want to know
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
if there was a financial impact to
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals because of decisions that were
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
made that actually resulted in a loss of
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
capacity within the hospital system
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
generally and I think that brings us
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
through to today which I think uh this
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
effect is still happening today I
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
believe I saw on the news last night and
 
00:56:59.470 --> 00:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
I could be mistaken uh that over in Keen
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're shutting down the ICU
 
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.829 align:start position:0%
they're shutting down the ICU
unit

00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
um but I would have to double check um
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
it was I was sitting somewhere and I
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
just saw something flash up quickly
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
but representative belch thank you uh
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
and and yes to and to that point I would
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
I would add not just do I want to know
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
beds but I also want to know Staffing as
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
far as um adequate Physicians adequate
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
nursing Personnel um and any others who
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
are required to keep hospitals
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
functioning because I guess at the end
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
of the day if you've got 200 beds but
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
only enough staff to cover 150 of them
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's an important thing to know too so
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get this these numbers over
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
time starting before Co during Co and
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
and now to see what the impact has been
 
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh to our system in
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
general represent blus to that effect um
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
how much did the vaccine mandates affect
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
the Staffing because I know here the
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
conquered hospital I did talk to a
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
number of those um professionals and
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
they were talking how many of them had
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
left um because they
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
were from what they saw they did not
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
want to get the
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
vaccines and had already gone and gotten
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
other jobs and they were talking about
 
00:58:25.799 --> 00:58:26.670 align:start position:0%
other jobs and they were talking about
how

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
they were almost on emergency Staffing
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
at that point so and they didn't know
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
what would happen once the deadline
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
passed and people were forced to leave
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
um they weren't sure that they could you
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
know they were they were predicting that
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
people would would start to die from
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
lack of Health
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
Care I can tell you that at the county
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
level and I'm sure that each of you have
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
experien this with your own County
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
um that the mandates truly did affect
 
00:59:05.799 --> 00:59:06.710 align:start position:0%
um that the mandates truly did affect
the

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
Personnel um but it was more than that
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
because of federal guidance that came
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
down the contractors or subcontractors
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
going to the nursing home had to comply
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
with the vaccines and so therefore they
 
00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
were having trouble getting work done
 
00:59:27.079 --> 00:59:28.750 align:start position:0%
were having trouble getting work done
um

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
because they had to be documented and
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
show um that they were complying with
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
all the mandates uh coming down from the
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
federal government um and not the state
 
00:59:47.549 --> 00:59:47.559 align:start position:0%
government but the federal government
 
00:59:47.559 --> 00:59:49.230 align:start position:0%
government but the federal government
um

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
so I think also there might have been
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
some disconnect into what the state was
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
saying and then what the Fed ederal
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
government was telling the state and I
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
think that's something that we really
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
need to delve into too is to look at
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
what federal mandates what did the state
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
want to do what did we have to do
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
because of the the federal mandates um
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
and how did it affect our care I know
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
that you know our nursing home our
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
County Nursing Home level dropped in the
 
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
number of patients they could have um
 
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.510 align:start position:0%
number of patients they could have um
and

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
because they deal with Medicaid and
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare dollars um they have to be very
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
cautious because those monies will be
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
withheld um for re from reimbursement if
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
they don't comply with the federal
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
guidance over the state guidance um and
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
I know in our area it had a drastic
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
effect um on services at the county
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
level represented beler thank you madam
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
chair and and to follow again and kind
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
of the same idea I'd like to get
 
01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
information from I I suppose it would
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
probably be
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS regarding and I think we may have
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
actually posed this question but I'll
 
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
say it here anyway um what was known
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
over time about the efficacy of the
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
various uh vaccines and mRNA injections
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
for covid um it's going to play into
 
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
this idea about about mandates uh for
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
healthc Care Professionals
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
because right now the argument that I
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
hear made most often for vaccination is
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
that it reduces mortality and that's
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
primarily amongst the elderly and there
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
may actually be a net benefit to some of
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
the people in a certain age group from
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
the vaccine for reducing mortality
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's entirely
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
plausible but the only the only
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable argument for making a
 
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
requirement of the vaccine among among
 
01:01:56.039 --> 01:01:57.109 align:start position:0%
requirement of the vaccine among among
Healthcare

01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
Healthcare
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
professionals would be if it actually
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
prevents you from
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
spreading the virus to your patient
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
population that's the only reasonable
 
01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
argument we made for it and it seems to
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
me that by the time we had one or two um
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
boosters rolled out it was it was
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
evident that the ability of this of
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
these vaccines to prevent the spread of
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
the virus was at at best
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
minimal um again there may be a benefit
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
to mortality especially in a certain age
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
group but what was originally said the
 
01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
idea that if and I this came from
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
federal officials said if you get the
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine you will not get the virus well
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
it it didn't take long for that to be
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to be inaccurate um and as
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
I said basically almost everyone seems
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
to have gotten it eventually despite the
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
presence of vaccines so I'd like to know
 
01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
know when we understood at a
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
professional level that the vaccines did
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
not have a substantial effect on the
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
transmissibility of the virus and how
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
that overlaid with various mandates
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
Professionals that is an interesting
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh question and very thoughtful I didn't
 
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
actually think of it that way and I
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you're bringing that up
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative beler representative
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
le as I recall and it would be nice to
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
get verification on this but um before
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
and at the beginning of the vaccine roll
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
out the federal government was saying
 
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
that it would not was known that it
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
would not stop the spread therefore
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
masks and if that was known why were we
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
mandating well the other question is is
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
as we learned about mask why did they
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
say that we had to wear a mask and who
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
was driving that bus and did they have
 
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
specialist uh looking into the Micron of
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
the virus versus the microns that the
 
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
mask actually
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
stopped represent
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
black the other thing um based on
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard is that we've
 
01:04:31.279 --> 01:04:33.029 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard is that we've
had

01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
no um deaths of was it children under
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
five children under 12 I don't remember
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
what the number was due to the vaccine
 
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
but we've had a number I mean due to the
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
due to covid but we have had a number
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
due to the vaccine and yet we are still
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
pushing vaccinations for young people
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
and I would love love to know why we're
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
still doing
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
that I I think the bigger question is is
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
were those dollars coming from for the
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
advertisement of it um is it from the
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
state is it from ARA funds or is it from
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds I mean I understand arar
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
federal funds but is there still money
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
coming down for that I guess is is the
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
question represent Bel thank you madam
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
chair and my prior question that I posed
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
appli to that situation in exactly the
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
same manner which is it it didn't take
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
long for us to understand as a society
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
that this was not a virus that had at
 
01:05:35.319 --> 01:05:36.430 align:start position:0%
that this was not a virus that had at
least

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
acute nasty effects for children the
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
long-term effects it's a little harder
 
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
to know but the the acute phase this was
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
not tending to kill
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
children so the same argument applies
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
and we heard this over and over again
 
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
that effectively we need to vaccinate
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
children so they don't kill grandma
 
01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
but that argument relies on the idea
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
that the vaccine stops the transmission
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
of the virus so at what point did we
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
know that the vaccine did not actually
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
stop the transmission of the virus
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
despite possibly having a mortality
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
benefit or populations elsewhere we knew
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
that it didn't stop the transmission of
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
the virus and did we then stop
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to switch topics a little bit
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
um we heard from the commissioner of um
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
education commissioner edel
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
blo um who testified here that he tried
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
to give a uh positive
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
message uh out to people
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
but then we also have heard from the
 
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
public that fear was instilled with in
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
them basically uh every
 
01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:08.309 align:start position:0%
them basically uh every
day

01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
um I know I can
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
testify to this
 
01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
committee that I was on a phone call um
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
they have White House intergovernmental
 
01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:20.029 align:start position:0%
they have White House intergovernmental
phone

01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
phone
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
calls uh and they were having one um I
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
believe was in April of May uh right
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
after the
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
shutdowns and the call was about mental
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
health of the shutdown it was
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
about the rise in
 
01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:42.380 align:start position:0%
alcoholism it was about the rise and
 
01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:43.950 align:start position:0%
alcoholism it was about the rise and
[Music]

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
addiction so early
 
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
on being on that call with people at the
 
01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.789 align:start position:0%
on being on that call with people at the
federal

01:07:53.789 --> 01:07:53.799 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:55.570 align:start position:0%
level they knew
 
01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:57.789 align:start position:0%
level they knew
[Music]

01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
knew and I shouldn't say they knew but
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
based on the phone call there was a
 
01:08:08.269 --> 01:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
great understanding that this shutdown
 
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
would increase mental health issues
 
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
would increase addiction would increase
 
01:08:14.599 --> 01:08:16.550 align:start position:0%
would increase addiction would increase
alcoholism

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
alcoholism
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
call and as I was listening and then saw
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
what we were doing not only as a state
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
but as a
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
country knowing that the long-term
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
effects of this were going to be Untold
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
and we didn't know how many years out we
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
were going to continue to see the
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
effects of this why it took so
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
long to get the information out and
 
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.030 align:start position:0%
long to get the information out and
why

01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't helping people and putting things
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
in a positive light instead of scaring
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
everybody and putting fear into them and
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
affecting their mental health and
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
increasing addiction and alcoholism and
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
education why did we let the artive go
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
on I understand that we need to be
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about public health and public
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
policy is
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
important but I think sitting here in
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
this committee listening to some of
 
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
these Specialists I don't think the
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
Specialists were contacted I
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
think that there was a
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
narrative and I am truly truly
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
concerned that the truth was kept from
 
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.430 align:start position:0%
concerned that the truth was kept from
us

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
not totally and I don't want to say that
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
because I think at the beginning nobody
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
knew I really do believe we were all
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
guessing but when I'm telling you that
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
it was in April or May of that year
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
after the shutdowns in March they were
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
already talking about these
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
issues that's that's a problem and it's
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
something that while we're talking about
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
the shutdowns and telling people to do
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
this and issuing these mandates we
 
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
needed to be talking about these other
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
issues um and the effects that it could
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
have on people the delay in the
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
education of their children the delay by
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask how you're hindering a
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
child's communication
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
skills um and the way they communicate
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
in the way they
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
understand that creates long-term
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
issues I knew a school
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
teacher who had a student come back to
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
school and was so
 
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable removing his mask because
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
he didn't know how to be without it
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
anymore he was
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
afraid I think that in our report
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
although we're looking at the federal
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
mandates but the emergency use and the
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
guidance we need to be looking at the
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
true effects and the mental health
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
issues and what we what has how it has
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
affected Society in general I think
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
I understand that's very broad but I
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
think it's extremely
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
important representative
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
to uh sort of follow up on on the
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
concept um of Public Health and I I want
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
to officially go on the record and and
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
offer this argument for the committee's
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
consideration and others as to what I
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
see is as a fundamental problem that
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
might be something we either this
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee or us as legislators can
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
eventually look to address
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
so public health is a little bit of a
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
misnomer okay so the public doesn't have
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
health people have health I have health
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
you have health I have health problems
 
01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
the public has
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
statistics regarding health so when you
 
01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
when you take the concept of Health away
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
from the individual and you put it on
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
the public you're dealing with
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
Statistics and immediately right off the
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
bat you're collectivizing you're taking
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
it away from the individual and toward a
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
collective and that lens when you begin
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
to look at things through a public
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
health lens you cannot help but begin to
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
view people by populations by
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
demographics instead of as individuals
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
with individual rights and individual
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
agency to make their own
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
decisions um and that brings us into
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
some very very dangerous territory where
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
through the lens of Public Health nearly
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
anything can be
 
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
justified if it is of net
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
benefit in theory to the
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
public and it's my personal belief may
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
not be shared by other groups but it is
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
my personal belief that the legitimate
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
functions of Public Health should
 
01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
probably be seen as defense
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
functions and the idea of Public Health
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
generally should go away in favor of
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
individual health individual agency and
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
making

01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
represent uh thank you
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on previous uh could you
 
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:48.950 align:start position:0%
so to follow up on previous uh could you
give

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
give
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
some concrete example as it
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh um relate to co
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
response how it would be different if we
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be uh focused on individual health
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
instead of Public Health
 
01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
instead of Public Health
because

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I fully understood
 
01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I fully understood
your

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
concept sure and I I hate to get too
 
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
detailed because this is more of a
 
01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
general concept but I can give you I can
 
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
give you one example that seems in my
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
mind to make sense so let's take the
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
concept of of masking to begin with now
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
this was as we heard part of what was
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
called a Swiss cheese approach where we
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
effectively just threw everything at the
 
01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
wall to see what's what would stick
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
right and from the public health lens
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
this was seen as a collective item to
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
get everybody to do this thing in the
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
hopes that if everybody did this it
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
would lower the total um what you would
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
call AR not or rate of spread of the
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
disease low enough to not overwhelm
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals or cause significant
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
individual harms to people people when
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to look at this more through
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
an individualist lens we would actually
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
see that well first of all people have
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
agency and they people are not fully
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
rational by any means but they do tend
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
to make decisions in their own benefit
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
all right if you didn't do that every
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
single day you wouldn't live very long
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
so people have the ability to make
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
decisions for thems and if you were
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the circumstances as they
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
rolled out you might have thought to
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
yourself well
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
why would I ask all of these other
 
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
people to wear a cloth mask that
 
01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
definitely doesn't offer any protection
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
if I were to wear a cloth mask that's
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
not going to prevent me from getting
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
sick I might instead choose to wear an
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
n95 or n100 mask that although we've
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
heard at this point that that probably
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have worked either because of
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
the various issues that go on with it at
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
least an individual might have thought
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
themselves well if I wear an n95 or n100
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
I can prevent myself from getting sick
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
and if I'm relying on myself and my own
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
agency and my own actions to prevent
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
myself from getting sick and staying
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
safe I don't have to worry about what
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
these other hundred people around me are
 
01:16:13.229 --> 01:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
doing because I'm protecting myself I'm
 
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
taking rational actions to protect
 
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
myself and when you think along those
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
lines it provides a lot less um impetus
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
to universally regulate everything
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
require everybody to do the same thing
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
and to demonize people who won't go
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
along with the program because they
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
might have a different thought about
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
things so let me just understand
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher um based on
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
represen PO off's question um I had
 
01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.510 align:start position:0%
represen PO off's question um I had
constituents

01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
um that are highly H
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
claustrophobic and so wearing a mask
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
mask was an
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
extremely uh emotional and very
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
difficult thing for them to do just even
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
to go into a doctor's office um there
 
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
were also other people
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
um that have had other traumatic things
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
happened to them and a mask reminded and
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
brought up those uh
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
images um and they had to relive
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
something over again again a mental
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
health issue so basically if they felt
 
01:17:30.669 --> 01:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
that it was better for them or healthier
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.390 align:start position:0%
for them
[Music]

01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
um not to wear one based on what you're
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
saying as an individual versus a public
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable yes I I think again when you
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
when you look at things through an
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
individual lens where we all have agency
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
and we make somewhat rational
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
decisions you can say okay
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
well maybe the mask is going to help me
 
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit but my claustrophobia
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
regarding this is going to my
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
life my livelihood and you might decide
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
as an individual that the risk or
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
downside of that outweighs the the
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
positive side of that and perhaps some
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
people think well that's a crazy thought
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
but is it actually a crazy thought when
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
that person actually almost certainly
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
sit statistically caught Co anyway even
 
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
mask yeah but we didn't know that people
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
were going to everybody uh was going to
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
Catch Co at the time I'm just go playing
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
going along here um we know that most
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
people or I know
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
that basically not everyone that has
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated but most people that I
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
know that have been vaccinated have had
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
covid at one point or another um
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
um but I think that also took some time
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
um but what I did know do know from
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
listening is with the microns which to
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
me was even more important but I
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying about the
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
individual um I think one of the things
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
that people weren't taking into
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
consideration is the how things are
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
going to affect people's mental health
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that when we look at any
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic or anything in the future we
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
need to look at the mental health of of
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
people individuals
 
01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
um you know is it going to increase
 
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
alcoholism is it going to increase drug
 
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
addiction you know I mean these are side
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
effects that we don't we're not
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
discussing is this going to increase
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
delayed learning is you
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
know all these issues
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
I think when we're looking at these
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
level I don't know if they've were
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
looked at ahead of time and I guess I
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
would ask the question were they looked
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
at ahead of time representative Bela
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
than representative thank you madam
 
01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
chair and just to just to help flush out
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
what I was suggesting about the public
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
health lens what you were just
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting I think is generally accurate
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
because we we need to take in the
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
totality of things when we're making
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
decisions like this um we we've we know
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen an increase in what we call
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
deaths of Despair related to mental
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
health issues related to drug and
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse and whatnot but the
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
difference between an individualist lens
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
versus a public health lens let's take
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol for instance well if we looked
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
at this through the public health lens
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
and said well if we make this decision
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
regarding these shutdowns and these mass
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
and everything else we're going to we're
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
going to drive an increase in alcoholism
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
and and all the problems that come along
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
with that well the public health
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
solution to that very well might be
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
let's enact prohibition let's ban
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol But the individualist lens to
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
that might look at that same situation
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
and say well maybe we should actually
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
let people do what they think is best
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
from the word go so we don't have these
 
01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
side effects like increased alcoholism
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we let people go on about their
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
lives make their own decisions and their
 
01:21:25.679 --> 01:21:28.149 align:start position:0%
lives make their own decisions and their
own

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
interests represent
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
leus following Along on these just from
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
a personal point of
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
view with my asthma which was very
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
kicked up for the first while of that
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
anytime I put on a mask my O2 would
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
drop and so basically I didn't go
 
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere because I couldn't I would have
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
to wear a mask but if I wear a mask then
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
breathe and um I became very depressed
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm a people
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
person and
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
eventually well eventually I followed
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
the second half of our state motto and
 
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die there things worse than
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
death and that's what I decided and I
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
decided being so depressed was worse and
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
I did start seeing people
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
Outdoors um without my mask private
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
private Le so you know so I could go
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
places that people weren't enforcing
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
that I had a mask on and understood that
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
I really couldn't wear a mask but people
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the individual as opposed
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
collectivist I do believe that in the ex
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
emergency orders that the governor did
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
Issue there was an exemption um for
 
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
people with medically related things and
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
I think that's important to note that we
 
01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
as a state did Implement that go ahead
 
01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.070 align:start position:0%
as a state did Implement that go ahead
represent

01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill that is indeed uh it's an important
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
distinction especially the from the
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
legal front but as as we've heard um
 
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
there was such
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
a a environment or atmosphere of of fear
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
and not just fear because we can't stop
 
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
there there was an attitude of
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
hatred that came along with all of these
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
things that happened that I know some
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
people even if it was not what they
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to do were wearing masks even
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
with health conditions because they did
 
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
not want to be accosted at the grocery
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
store by people who would be offended
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
that they weren't taking their
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
collectivist responsibilties
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
seriously represent
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
leus well that was something that I did
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
learn was that people don't actually
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
read governor 's uh
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
orders I obviously had read them I mean
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
as a rep we had to know what was going
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
on right and I knew that I didn't have
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
to wear the
 
01:24:05.199 --> 01:24:06.709 align:start position:0%
to wear the
mask

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
mask
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
but most people didn't and you try to go
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
into a business you try to go into just
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
about any place that wasn't somebody's
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
home even somebody's home um and be told
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
that's the law and you'd have to explain
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
no it's actually not the law
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
but people didn't know and even when you
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
explained that they didn't necessarily
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
believe you and so there were a lot of
 
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
places instituting what they thought was
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
the law which was not and I
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
was I would not just about Mass but
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
about a number of things we'd G you know
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
the whole tracking and go to a
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant and leaving your phone number
 
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
and all of that kind of
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
stuff there were so many things that if
 
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
you read the governor's
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
orders it's they said one thing and if
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
you went into any kind of business or
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
whatever they said completely something
 
01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
completely different because they
 
01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:07.639 align:start position:0%
thought they were following the
 
01:25:07.639 --> 01:25:09.870 align:start position:0%
thought they were following the
law

01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
well it's kind of like a catch
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
22 yes we had the emergency orders and
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
they were open but they were also
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
considered a private business so they
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
can enact their own protocols
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
just to be clear represent black I got
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
that I got that and and certainly if a
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
private business said to me this is our
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
policy that's fine but a lot of them
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
were doing it because they thought they
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
were following the law and that was the
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
thing that I really noticed
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you madam
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
chair and to follow with that it's it's
 
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
a matter of which law or which guidance
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
was being followed because
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
let me tell you when when we were at the
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
height of the pandemic and I I would go
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
into businesses or doctor's offices or
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
wherever I don't recall once seeing the
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency order posted on the
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
front door but what I did see was
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
guidance from the CDC or the who or
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
other organizations that in many cases
 
01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:19.719 align:start position:0%
was substantially different than what
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
was actually the law or or the executive
 
01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
orders here in New Hampshire so I think
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
there there was probably a lot of uh
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
confusion and a lot of people unsure of
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
where to look where I think there was a
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
lot of people unsure of what the actual
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
Authority was of the various entities
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
putting these things in place whether
 
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
Governor's executive orders trumped the
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
CDC or the who or whether the hospitals
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines trumped what or I think I
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
think there was a lot of confusion
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
involved and people kind of defaulted to
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
the strictest set of
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh represent Bel I I do agree
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
with you we heard here from commissioner
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
edbl um Commissioner of
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
Education that they sent down some
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines but School boards chose the
 
01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
CDC or the who guidelines uh so instead
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
of following New Hampshire guidelines
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
they went to the federal
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
guidelines and I think
 
01:27:25.719 --> 01:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
guidelines and I think
you

01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
know I don't know how we do this in the
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
future but I think it needs to be
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
extremely clear that you know New
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has its guidelines it needs to
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
be spelled out it needs to be saying
 
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
that we are actually looking out for Ev
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
every individual in our state we are
 
01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about you and these are the
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
guidelines that we're instituting
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
because we feel that it is the most
 
01:27:59.790 --> 01:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the individuals and the
 
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
citizens in our state um yes you'll be
 
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
hearing other other
 
01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines but those are
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
generalized um you know we see this all
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
the time right represent
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and again we
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
can we can tie in whether we ever decide
 
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
to put this in any report but I would
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
make the argument
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
that um Powers such as were exercised
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
during a
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic such as quarantine for instance
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
are inherently police
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
Powers police powers are inherently a
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
power of the
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
state I am not personally aware of
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere where police Powers have
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
generally been delegated by the state to
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government and certainly not
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
to any
 
01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
supernational uh organization or
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
governance um so it it would be
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
my um view that this is one of those
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
matters under the 10th Amendment where
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
the state the state Authority ought
 
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:15.070 align:start position:0%
the state the state Authority ought
reign

01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
supreme I do believe though that if you
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
clicked on protocols on certain websites
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
at the state level they would bring you
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
to the CDC
 
01:29:31.109 --> 01:29:31.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines so if we have under emergency
 
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
orders one set of
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines but then an agency's website
 
01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.310 align:start position:0%
guidelines but then an agency's website
is

01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
issuing the federal
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines or the Department of
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
Education says one thing but we're still
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
issuing under like you know like I said
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
in another department the federal
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines there is some confusing data
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
out there for the public um
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
we find this all the time um especially
 
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
in agriculture uh
 
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
confusion so I think trying to
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
streamline and make sure that all the
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
everybody's on the same page and maybe
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's something that should go in the
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
report that the guidelines should be the
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines for the
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
state um and it should be uniform across
 
01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.470 align:start position:0%
state um and it should be uniform across
all

01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.490 align:start position:0%
all
agencies

01:30:27.490 --> 01:30:27.500 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.070 align:start position:0%
agencies
[Music]

01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know how that would happen
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
um you know what the protocol of that
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
would be but I think it's it's because
 
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
when people start getting conflicting
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
information and it happens a lot uh in a
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
lot of different areas um it's tough um
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
you know especially when you're dealing
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
with the whole emotional thing of Co and
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know how many people were leaving
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
their groceries outside and then washing
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
them down before they brought them in
 
01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:04.830 align:start position:0%
them down before they brought them in
their

01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
house um or people were afraid to come
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
outside even I mean even though we know
 
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
fresh air is healthy but just the fear
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
instilled but if you have conflicting
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
how how do people know what's true and
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
what's not representative P up then
 
01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.470 align:start position:0%
what's not representative P up then
representative

01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
Bel and um following up on idea that
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
approach that was implemented was SSS
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
cheese approach when everything possible
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
was used uh in reality I think uh it was
 
01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
not everything and uh we saw some
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
mandates when some measures were hardly
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
pushed or even mandated but at the same
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
time um at some time period so for the
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
whole period we saw some measures
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
were prohibited uh in some or other way
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
and like we know that in this state
 
01:32:16.109 --> 01:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion if people
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
should be uh uh it should be easier for
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
people to use tin uh for treatment and
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
the was push against this so it was not
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
like Swiss CH in this regard like we're
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
saying oh this approach is now good even
 
01:32:37.109 --> 01:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
for masking like I probably
 
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
overreacted and played on safe side so I
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
was one of the maybe first people who
 
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
wore a 95 mask among public when uh like
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
dmos hitch HW Hospital nobody
 
01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
from their staff was wearing any mask
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
and part of it was probably trying to
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
save PP uh saving equipment for part of
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
it maybe trying to not instill Panic so
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
at some point they were like okay not
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
wear a mask don't ins still panic and
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
then they're like not wear mask not
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
panic panic um so so uh some measures uh
 
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
I probably can come up with other
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
examples uh with antibodies like for a
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
while monoclonal antibodies were not
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
recommended uh so it's kind of the
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
removed from Swiss cheese approach and
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
then they were kind of they were
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
nationalized so they they started to be
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
recommended but you couldn't do it like
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
privately or on state level you had to
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
like wait for federal government to
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
distribute your fair share of monoclonal
 
01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
antibodies for covid treatment so it's
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
again it was like kind of very limited
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
so so represent P what you're saying is
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
that although the Swiss cheese approach
 
01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
that although the Swiss cheese approach
was

01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:34:16.639 --> 01:34:18.590 align:start position:0%
was
applied

01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
applied
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
prevention there was that was opposite
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
of what was applied for treatment is
 
01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.350 align:start position:0%
of what was applied for treatment is
that

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
correct more like it's was more
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
nuanced situation than just Swiss ch's
 
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
approach so yeah I tried to use many
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
measures both for prevention and for
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
treatment but then quite a few measures
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
that should have been used were not used
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it I I see it as more complex
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
than just uh applying every possible
 
01:35:00.109 --> 01:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
measure that is
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable thank you represent Belair
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just to return to
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of the the powers and the
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
different guidance coming from different
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
entities what I might
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
recommend is that if police powers are
 
01:35:17.229 --> 01:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
rightly the power of the state and these
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
fall under the category of police Powers
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
then all guidance that has the effect or
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
force of law
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
ought to be coming from the state and
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
only the state now that's not to say
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
that people out there can't can't follow
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
CDC or who or whatever guidance they
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
want to because they're free people but
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
if it's going to carry the effect of law
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
it should only be coming from the state
 
01:35:42.990 --> 01:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
and that also doesn't mean that the
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
state can't do what the CDC is doing for
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
instance it just has to adopt it as the
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
state's guidance not CDC guidance to say
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
this is our guidance which means they
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
they have not only the authority to to
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
do it but they also carry the liability
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
of doing it because one of the biggest
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
problems I see with this whole
 
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
situation is that it seems like the
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
entire thing has from the federal level
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
to the who to the state level to the
 
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
executive to everywhere it seems like
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
it's formed a web of bureaucracy that
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
has managed to spread responsibility and
 
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
liability so thin that nobody can be
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
held to account for anything and and the
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
buck doesn't stop anywhere for anything
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
that happen happened so it seems like
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
for my two cents state only should be
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
issuing guidance that carries the effect
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
of Law and it also shouldn't be able to
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
take any um any federal dollars that
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
come with requirements to issue things
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
that have the effective law because that
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
violates the 10th Amendment and the
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
separation of authority and powers
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
between the state and federal
 
01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:51.159 align:start position:0%
government could you expound on that a
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
little bit when you talk about um that
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be taking Federal money uh
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you in this particular
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
case what I what I mean is that if there
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
are if there is federal money that comes
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
with any mandates that we going to
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
affect on the people that would
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
represent police Powers because
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
everything we do from requiring masks to
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
quarantine those are all police Powers
 
01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
so the federal government isn't really
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to have police Powers so if
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get around that by
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
saying well we're going to going to give
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
you money but only if you enact these
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
police Powers that's actually a
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
violation of the separation of authority
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
between the state and federal government
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
and that should be in my eyes that
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so maybe when we have
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
um director buckton and we will be able
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
to uh find out if there were any
 
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
mandates I mean any um
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.159 --> 01:38:03.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
leus something that was touched on that
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think we really need to focus on was
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
the um treatments and the
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
limitations of the
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
treatments there were was seemed to be
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
doctors and hospitals who were part of
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
organizations who could not give
 
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
treatments that private doctors were
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
giving very
 
01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.070 align:start position:0%
giving very
successfully

01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
and I would like to know more about how
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
that all came to be what the who was
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
making those decisions and why were many
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the pharmacies even if a h even if a
 
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.109 align:start position:0%
of the pharmacies even if a h even if a
doctor

01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
prescribed one of those medications like
 
01:39:00.189 --> 01:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
ior mecanism just a for
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
example um why then were they
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
unavailable why were pharmacies refusing
 
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
to fill
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
them when that was a medicine that is
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
supply so represent let let me see if I
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
understand what you're
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
saying you're saying that private
 
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.270 align:start position:0%
saying you're saying that private
doctors

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
were issuing different
 
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
medications than say and I I'm I'm
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
confused about private versus others
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay if you could expound on that a
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
little bit and the other question is are
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
you saying that pharmacists in New
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were refusing to refill uh
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
fill a prescription from New Hampshire
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
doctors so um the private versus
 
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.270 align:start position:0%
doctors so um the private versus
organization

01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
the doctors who were part of
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
organizations were being told from
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
higher up in their organization you
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
can't do this or you'll be
 
01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
fired so when you say an organization so
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
um well I I'll just use uh so like you
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
have conquered hospital and a lot you
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot of doctors under the umbrella
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
of conquered hospital is that what
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
you're considering an organization yes
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
versus like a concierge doctor or
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
someone in private practice like
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who's part of say Dartmouth
 
01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock for instance Dartmouth
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock doctors all had to follow Dr
 
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock procedure you know
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
all across the state if they were
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
Affiliated they had to follow those
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
whatever those guidelines were those
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
with Southern New Hampshire which I
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
forget what
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
their current name
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
is but those had to follow those rules
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
if you were a private doctor who was not
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
affiliated with anybody else you could
 
01:41:04.109 --> 01:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
then because it wasn't federally illegal
 
01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
you could do things that you could not
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
do under the guidance of whoever oversaw
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
or without threat of being fired okay so
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
you just said something and I just want
 
01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
to see you said federally
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
illegal um you said that they you
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
know so I'm I'm trying to really grasp
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
dive into what you're saying there so if
 
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:31.870 align:start position:0%
dive into what you're saying there so if
you

01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
so partly it's what you prescribe and it
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
might be FDA approved but you can't
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
prescribe it because you've been told
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
not to but another part of that that we
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
came across was um um getting
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
medical exceptions for taking
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
um where did that where did that
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
guidance come from because there were
 
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
doctors there was one that I know of who
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
really wanted to give a medical
 
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
exemption for one of his
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
patients it was a nurse um so that she
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have to get vaccinated in order
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
to keep working and was
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
basically said I can't give this to you
 
01:42:32.589 --> 01:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
or I will lose my job that's coming from
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
above but I I she had he had already
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
told her I don't think you should ever
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
take another vaccine from the reaction
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
you had with the last one you may have a
 
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
complete allergic reaction which she did
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
and apparently with within like seven
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
seconds of having died from the amount
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
of time she wasn't breathing before they
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
were able to start her breathing again
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
after she got the vaccine where did that
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
come from who made those
 
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
decisions okay so I'm just going to
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
rephrase this just so for for
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
understanding purposes and I think it
 
01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.350 align:start position:0%
understanding purposes and I think it
ties

01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
ties
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
into what the mom that we heard
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the daughter had some issues and
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
medical doctor said no no you should
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
this person here um the doctor knew that
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
this person should not receive the
 
01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.030 align:start position:0%
this person should not receive the
vaccine

01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
however he couldn't give her the
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
exemption because the organization or
 
01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
somebody says you cannot give any
 
01:43:49.599 --> 01:43:50.830 align:start position:0%
somebody says you cannot give any
medical

01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions um
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
so the nurse it's my understanding based
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
on what you just said did receive the
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine and she had a terrible
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
breathing

01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
breathing
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
so the question comes is when the
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
medical industry says they will do no
 
01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:24.189 align:start position:0%
medical industry says they will do no
harm

01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
even though they're told that they know
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
something is going to be harmful to
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
someone but they're
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
taking their Li but then they have to
 
01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
weigh in their livelihood over something
 
01:44:37.599 --> 01:44:38.589 align:start position:0%
weigh in their livelihood over something
that's

01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:38.599 --> 01:44:40.189 align:start position:0%
that's
harmful

01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
harmful
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
um what does that do to that particular
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
doctor especially knowing that this
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
person just in order to keep her
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
job did exactly was trying to avoid
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what he told that doctor told
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
her not to do he couldn't follow his own
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
guidance and knew it was medically right
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
person

01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
so there seems to be a moral conflict
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere in
 
01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.430 align:start position:0%
somewhere in
here

01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that's something that's
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
important to note and you're not the
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
first person that has told me of a story
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
similar to this
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
um so this
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
isn't it's more prevalent than what we
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
we we we would think
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
and it should be caused for concern for
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
everybody because if they're telling you
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
over something that they know is going
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
to harm you because of a your condition
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
or something
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
how many other times are they doing that
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
in other
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
instances not related to
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
covid representative Belcher thank you
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair and on a on a very similar
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
topic I I would love to get somebody
 
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
who's capable of
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
testifying um particularly to the uh the
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
expert analysis of scientific study
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
because one of the things things I've
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
heard more and more recently um
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
particularly regarding some of the
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals that we've we've been uh
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
sort of alluding to here is that there's
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
this concept
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
within um within statistics and Analysis
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
called a funnel
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
plot a funnel
 
01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
plot and the idea is that within sort of
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
MAA analysis of studies meaning you're
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a bunch of different studies
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
on the same topic
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
that you can apply this concept called
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
The Funnel
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
plot and it will give you an idea as to
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
whether there has been bias in the
 
01:47:05.119 --> 01:47:06.109 align:start position:0%
whether there has been bias in the
published

01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
published
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
research and what I've heard is
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
that an awful lot of uh pharmaceutical
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
research that comes out these days
 
01:47:19.589 --> 01:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
actually fails the funnel plot which
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
suggests that there's selective
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
publication of certain um themes either
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
for or against certain
 
01:47:32.189 --> 01:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals um as if there's a bias
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
involved so I would love to hear more
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
about uh about that from uh experts in
 
01:47:43.229 --> 01:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
the field to learn if there is indeed um
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
bias on the part of the major journals
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
who are publishing these sorts of
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
research um why that might be are there
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
incent incentives in place that would uh
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
cause that to come about um is there
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
ideological reasons are there financial
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
reasons um and what ultimately
 
01:48:07.589 --> 01:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations we might be able to make
 
01:48:07.599 --> 01:48:08.709 align:start position:0%
recommendations we might be able to make
to

01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
um correct any any uh any problems that
 
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.629 align:start position:0%
um correct any any uh any problems that
might

01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
exist and could you uh tell me where
 
01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
fall sure because we we there obviously
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
within the state level there were
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations and or mandates for
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
various pharmaceutical products um both
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of preventatives and treatments
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
that would speak to whether or not the
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
expert evaluation of these
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals um were subjected to a
 
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.109 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals um were subjected to a
bias-free

01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation um or whether there was a
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
incentive structure or narrative or
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
ideology or anything else in place that
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
might have tilted the balance away from
 
01:48:58.990 --> 01:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
Pure science and towards something
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
else so what you're saying is not only
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
the mandates for preventative basically
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
the Swiss cheese approach but there are
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
also mandates uh for when you received
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
when you had covid and there were
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
mandates by the
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
state sure uh mandates Andor
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations um but in either case
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
mandates or recommendations would have
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
certainly been based on what would be
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
called consensus or expert opinion
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
expert opinion would have of course
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
taken into account the Publications in
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
major research journals everything from
 
01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
you know science to Nature um so if
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's a problem at the heart of that
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
right down to the bias possibility of
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
bias being introduced at the level of
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
publishing in major research journals
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
that would trickle down all the way to
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
the guy ID and and uh mandates being
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
recommended by state Personnel regarding
 
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh both treatments and preventatives for
 
01:50:06.589 --> 01:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
covid um and if there's a problem there
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
I mean if if there's a problem at that
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
deepest level that would taint
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
everything all the way down the line so
 
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know more about
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
that uh and I'm just going to be a
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
little adversarial here I
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
mean there's bias in
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
everything um so I guess the question is
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
is um I'm a numbers person it's kind of
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
black and white they either say this or
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
they say that you really can't
 
01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
manipulate them too much um so what
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
is is the data being purely uh presented
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
as the data or is it being manipulated
 
01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.189 align:start position:0%
as the data or is it being manipulated
in

01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
some yes and I would like to do that I
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
would like to hear that's that's why I
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
want to hear from an expert in
 
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
scientific and statistical analysis who
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
can come in here and explain to us what
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
is a funnel plot is it true that within
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical research it often fails a
 
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
funnel plot such that it highly suggests
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
bias in
 
01:51:14.189 --> 01:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
publication um and why that might be uh
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
because again we're science-based and I
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
want to do this in science by the
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
numbers and statistics is I think one of
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
the better ways to go about looking at
 
01:51:23.229 --> 01:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
that so if if it if it fails a funnel
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
plot if there's evidence of
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
packing um which is a way to manipulate
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
statistical results um I think we should
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
know if that's happening um or
 
01:51:38.589 --> 01:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
not represent
 
01:51:41.069 --> 01:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
POA thank you Madame chair I want to
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
follow up on
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative leus um testimonia and uh
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh in my view it's uh important for us
 
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
to trying to understand um where it came
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
from uh when people were denied uh
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
proper exemptions from vaccination and
 
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
we know it's not limited just for
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals we heard many stories about um
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
military personnel uh were
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
widely um denied any exemptions I
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
personally know um New England policeman
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh who was uh
 
01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
fired uh because he was in the process
 
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
of um getting exemption and it was
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
impossible it was made impossible he was
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
not the only one and it took him I don't
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
know how many like uh two years how many
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
finally uh a number of them won in the
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
court and uh uh
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
reinstated but uh the damage was already
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
done uh to the public and uh people by
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's I want to know why why doctors were
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
pushed and who pushed them to deny
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
exemptions represent vure thank you
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for that uh
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative bazov because that is
 
01:53:30.669 --> 01:53:30.679 align:start position:0%
actually an avenue I would like to
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
explore a little bit as well because it
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
does seem to me and I'd like to explore
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of the case law history and
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
what not behind this because it seems to
 
01:53:41.159 --> 01:53:41.950 align:start position:0%
what not behind this because it seems to
me

01:53:41.950 --> 01:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
that historically when people were to
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
seek conscientious or religious
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
exemptions they would simply do so and
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
say I have a I have a conscientious or
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
religious ex exemption or or qualm with
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
what is being proposed and at that point
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof would shift to the
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
person administering the exemption to
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
require a hefty burden of proof to
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
disprove that claim before they could
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
deny it but what I saw under Co and I
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
experienced this with close friends of
 
01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:19.639 align:start position:0%
mine as well was in some cases it was
 
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
flipped seemingly so that the burden of
 
01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:22.990 align:start position:0%
flipped seemingly so that the burden of
proof

01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
proof
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
was placed on the person requesting the
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
exemption to such an extent that they
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
would require letters written from their
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
pastors requiring specific scriptural
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
references to why this is not in line
 
01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:41.719 align:start position:0%
with your beliefs your sincerely held
 
01:54:43.629 --> 01:54:43.639 align:start position:0%
beliefs as well as requests for your own
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
medical history and if you had ever for
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
instance had a flu vaccine before you're
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
going to need to explain why this is now
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
different than that and the it's a
 
01:54:56.069 --> 01:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
really really extremely high burden of
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
proof was placed on some of the people
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
seeking exemptions rather than the other
 
01:55:02.589 --> 01:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
way around which seems like the more
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
thing if anybody knows anybody um that
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh has that background that could come
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
to the committee uh just please contact
 
01:55:21.629 --> 01:55:21.639 align:start position:0%
us and let us know and we'd be more than
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
willing um uh to hear from them um
 
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah there this is there's a lot um
 
01:55:35.550 --> 01:55:35.560 align:start position:0%
to go through here
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know as we put think about what
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing who we're going to be
 
01:55:45.069 --> 01:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
hearing from and of course we'd always
 
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
love to hear from the public um we're
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
also have to be thinking about how our
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
report's going to look and how we're
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
going to put together
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
that um so just want to throw
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
that representative Bel if I may if this
 
01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
is an appropriate time I'd like to offer
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
some some thoughts as to how I sort of
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
envisioned the uh the most sort of
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
possible ideal looking report um might
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
be might look um so I was thinking I
 
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
think the best way to start at this you
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
know the 30,000 foot view is to start by
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
breaking it down topically I think to do
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
it chronologically would be too
 
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
difficult to cause people to jump around
 
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:29.719 align:start position:0%
and try to find instances of their of
 
01:56:31.149 --> 01:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
whatever they're looking for in 10
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
different places rather than just one um
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then and then within the broader
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
topical breakdown I in order to maintain
 
01:56:43.149 --> 01:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
a uniformity between each section I
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
think we should have uh the same sort of
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
um chapters or whatever you might want
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
to call them within each topic and I
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
think those should include uh testimony
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
received which will not be comprehensive
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
but it will pull out selected testimony
 
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
that is impactful and and pertinent to
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and say this is what
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
we've received this is what we've been
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
told by members of the public and
 
01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
experts um a section in under each topic
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
for um any persons who have made
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
allegations or grievances for us to
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
examine um incentive mechanisms that may
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
have been established by any uh by
 
01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:22.950 align:start position:0%
have been established by any uh by
anyone

01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%

01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
facts which will probably be one of the
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
shorter ones because it's actually going
 
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
to be hard to fully establish um what is
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
uncontroverted fact versus mere um

Envision that more like a a an
 
01:58:13.629 --> 01:58:13.639 align:start position:0%
intelligence type breakdown where we can
 
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
attribute a medium low or high degree of
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
confidence in in various items that
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
areas for further
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
investigation and by whom should that be
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
conducted um recommendations and avenues
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
for redress of
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
grievance uh recommendations for
 
01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.350 align:start position:0%
grievance uh recommendations for
legislative

01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
action and recommendations for future
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
emergent events such as other pandemics
 
01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
and of course I think all of this should
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
include um positive Lessons Learned as
 
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
well things that we might have done well
 
01:58:54.189 --> 01:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
compared to to other states other
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
nations um as well as the uh of course
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
received I thank you for uh putting uh
 
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
that together and being very thoughtful
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
on that I think it's important that we
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
highlight the positives um but I also
 
01:59:19.069 --> 01:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
think it's important uh that as we look
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
to the Future and just in hearing from
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
Dr pull off with the Infectious Disease
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
doctor that when we look at an another
 
01:59:29.709 --> 01:59:29.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic or something coming down the
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
pike that we really need to look at you
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
know Break It Out by uh demographics or
 
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
age groups or who's the most affected
 
01:59:44.669 --> 01:59:44.679 align:start position:0%
and relo protocols accordingly um as we
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
learned um because I really truly
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
believe that the mental health of the
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
public should should be at the
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
Forefront uh of the mental health of the
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
individual I should say should be at the
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
Forefront of everything that we do
 
02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:03.310 align:start position:0%
Forefront of everything that we do
um

02:00:03.310 --> 02:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
because I have a saying that attitude is
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
basically most of everything um and
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
keeping positive and knowing that we're
 
02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:15.830 align:start position:0%
going to get through things
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:16.950 align:start position:0%
going to get through things
[Music]

02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
um really has a lot to do with
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
health and
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to make sure that uh
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
when we roll something out or do
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
something in the
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
future we
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
also it shouldn't be all doom and gloom
 
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
we we really need to put in our that
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's there is a solution that there
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
is an answer that there is positivity
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
and I think positivity is something that
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
we really really need to
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
stress um because I don't think that was
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
done during the pandemic represent
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
leus there's a book that I read that
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
looks at survivors and they looked at a
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
plane crash in particular and those who
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
survived and those who did not even
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
though they might be sitting right next
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
to each other in the seats and they
 
02:01:14.430 --> 02:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
looked at the differences and they
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
looked at then other instances and they
 
02:01:23.069 --> 02:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
came up with a number of criteria
 
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
that helps with survival and perhaps
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
that's something we should look at and
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
think about for the future it's like how
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
did we or did we not do those things
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
because part of that is the attitude
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things like that
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
and for instance the whole
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering works to the opposite of
 
02:01:52.270 --> 02:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
survival and so perhaps that is
 
02:01:56.910 --> 02:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
we um push or promote the things that
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
work towards
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
survival and how much did we push or
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
promote the things that work against it
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
and what can we do in the future to work
 
02:02:09.199 --> 02:02:10.589 align:start position:0%
and what can we do in the future to work
towards

02:02:10.589 --> 02:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
towards
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
survival representative Belcher thank
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and and and to go into
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
that same the same topic and mental
 
02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
health obviously being a very important
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
topic um I know myself and perhaps
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
mothers here have just recently finished
 
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
a book by Abigail shrier called bad
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
therapy going over some of the really
 
02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.470 align:start position:0%
therapy going over some of the really
detailed

02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
detailed
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
analysis and uh speaking with experts
 
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
and interviews as
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
to sort of the nature of our therapeutic
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
environment that we find ourselves in
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
and um one of the things that really
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
stood out to me in that book was that
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
resilience is the default human
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
position um absent any other you know
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
intervening things people tend to be
 
02:02:56.430 --> 02:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
resilient and that can be demonstrated
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
based on look looking at things such as
 
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
the variable PTSD rates um in different
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
populations populations that are um
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
relatively you know well
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
off yet steeped in uh a therapeutic
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
environment actually find that they have
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
very much higher PTSD rates than
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
populations that have very diff ult
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
lives um but are not steeped in the
 
02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic environment and how
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
that direction may have played into our
 
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic response in a detrimental and
 
02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:41.069 align:start position:0%
pandemic response in a detrimental and
paradoxical

02:03:41.069 --> 02:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
way could you go into that just a little
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
bit further because if I heard you
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
correctly just want to make sure that
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
the people that had um more
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties and didn't have uh therapy
 
02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:57.910 align:start position:0%
difficulties and didn't have uh therapy
readily

02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
readily
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
available had less
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
PTSD than those that were more affluent
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
and had therapy readily available is
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
that correct kind of not not exactly but
 
02:04:10.549 --> 02:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
kind of so it's not it's not exactly
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
therapy readily available it's more a
 
02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
matter of being steeped in a therapeutic
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
environment and and so let me expound on
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
that the idea of rumination the idea of
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
sitting with yourself in your thoughts
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
and thinking about yourself
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
and it's been said by some particularly
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
famous therapist that there is little
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
difference between sitting around
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
thinking of yourself and being depressed
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
it is I almost the same
 
02:04:32.719 --> 02:04:34.229 align:start position:0%
it is I almost the same
thing

02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
so those steeped in a culture of
 
02:04:43.069 --> 02:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
rumination and thinking about themselves
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
more tend to have worse mental health
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes and more
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
diagnoses than those in more difficult
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances who don't spend time
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
rumination ruminating uh another way to
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
look at it is your your mindset there's
 
02:05:00.189 --> 02:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
two primarily different mindsets you can
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
take toward the world one is a mindset
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
of self and one is a mindset of task the
 
02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
first mindset being you're you're
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
spending your time you're looking at
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
everything through a lens of how is this
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
affecting my mental health how am I
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
feeling about this the other mindset is
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
how do I get this task done and what you
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
find is that the more time you spend in
 
02:05:23.229 --> 02:05:23.239 align:start position:0%
mindset a thinking about
 
02:05:25.870 --> 02:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
self the worse mental health outcomes
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
you are and the less you were capable of
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
getting done in life which also affects
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
your mental health than somebody who is
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
Task oriented so it might be worth
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
exploring how we responded in terms of
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
mental health to this pandemic in terms
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
of did we promote rumination did we
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
promote this theraputic mindset of
 
02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
sitting with yourself and thinking about
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
yourself which is functionally no
 
02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
different than being depressed and how
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
did that impact US versus could we have
 
02:05:56.549 --> 02:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
directed people in a task oriented way
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
with goals where they might have
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
actually felt good about themselves and
 
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
brought people together instead of the
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
alternative representative leus just
 
02:06:11.549 --> 02:06:11.559 align:start position:0%
following on with that how much did the
 
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
lockdowns contribute to just sitting
 
02:06:17.229 --> 02:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
around looking at
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
yourself as opposed to being able to do
 
02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:26.030 align:start position:0%
yourself as opposed to being able to do
things

02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
off yeah to follow up on last two um for
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
me the focus is more like
 
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh like people need to information to
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
act upon like there was some active uh
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
measures like people were thinking how
 
02:06:52.549 --> 02:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
create more masks or like how to brw
 
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
their own uh hand sanitizer but for me
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
focus is more like instead of informing
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
people it was more like instilling fa
 
02:07:09.719 --> 02:07:11.030 align:start position:0%
people it was more like instilling fa
with

02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
constant daily daily press briefings but
 
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
also like focusing on number of people
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
who died and all the negatives that come
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
Vis it and it was always uh
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
some running line in the news uh and uh
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
more on federal level but on state level
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
it was similar so for
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
was of course there was place for ration
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
but there was a lot of fair fair
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
even even without termination
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
scared if anybody has anything else they
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
would like to say or discuss um I did
 
02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
have this continued for 1:00 I don't
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
know if we need
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
to uh do that
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
or um and I'm not sure what the protocol
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
is um where the meeting is
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
listed um represent
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
lus well when I talked earlier about
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
treatment protocols we then got off into
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions Etc but I still would
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
like to to
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
pursue medical protocols and the fact
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
that there were out there and
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
published um Medical protocols that were
 
02:08:55.950 --> 02:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
being um
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
successful and then the inability to
 
02:09:01.069 --> 02:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
follow those
 
02:09:01.079 --> 02:09:03.149 align:start position:0%
follow those
protocols

02:09:03.149 --> 02:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
and just basically where did that come
 
02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
from how to that H Etc is that something
 
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
you'd like to discuss this afternoon go
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
into depth more or no I would like to
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
have speaking of somebody to come in and
 
02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
talk to us you know we read all those
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
things things of course they kept being
 
02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:26.149 align:start position:0%
things things of course they kept being
um

02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:28.830 --> 02:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
say so so it would be nice if we could
 
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
get someone uh from the hospital
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
Association in here and I will see what
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%

just about everything that I wanted to
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
get into here today there's one final
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
thing I'd like to do with permission to
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
make an appeal to the public um
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
regarding our uh regarding
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
advertisements now we we seek to get to
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
the B botom of issues regarding what
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
guidance was issued as well as different

guidance or protocols or anything of
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
that nature Made by the state of New
