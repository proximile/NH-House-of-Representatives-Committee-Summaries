00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
right so next slide this slide talks
 
00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:03.919 align:start position:0%
about just
 
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
all the populations really that have a
 
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
connection here to the hospital so
 
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
although new hampshire hospital serves a
 
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
finite number of individuals
 
00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
the impact that we have on towns
 
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
communities businesses and health
 
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.790 align:start position:0%
communities businesses and health
systems

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i have a question back on that slide
 
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
too sorry
 
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's okay i hope i hope miss rounds
 
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
warned you i tend to do this but
 
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
okay so as your circle uh is outside
 
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:36.950 align:start position:0%
okay so as your circle uh is outside
there

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't i'm not actually seeing
 
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms
 
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason that is relevant as you
 
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
know historically
 
00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
we i think there's a better word than
 
00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.350 align:start position:0%
we i think there's a better word than
warehousing

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
warehousing
 
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
but for a few years we were warehousing
 
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.790 align:start position:0%
but for a few years we were warehousing
uh

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
people that needed inpatient care at the
 
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
in ers and we were using up a whole lot
 
00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh capacity sometimes a third of their
 
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
emergency room capacity
 
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
so so it seems to me like that's one of
 
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
our key populations that we serve
 
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
are the state's emergency rooms and i'm
 
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
how we're doing these days on allowing
 
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
the flow of patients from ers into
 
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital or is there a
 
00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
slide on that or is this the right slide
 
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
to talk about that
 
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
that there is more detail later i i
 
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
would agree with you that you know under
 
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.310 align:start position:0%
would agree with you that you know under
the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
that circle of hospitals um more
 
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.230 align:start position:0%
that circle of hospitals um more
specifically

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
a direct impact is on the emergency
 
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.910 align:start position:0%
a direct impact is on the emergency
department

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
and yes we we have more detail later in
 
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
the presentation about referrals
 
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
about waitlist and and the issue of
 
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.590 align:start position:0%
about waitlist and and the issue of
boarding

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
boarding
 
00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 align:start position:0%
so this slide just talks about what the
 
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
scope of service is here at new
 
00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and what we do
 
00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
and what we don't do at this point we've
 
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about
 
00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
what what the hospital does but we want
 
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
to be clear about what we don't do
 
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire hospital does not
 
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 align:start position:0%
provide substance use treatment unless
 
00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 align:start position:0%
it's secondary to a serious mental
 
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
illness so for a patient to be here at
 
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder cannot be the
 
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.830 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder cannot be the
primary

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis we do
 
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
not have our own in-house diagnostic
 
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
services such as pathology or radiology
 
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't provide any outpatient
 
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
service to the community
 
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
the slide just shows our our team our
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire hospital
 
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
state employee team just to give you
 
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
some context on on
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know who's working here at the
 
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
hospital and also their years of service
 
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
i think what's great about
 
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
the team is that we really have
 
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.790 align:start position:0%
the team is that we really have
representation

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
um among definitely different skill sets
 
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
some of our leaders have been here for
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know well you can see rosie costanzo
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
our chief nursing officer 33 years
 
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
cindy pomonas 20 years beth nagi 22
 
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then um there are folks like myself
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
joe christie ellen lapointe
 
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 align:start position:0%
who are newer to state service but have
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
worked in the private sector
 
00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
and and bring that skill set so i think
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a great combination
 
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
so moving on to key performance
 
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.390 align:start position:0%
so moving on to key performance
indicators

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
over the past few years the hospitals
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
made a concerted effort to design our
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
strategic plan around the needs of
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
citizens across new hampshire
 
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
we've come to find that these needs
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
translate into five objectives for our
 
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.350 align:start position:0%
translate into five objectives for our
organization

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
delivering high quality care creating
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
timely access to care
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
maintaining fiscal stewardship providing
 
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
an exceptional patient experience
 
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
and improving employee well-being
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
from those objectives we have numerous
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
metrics but in being 100
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
transparent the hospital's collective
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
effort primarily focuses
 
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
on just one of these strategic
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
imperatives and that's creating timely
 
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
imperatives and that's creating timely
access

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
to care or reducing the emergency room
 
00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.589 align:start position:0%
to care or reducing the emergency room
boarding

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
boarding
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
which i think was what you were
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
this slide refers to referrals over time
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
through the years and you can see that
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's remained relatively flat
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
but although referrals remain relatively
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
flat the wait list
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
continues to grow particularly over the
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
past year
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
likewise as the waitlist grows the
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
problem of emergency room boarding grows
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
there a separate slide on the
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
to summarize the boarding problem is it
 
00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.310 align:start position:0%
to summarize the boarding problem is it
is

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
is this it this is part of it yep we'll
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
get into children as well
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
in more detail so
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
just to make sure i'm reading this right
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
in 2012 we
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
we hit 1913
 
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh adult patients who were
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
in emergency rooms that had been
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
identified as needing
 
00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 align:start position:0%
admission to the new career hospital
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's by days so that represents the
 
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
patient but also the number of days that
 
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
they were waiting
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
one guy for a week that would be seven
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
1913. you got it yep
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative walter has a question i
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
think you just answered i
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize that was days and i
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to know what the
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
average what the average number of
 
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.749 align:start position:0%
average what the average number of
people

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
in um emergency rooms
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
by day was i might have that on another
 
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.830 align:start position:0%
by day was i might have that on another
slide

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
if it's okay i'll keep going and if i
 
00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.270 align:start position:0%
if it's okay i'll keep going and if i
don't

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i still find your
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative are you
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up would you like
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
to keep talking that's okay
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
yeah no i just have one more question i
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
want she may have the
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
information just what is the average
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
stay in the emergency room do you have
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
that how long do people wait in the
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
emergency room
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
we can get that for you i know we have
 
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.510 align:start position:0%
we can get that for you i know we have
that

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
i'm just making a note i'll get that
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
that would be actually kind of a cool
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
thing to do with this slide is to use
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
the right
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
side of it as the average uh length of
 
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.589 align:start position:0%
side of it as the average uh length of
uh

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
boarding you know so that we could see
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
it overall but
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm a little disappointed in this
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
slide because i had heard
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that we had solved this
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
problem in the last
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
budget and i don't consider 1400
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
patient days to be solved what's it
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
going to take
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
to bend this curve down in an aggressive
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate manner
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i think
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
this is a great slide because it does
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
show the progress that we made between
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh 2017 right up um
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
to 2020 and you see that
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
significant dip in march of 2020
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
so over time we were and and we'll get
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
the information about the average
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
number of days waiting but i can tell
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
you that that had been trending down
 
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.070 align:start position:0%
you that that had been trending down
significantly

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
over these period of years since 2017.
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
what you see on this slide is during the
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
period of time between 2019 and 2020 we
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
developed the contract with hampstead
 
00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.629 align:start position:0%
developed the contract with hampstead
hospital

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
we started transitioning
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
children services to them beginning in
 
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.749 align:start position:0%
children services to them beginning in
january

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
january
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
and then we escalated that in march due
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
we had been having kids admitted there
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
by attrition
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
but because of the emergency really
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
within the pandemic in march
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
we um aggressively approached that and
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
worked with hampstead to transfer kids
 
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.029 align:start position:0%
worked with hampstead to transfer kids
over

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
so there was a period of days in march
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
where we had no wait list
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
we opened up adult beds we increased
 
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.990 align:start position:0%
we opened up adult beds we increased
access

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then you see the number going up
 
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.430 align:start position:0%
and then you see the number going up
again

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
over the summer and that really is
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
representative of you know once we
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
filled those beds
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
having an issue with discharge following
 
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.509 align:start position:0%
having an issue with discharge following
that

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
um especially for elders because
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
you know i think as you know during the
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic many if not all of the nursing
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
homes were closed to admissions
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
at certain points of time including
 
00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
at certain points of time including
glencliff

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
glencliff
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
so there was the elders that we had
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
difficulty with discharging
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
but it was also during that period of
 
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.590 align:start position:0%
but it was also during that period of
time

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
that community resources were limited uh
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic as well
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
so i think really you you know you can
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
see the
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the dip in the number again
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
of increasing number of beds but this
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
climb represents the back
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
and we're disappointed too it was you
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
know one of my happiest days
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
um that day in march where we had um no
 
00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:46.070 align:start position:0%
um that day in march where we had um no
one

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
and it just has crept up since then i
 
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.990 align:start position:0%
and it just has crept up since then i
appreciate

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
that you're a mid-section of the
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
pipeline that you have
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
input issues into the pipeline and you
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
have output issues with that pipeline to
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
get people
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
into back into the communities so um
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
so this is not an easy problem this is
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
an entire statewide systemic
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
problem um and i just i just hope
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
the smart people are continuing to look
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
at this to figure out
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
how how we're going to free up our
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms emergency
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
rooms have a purpose and it's not to
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
take care of boarding the those with
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
issues so thank you and
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
i think what's most important for your
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee to know
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
is that you know with everything else
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
that we do at the hospital
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
this is our number one priority this is
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
it this is what we work
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
on every single day trying to increase
 
00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:43.350 align:start position:0%
on every single day trying to increase
access

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't see any other
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
questions you can continue
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay um so
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
this next slide talks about new
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital census trends over
 
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.829 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital census trends over
time

00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
i think this also is a great slide
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
because it shows our efforts
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
in increasing just access
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
for patients in the ed so all of this
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
growth in emergency room boarding is
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
despite the hospital's effort
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
to increase our capacity the hospital
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
did have an interruption in capacity due
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
to kova 19 quarantining protocols
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
but we've since then brought capacity
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
back up to 100
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
and we're operating with a census of 172
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
to 175 patients
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
on any given day so looking back in july
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
of 2019 you can see
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
average census was around 154 so we've
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
really increased
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
um increased bed numbers
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
by 20 essentially and that directly
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
correlates with the hampstead contract
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
the dip that you see here in the fall
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
that was when we had our first
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
cases a patient cases here at the
 
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
cases a patient cases here at the
hospital

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
of coven 19 and then we had to implement
 
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.750 align:start position:0%
of coven 19 and then we had to implement
some

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
quarantine and isolation procedures so
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
although 163 is the last number that's
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
shown here on the slide
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're at 175 today and pretty much every
 
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.389 align:start position:0%
we're at 175 today and pretty much every
day

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
if we have a fluctuation of one or two
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's really just due to patients being
 
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
it's really just due to patients being
maybe

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
um evaluated in the emergency room for a
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
medical issue
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
but other than that we are maintaining
 
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.629 align:start position:0%
but other than that we are maintaining
100

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
all the time so do you have
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
um a supply of vaccine a covet vaccine
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
that you can use on your patients
 
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
that you can use on your patients
regardless

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
of their other comorbidities and age so
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
that you're dealing with a vaccinated
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
inpatient population thank you for that
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
question we
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
have been able to access vaccine for our
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
patients that
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
meet the requirement under 1b um
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
so we have not yet gotten uh vaccine to
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinate 100
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
of our patients but we have received it
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
for those that qualify under 1b so in
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
particular our elders
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
so anyone over 65 on our elder care unit
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
but we do also have a number of patients
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
um just by the nature of their severe
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
mental illness who also have
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
a number of other medical conditions so
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
we started vaccinating patients
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago and we continue receiving
 
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.710 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago and we continue receiving
vaccine

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
and and administering those in weekly
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
clinics on our units
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay not being a clinician i would just
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
think that it would
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
be beneficial if you could just 100
 
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
be beneficial if you could just 100
vaccinate

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinate
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
new uh new admissions just
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
because this is probably a more physical
 
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.189 align:start position:0%
because this is probably a more physical
group

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
of patients than other hospitals have
 
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
of patients than other hospitals have
and

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
that close interaction it would be nice
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
just to get that extra layer of
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
protection for your
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
employees i agree 100
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
and i think that as more vaccine is
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
received here in the state i anticipate
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
that we'll get there um and and
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
you're so right you know for our
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
patients in particular our our patients
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
you know struggling with homelessness um
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're really at risk
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
um so definitely whatever vaccine we can
 
00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
um so definitely whatever vaccine we can
get

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
we will administer all right
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative wallner has a
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
question there yes
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you so
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
recently i thought i had understood
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
that ten of the adult beds at new
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
had been converted once again to
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
beds for children so
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if one if that is if that
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
and if it is correct um
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
where did what did we what did we
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
provide for the 10
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
are those is that just 10 more adults
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
who now are in the emergency rooms
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
how is that working
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
so yes the way that that's working is we
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
are temporarily accepting children again
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
and we anticipate that it will be
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
short-term really
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
um into the spring around may
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
child weightless numbers had grown so
 
00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:16.790 align:start position:0%
child weightless numbers had grown so
dramatically

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
that it was it was just not sustainable
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
the number of kids
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
at a certain point there were 50
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
children waiting in the ed
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
it was more than adults um so the the
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
quickest thing that we could do
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
um and it's not the long-term solution
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
by any means but the quickest thing we
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
could do
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
was um open up a kid unit again here at
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
so um the day that we made that decision
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
we were again at 100 occupancy actually
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
we were over 100
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
i think our census was 177 um the day
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
that we decided to open up the
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
children's unit
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
we did have to temporarily stop adult
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
admissions during that time
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
needed to work through some discharges
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
we are our census is 165 adults
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
and 10 children we're accepting adult
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
admissions again
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
but you are correct you know 10 of those
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
beds are
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
offline for adults so we have seen a
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
slight increase
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
in adults waiting in the ed as we work
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
but um it is it is planned to be
 
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:24.470 align:start position:0%
but um it is it is planned to be
temporary

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
um and in the meantime my understanding
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
is um that the department
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh works closely with other drfs and
 
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.310 align:start position:0%
uh works closely with other drfs and
hospitals

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
to ask them to to really take part in
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
increasing access to adults during this
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
time period so that we could try to
 
00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:40.550 align:start position:0%
time period so that we could try to
minimize

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
minimize
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
um any negative effects on the adult
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you you have a follow-up
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
your hands up still
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry no that's that answers my
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay so i think what i heard in there
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
but just to make it explicit
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
is that you all have prioritized
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
getting kids out of the ers
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
more quickly than the adults and that
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's an active prioritization effort
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
it was um that is that is correct and
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see in future slides that what's
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
different about children during this
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
time period
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
is that although adult referrals had
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
been fairly
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
steady what we've seen during the
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic is that children's referrals
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
so i think this slide is a good summary
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the situation for adults in referrals
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
so again key takeaways adult referrals
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
have been steady
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
the waitlist has grown
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
not only new hampshire hospital but also
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
the drfs and hot in
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the other in private hospitals um
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
impacted by covet 19. so um at the same
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
time during this pandemic that we have
 
00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
time during this pandemic that we have
had

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
periods of time where we had to initiate
 
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.470 align:start position:0%
periods of time where we had to initiate
quarantine

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
quarantine
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
and reduce access the same thing has
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
been happening in hospitals
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
they've had some clusters of illness as
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
at this point it doesn't seem like it's
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
made a significant impact on the wait
 
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.390 align:start position:0%
made a significant impact on the wait
list

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
but the wait list has been growing
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
really steadily over time
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
so you see some spikes with those
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
quarantine time periods
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
but that's not really the primary reason
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the wait list i think
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
as you said chairman edwards this is
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
problem we've been struggling with for a
 
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.150 align:start position:0%
problem we've been struggling with for a
while

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
on any given day this is really
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
important the fifth bullet point
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
at least half of the patients at new
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital could be better
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
served in a less restrictive environment
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
so so i don't want to start a long
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
conversation here i just want to do a
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
checkpoint with you
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
has has anyone ever taken a look
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
at a partnership between the sununu
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
youth center and the new hampshire
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
hospital i understand there's
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of facility space over sununu
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's basically uh mothballed
 
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.990 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's basically uh mothballed
um

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
kind of a yes or no have people
 
00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:29.350 align:start position:0%
kind of a yes or no have people
investigated

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of using some of that
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
moth bald space it's the sununu center
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
my and i haven't personally done that in
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
investigation or research but my
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the department has
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that it was not found um realistic
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
um to utilize for um for inpatient care
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding could you give
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
me the bullet points of the summary
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
of that that feasibility look yeah
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
i don't get that not being formal but i
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
just would like to know the bullet
 
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.110 align:start position:0%
just would like to know the bullet
points

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
points
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
sure representative has a question
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
on bullet number five what
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
what alternative what kind of um
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
less restrictive environment have we
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
worked towards during this past couple
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
of years
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think there did we remove
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
some did we do some work at the
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
philbrook center
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
and move some people from new hampshire
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
hospital over to philbrook
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
and what other kinds of work have we
 
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.470 align:start position:0%
and what other kinds of work have we
done

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
to provide some
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
less restrictive environments yes we did
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
we we opened up a transitional housing
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
program over at philbrook
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's 16 beds so that was a project
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
that we worked on through the summer
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
and we opened that in september um and
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
that program and you'll we'll we'll get
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
into detail of the program and another
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
slide deck but
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's been very successful in helping
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
us transition patients out of the
 
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
us transition patients out of the
hospital

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
while they're looking for housing
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
another area
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
that we need more help with
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
is just supported
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
housing in the community along the lines
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
of what nfi does
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
so nfi provides a great deal of
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
structure and
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know in addition to the housing and
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
they have robust programming
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
they have an extensive wait list to get
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
into nfi so we struggle with the nfi
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
wait list
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
for elders people who may need assisted
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
living level of care
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
or a nursing home level of care that has
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
also been a significant challenge that
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've been working on
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
um you'll hear more about that with the
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
glencliff presentation but the other
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
thing that we've been doing
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
is um doing outreach to nursing homes to
 
00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:54.950 align:start position:0%
is um doing outreach to nursing homes to
see

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
if they would um you know become a
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
partner to us
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
um in in working with patients
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
considering patients
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
who have psychiatric illness that have
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
been stabilized at new hampshire
 
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.310 align:start position:0%
been stabilized at new hampshire
hospital

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
so that's ongoing work that's happening
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
um to try to
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
make a more robust system for for these
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
folks in the community
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
so those are the different pieces we've
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
been trying to target and you'll hear
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
more about that
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
um when um behavioral health does their
 
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
um when um behavioral health does their
presentation

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
for you i think maybe this afternoon or
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
or tomorrow
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's they have a lot of programming
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
that they're working on as well
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
right yes one follow-up
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the bud the budget that we're looking
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
at the governor's proposed budget
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
is there funding in here for additional
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
um less restrictive
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
housing for for mental health
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
patients yes
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes there is and there are rfps that the
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
department is pursuing even now
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um this is just a
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
question we got the briefing book
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
from the department so thank you karen
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
um i was just wondering if um heather
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
wanted to call our attention to anything
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
that's in the briefing book
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
were there any pages i think that the
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
department starts on page 165 and i
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
didn't know if there were
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
any details in the briefing book that
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
you would like
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
us to be sure to notice thanks
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to ask him we're asking a
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
broader question representative nordgren
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
i want to check in with mr ripple on
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
we we have prior to the briefing book
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
been of being available we've gone
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
through the slide deck and then we've
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
gone into the excel sheet
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
the briefing book adds another potential
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
source of
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
input how should we do that should we be
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
asking the presenters to hit the
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
briefing book
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
ideas as they go through the powerpoint
 
00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:11.269 align:start position:0%
ideas as they go through the powerpoint
or

00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
is that a separate conversation
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh it has been done that way in past
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
years they've gone through the
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
presentations and then
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
the briefing book and then the actual
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
accounts i'm not sure if they're
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
prepared to do that this time or not
 
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.350 align:start position:0%
prepared to do that this time or not
though

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put miss milkween on the
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
spot here
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh are you up on what's in the briefing
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
book are you ready to talk about that
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
after you get through your slide deck
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes i i think that was our plan was to
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
go through the slide deck and then i'm
 
00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:42.070 align:start position:0%
go through the slide deck and then i'm
gonna

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
pass it over to um joe christie our cfo
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
to get into more
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
detail in the book if that's okay
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
let me check representative is that
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
acceptable to you
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
okay other questions keep going oh nfi
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
you have to be careful with the acronyms
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
nfi what is that
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
oh gosh you're putting me on the spot
 
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
oh gosh you're putting me on the spot
nfi

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
nfi
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
i don't remember what that stands for
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but they have a number of
 
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.710 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but they have a number of
contracted

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
centers where they provide the
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
transitional housing so there
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
is concord i think is the biggest
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
program um so the concord program but
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of other locations in the state
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
you helped me by making it so i don't
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
i will look it up though i should know
 
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:48.230 align:start position:0%
i will look it up though i should know
that

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
so sort of the segue here um into the
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
question around adults versus children
 
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.269 align:start position:0%
question around adults versus children
so

00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
this slide shows the dramatic increase
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
they have steadily increased through the
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
summer and the fall
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
and what's important to know and it you
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
know it's here in the bullet but
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take a significant increase
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
in referrals to result in ed boarding
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
um you know the over time
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
and we sort of touched on it when we
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about days waiting versus
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
number of individuals it doesn't take
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
that much of an increase to really
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
high referral volumes in subsequent
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
months can cause
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
significant capacity restraints this is
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
further exacerbated in facilities that
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
are struggling to discharge during the
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
covet 19 pandemic
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
this this has come up in particular at
 
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.710 align:start position:0%
this this has come up in particular at
hampstead

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
hampstead
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
with the discharge issue during the
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic so
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
um for children that are discharging
 
00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:54.630 align:start position:0%
um for children that are discharging
home

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
not a problem but for children who are
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
um in placement and residential
 
00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:00.950 align:start position:0%
um in placement and residential
placement

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
placement
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
in particular if they are
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
had an out-of-state placement planned or
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
was current
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
um there have been a lot of restrictions
 
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:11.990 align:start position:0%
um there have been a lot of restrictions
around

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
kids moving around during the pandemic
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
so in particular
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
vermont and maine um have had some
 
00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
vermont and maine um have had some
pretty

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know serious you know restrictions
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
on on children crossing the border
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
so placement has been difficult even in
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
um in state residential placement has
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
been challenging during
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
um the pandemic and they've had some
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
significant restrictions as well
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
so this has led kids to be waiting
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
longer to discharge so again
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
back door issue for hampstead um it that
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's what this
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
is um for kids waiting for placement
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
so representative nordron has a question
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um i don't know
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
where to ask this question
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
um but we did fund mobile units
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
for psychiatry um in the last budget and
 
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.430 align:start position:0%
for psychiatry um in the last budget and
i

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know kevin maybe can tell us
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
if those are still in or where they went
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
or what department would they would be
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where they ended up or what
 
00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:12.789 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where they ended up or what
happened

00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
or if they even were used by the
 
00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:16.549 align:start position:0%
or if they even were used by the
department

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:19.590 align:start position:0%
department
thanks

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if the funds were spent on
 
00:28:22.399 --> 00:28:23.029 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if the funds were spent on
those

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis units or not um
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
i believe they would be in they would be
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
in either behavioral health or
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health most likely
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they were budgeted
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget or not but
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's something we can get to when we
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
get to those presentations
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
so this slide shows the the child wait
 
00:28:54.159 --> 00:28:55.750 align:start position:0%
so this slide shows the the child wait
list

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
and again as referrals have increased so
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
has the wait list
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
and again as a result new hampshire
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
hospital is currently admitting children
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
here as well as adults we anticipate
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
but you can see i mean these really are
 
00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:13.269 align:start position:0%
but you can see i mean these really are
unprecedented

00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of children waiting the other
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
thing i want to mention
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
um is really for for kids
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is really um the impact you know of
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
isolation the pandemic
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
different school systems you know it's
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
really incredible to look at and over
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
time we've had
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
um seasonality to referrals so um
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
you know here when we used to take care
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
of kids here and also at hampstead
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
typically during the summer summer
 
00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:47.269 align:start position:0%
typically during the summer summer
vacation

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
referrals would just drop off that you
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
know very few kids getting referred
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
same thing during the holidays or during
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
school vacations we would see a drop
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
that hasn't happened at all this year
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
predicting this other than to say we see
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
it go up and up and up
 
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
with referrals so um
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's important for us to
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledge this
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
and um i i know certainly throughout the
 
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
and um i i know certainly throughout the
department

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
and and in you know children's
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
what we're really thinking about and
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
considering is you know this is where we
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
are now but we're not out of this yet
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
and and what what will the long-term
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
effects be
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
um over time um for children and adults
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think we really know that yet
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
um but you can see it's it's an area
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's very stressed
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
so so where are these kids physically
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
are they
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
are they um the ones that are in the
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
wait list are they back home
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
getting some wrap around services with
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
their parents or parent
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
or they sitting in an emergency room
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
hallway somewhere where
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
where are they physically mostly they're
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
um but we have been working with um
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health to have
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
some kids go home
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
with increased services and wrap around
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
sort of crisis
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
care in the home that work is ongoing
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
increasing you'll i'm sure you'll hear
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
more about that in future presentations
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
for some of the kids though they are
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
waiting at home
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
to return for an evaluation at hampstead
 
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.029 align:start position:0%
to return for an evaluation at hampstead
hospital

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
again i'm not a clinician but i just
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that to be good for kids i
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
i just gotta think they'd be better off
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
with all of their problems at home
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
than those same problems sitting in a
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
hallway in an emergency room so
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
i i i see mr norton's on the line i
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
i maybe uh he can tell us later what he
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
thinks but
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
hey uh representative wallner has a
 
00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:55.509 align:start position:0%
hey uh representative wallner has a
question

00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i guess i'm just having a
 
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.269 align:start position:0%
thank you i guess i'm just having a
little

00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
trouble with understanding this slide i
 
00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:02.549 align:start position:0%
trouble with understanding this slide i
see

00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
in at least sometimes i can't quite read
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
um in october it went up to 37
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
children in the wait list and then what
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
was this huge
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
dip down here in december
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
and then it got back up yeah
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
so through the fall um hampstead was
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
working to increase beds
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
so they were hiring actively hiring and
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
bringing more beds online
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that um that's what you see
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
during that time period they were able
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
to increase
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
admissions and actually i think we show
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
that in a future slide that they have
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
increased um
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
access a number of beds as well as
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
they've increased admissions just period
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
then at that point in december where you
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
you know sort of that off there and then
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
that dramatic climb up
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
um at that point they were full and and
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's sort of this repeating pattern that
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
you see here here at new hampshire
 
00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:05.269 align:start position:0%
you see here here at new hampshire
hospital

00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
we put beds online we fill them and then
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
we have trouble discharging
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
and i think that's represented in this
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
slide as well as just the ongoing
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
thank you could have one follow-up yes
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
so does hampstead have the ability now
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
um at this point there are seven beds
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
um that are physically present at
 
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.750 align:start position:0%
um that are physically present at
hampstead

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
hampstead
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
but not staffed so that's where we were
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
talking about we think that
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
in may new hampshire hospital will be
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
able to step out of that because they
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
have a provider returning from a
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
maternity leave
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
in may so that will open up an
 
00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:51.990 align:start position:0%
in may so that will open up an
additional

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
seven beds the other thing that is
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's fluid
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know as far as occupancy goes and
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
for children um is that for kids
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
some kids can't be in a shared room or a
 
00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.270 align:start position:0%
some kids can't be in a shared room or a
semi-private

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
semi-private
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
so for a number of reasons so that can
 
00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:14.869 align:start position:0%
so for a number of reasons so that can
impact

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
hampstead's ability to admit they do
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
have a number
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
not all their rooms are are private many
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
of them are semi-privates
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
um so that is also just related to
 
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.669 align:start position:0%
um so that is also just related to
acuity

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
acuity
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's some of um another thing that
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
they struggle with
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
for keeping kids safe but um and it's
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
another reason that some kids wait
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
a little bit longer in the e.d because
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
they specifically need a private room
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you sure and then representative
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
you've earned you've earned the right to
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
just ask your questions without
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
having to ask for a follow-up i i won't
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
i won't stop you unless
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
it's gone too far but i don't think
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
you'll do that so
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
just you're welcome to have a natural
 
00:34:58.079 --> 00:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
just you're welcome to have a natural
conversation

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
so this is the slide that shows um their
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
total number of admissions
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
so um they you can see they started
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
increasing actually back in july of 2019
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
you see the point in february where we
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
you see the increase there to 108
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
in march when we rapidly you know
 
00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:30.150 align:start position:0%
in march when we rapidly you know
started

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
utilizing the contract the drop-off that
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
you see in admissions there
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
i think that that represents that
 
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.589 align:start position:0%
i think that that represents that
initial

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
lull in referrals and i i think
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
maybe you all remember at the beginning
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
of it seems like forever ago but a year
 
00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:48.310 align:start position:0%
of it seems like forever ago but a year
ago

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
when this all started people weren't
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
going to the ed at all
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
so we saw a big drop-off in referrals at
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
the very beginning of the pandemic
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
everybody sort of hunkered down
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
and stayed home we saw the same thing at
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital with adults
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
referrals dropped but then um then they
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
picked up
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
again to the current level that you see
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
represent walnut your hand is up is that
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
from the previous
 
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.670 align:start position:0%
from the previous
conversation

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay sorry
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
so you know in summary we do think that
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
hampstead has done a great job expanding
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
their capacity
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
so this is the summary just regarding
 
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.470 align:start position:0%
so this is the summary just regarding
children

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
again hampstead has steadily increased
 
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.750 align:start position:0%
again hampstead has steadily increased
capacity

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
but they've seen at the same time an
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
increase in demand
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
three of the past four months have had
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
higher referral rates than the preceding
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
spring or summer so comparing
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
year over year and hempstead is
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
accepting a comparable if not more
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
referrals than new hampshire hospital
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
ever did so that sort of speaks to
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the so this this last three bullets
 
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:05.910 align:start position:0%
um the so this this last three bullets
are

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
um sort of i already said this um so
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
this idea that some kids require the
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
single room so that can
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
impact capacity they're having trouble
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
with kids waiting longer for placement
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
and covet 19 and quarantine issues have
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
been difficult with staffing
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
as they have at new hampshire hospital
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
that seems much better
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
both here at new hampshire hospital and
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
so if i were helping write this slide i
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
would add another bullet
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
about kind of a unacceptable level
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
of pediatric wait list
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
hanging out in emergency rooms instead
 
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.349 align:start position:0%
hanging out in emergency rooms instead
of

00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
at home with wraparound services or an
 
00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:50.710 align:start position:0%
at home with wraparound services or an
admission

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
admission
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that's that's i think
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's a major part of the summary of
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
where we're at
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
and we need to focus on that it really
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
is and that's
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's the reason we we um
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
started bringing kids back here
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's just such a crisis and such an
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
so key accomplishments and challenges
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire hospital
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
we've had a busy year we've been working
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
on a lot
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
um in circling back to our strategic
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
planning and metrics
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
we've been able to accomplish a slew of
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
targeted solutions to improve
 
00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.230 align:start position:0%
targeted solutions to improve
performance

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
performance
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
relative to our metrics we opened the
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
path center the philbrook adult
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
transitional housing center which we'll
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
discuss more in the next presentation
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
we executed the contract with hampstead
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
hospital for pediatric care
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
we've drastically improved our ability
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
to recruit and retain staff
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
we've increased census at new hampshire
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
hospital we've invested in crisis
 
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:53.829 align:start position:0%
hospital we've invested in crisis
prevention

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
training that has reduced employee
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
injuries and we've implemented a new
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
form of billing
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
for professional services that has
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
helped offset some revenue shortfalls
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
that came from contracting for pediatric
 
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:12.069 align:start position:0%
that came from contracting for pediatric
care

00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
oh i want to just highlight one other
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
thing that may be of interest
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
we did a staff vaccine
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
implementation that we started in
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
december and at this point
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
about 80 percent of our staff have
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
received both doses
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
of coven 19 vaccine that has
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
dramatically um
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
improved our staffing
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
reduced illness it's it's really been
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
amazing so i think that's that was a
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
huge accomplishment for us and
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
i'm really proud of our staff who um
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
were proactive and wanted to
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
receive vaccine 20
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
remaining are almost all of them people
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
who've refused the vaccine
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
yes we have had since we
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
did our program we have had a few people
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
change their mind about receiving
 
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.510 align:start position:0%
change their mind about receiving
vaccine

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
and we've helped them to register at a
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
fixed site
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
to get their vaccine and in addition to
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
that new staff
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're working that into our orientation
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
to help them
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
get their vaccine so i can i would
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate our numbers will increase
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
are you anticipating a need for
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
incentives to
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinate or coercion for to vaccinate
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
or are you going to
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
accept that some employees don't want
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccination
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think we will continue to educate and
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
i think that over time
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
as people see um co-workers receiving
 
00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
as people see um co-workers receiving
vaccine

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
and they receive more information about
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
how safe the vaccine is like i said we
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
continue to have people change their
 
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.589 align:start position:0%
continue to have people change their
mind

00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
and convert over so i don't think that
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
we will need to
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
there is a group of employees who just
 
00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:04.630 align:start position:0%
there is a group of employees who just
absolutely

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
are adamant that they will not be forced
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
um to receive a vaccine
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
and you know that's okay we we keep um
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
educating but they have very strong
 
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.349 align:start position:0%
educating but they have very strong
feelings

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
i'll say that thank you representative
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
you're not muted
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh okay thank you i appreciate the
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
answer i
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm anti-coercion
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
good um so these key accomplishments
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
um are here on the timeline that you see
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
in front of you
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
what we're most proud of is that we were
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
able to achieve
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
all of these accomplishments despite
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
having to react and respond to covet 19
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
and the numerous challenges that it
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
represented this is an absolute
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
testament to the dedication of our new
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital staff
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's been nothing short of humbling to
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
be part of this hospital during this
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just very proud of of all these
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing efforts
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
so in summary you see our key challenges
 
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.349 align:start position:0%
so in summary you see our key challenges
here

00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
front door for both adults and kids
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
backdoor and those details are listed
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
and then our operational and financial
 
00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.670 align:start position:0%
and then our operational and financial
challenges

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
um are listed here in regards to the
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
challenges the hospital has
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
there you know you you've seen that
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
those three categories
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
we everyone knows about the the
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
publicized challenge in the issue of
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
emergency room boarding of children and
 
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.870 align:start position:0%
emergency room boarding of children and
adults

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
and as you said chairman it's not a new
 
00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:44.790 align:start position:0%
and as you said chairman it's not a new
problem

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue with meeting
 
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:47.910 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue with meeting
demand

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
for years we continue to operate at full
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
capacity on a daily basis
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
through many conversations and analysis
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
of data we've come to realize that a
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
portion of our front door challenges
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
are actually caused by the backdoor
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
challenges that we've talked about
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2020 nearly half of the
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
patients at new hampshire hospital no
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
longer required acute inpatient care
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
but the community resources necessary to
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
safely discharge them
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
are limited as a result the hospital's
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
lack of ability to discharge contributes
 
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.270 align:start position:0%
lack of ability to discharge contributes
directly

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
to the front door issue of not being
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
able to admit
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
lastly the hospital faces numeral
 
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.069 align:start position:0%
lastly the hospital faces numeral
numerous

00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
numerous
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
operational challenges relative to
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
we have furniture that no longer meets
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
infection control standards
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
and an aging building that doesn't meet
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
new infection control standards
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
these are challenges we've been working
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
diligently on such as executing new
 
00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:42.710 align:start position:0%
diligently on such as executing new
contracts

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
to aid in staff recruitment and we're
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
currently underway with a four million
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
dollar renovation
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
that was approved as part of last
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
biennium's budget
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh question here is uh
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
do you do you already have um
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
an alternative process in place to where
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
front door admission requests are
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
evaluated to determine if they could
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
pass directly to go without coming
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
through the new hampshire hospital in
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
other words
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
that they they're they're awaiting
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
admission but maybe
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's possible to just bypass
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
admission and get them straight into the
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
back into the community
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question we do
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have what we call our admission
 
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.270 align:start position:0%
we have what we call our admission
huddle

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
huddle
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
and that happens at least twice a week
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
if not more and during that meeting we
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
have a group that includes
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
our medical director jeff fetter myself
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
social work our admission staff we go
 
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:46.630 align:start position:0%
social work our admission staff we go
through

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
every referral that's that has been
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
received here at the hospital and we
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
talk about alternatives could they go to
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
a drf
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
could they go to a voluntary unit um
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have jeff reach out and
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
speak with the clinician at the hospital
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
and make recommendations
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
um to initiate treatment and and maybe
 
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.230 align:start position:0%
um to initiate treatment and and maybe
avoid

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
the hospital visit um some of the
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
referrals that we have
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and these are folks that are boarding
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
our um
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder primarily and so
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know we review those cases and again
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
talk through with the hospital
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
what an appropriate referral would be
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
because you know um
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
for those folks it's it's not obviously
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for them to come here
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
um but you know based on sometimes
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
behavior or people being under the
 
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.069 align:start position:0%
behavior or people being under the
influence

00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
influence
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
we do get those referrals so yeah we try
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
to be really timely
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
and in making recommendations and
 
00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:40.069 align:start position:0%
and in making recommendations and
declining

00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
declining
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
admissions if it's appropriate
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
so this slide really talks about
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know how we um figure out care
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
basically um and and how to calculate
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
the work that we do
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
so while staffing specific benchmarks
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
and inpatient psychiatry
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
are really highly contextual we do
 
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:15.589 align:start position:0%
are really highly contextual we do
benchmarks

00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
benchmarks
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves on a cost per day which we
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
felt was
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
the best way to sort of show a good
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
metric in terms of our
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
cost effectiveness or stewardship
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
so that's what this shows i like this
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
slide a lot
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
um i just would ask is that
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
government-owned hospitals
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that government-owned psychiatric
 
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.309 align:start position:0%
is that government-owned psychiatric
hospitals

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
so if we were to fund you at the average
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
that would be a that would be lots of
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars wouldn't it
 
00:46:58.319 --> 00:47:03.270 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars wouldn't it
yes

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
i think this really shows how lean we
 
00:47:06.319 --> 00:47:07.270 align:start position:0%
i think this really shows how lean we
operate

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'd be curious and just a rough order of
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
magnitude estimate
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
of what additional incremental money
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be needed
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
just to bring you up to average from the
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
we can we can calculate that it doesn't
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
need to be hard math
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'll get back to you representative
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um did you
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
have did the governor's budget fund you
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
at the level you requested and if
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
so did you have other prioritized needs
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
either funded or not funded um
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
yes um that we were approved for what we
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
asked for and i'm i'll actually defer
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
to joe christie um to speak in more
 
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.109 align:start position:0%
to joe christie um to speak in more
detail

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
sure so um good morning everyone can you
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay um so yes um the budget that was
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
requested was funded
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
um when we go through the financials um
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh two things that we want to bring to
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
your attention today
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
one of them was kind of an item that
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
came up in
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
the final days if not i think the final
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
day of trying to finalize the budget so
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
it wasn't so much that it wasn't
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
um funded it just was one of those
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
things that was really hard to time
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
and get built into the governor's budget
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
so i will talk about that in a bit more
 
00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:37.829 align:start position:0%
so i will talk about that in a bit more
detail

00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes here but yes what was
 
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.630 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes here but yes what was
requested

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
so this next slide is um the slide that
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
talks about you know what if we got an
 
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.470 align:start position:0%
talks about you know what if we got an
increase

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
um 5 and what if there was a decrease
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
most importantly i think that the decr
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know five percent decrease
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
the number one thing you need to know is
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
that we would have to decrease capacity
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's the only way that we could manage
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
that would involve potentially layoffs
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
and hamper also hamper our ability to
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
meet regulatory standards we are joint
 
00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.190 align:start position:0%
meet regulatory standards we are joint
commission

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
um certified so that would be very
 
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.069 align:start position:0%
um certified so that would be very
difficult

00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
um if we got any problems do you have
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
any problems currently
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
do you have any problems currently with
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
your jc ah
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
certification no not currently we're
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
anticipating that they will come back
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
for our review
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
um sometime in the summer or fall it's
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
hard they
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
have gotten very much behind in their
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
survey and their their reviews because
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
but we are anticipating that they'll
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
and you can see on the slide you know
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
what could we do if we got an increase
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so it's not
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
good it's obviously not good to not
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
pass a jcho certification
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
but but what happens to you if you
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
do you lose federal money do you i mean
 
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.349 align:start position:0%
do you lose federal money do you i mean
what

00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm not encouraging it i'm just asking
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
what what's the worst case here
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
i i can jump in here a little bit
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
heather if you'd like
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
from a financial perspective cms does
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
stop paying all medicare claims i
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
believe they can also expand that to
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
include medicaid claims as well so
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's a significant financial impact
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
and then i believe they also just from a
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh oversight perspective can
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
pause things like admissions to the
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
hospital and so forth until
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
just to summarize i'm not encouraging it
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
so this next slide talks about our
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
staffing patterns
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
um number of positions and then the
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
percent of total positions
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think that um this is a great slide
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
because it really shows
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
how lean we function really you can see
 
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.069 align:start position:0%
how lean we function really you can see
that

00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
our direct care staff represent you know
 
00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.910 align:start position:0%
our direct care staff represent you know
73

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
73
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
of our budgeted positions so we have
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
very few administrative staff
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
um and then support services i think you
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
know is really
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
in in range of you know industry
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
standards if not a little low
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
um again we we get a lot done
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
with a little so
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have asked on
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
these questions what your
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate is that's a great question
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate for mental health workers
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
is around
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
22 23 vacancy rate for rns
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
is um substantially worse that is around
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
and you're trying to make that up with
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh per diems
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
and just uh overtime per diems
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
over time travel nurses when we can get
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
them but it's
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're in the same workforce struggle
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
um that many hospitals are in right now
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know with the nursing shortage
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
and the effects of covet 19 so it's very
 
00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:34.630 align:start position:0%
and the effects of covet 19 so it's very
difficult

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
you think you have very many support
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
services people who have been sucked
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
into doing administrative work instead
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
and just aren't listed as administrators
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
no i don't i don't think so i think um
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
and joe
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
jump in if i'm not correct but these
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
support services staff
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
represent materials management
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition environmental
 
00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.069 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition environmental
services

00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
facility staff so it's i don't think
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
um sort of overflow into admin
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
the the only thing i might add to that
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
um our our financial team so our revenue
 
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.790 align:start position:0%
um our our financial team so our revenue
cycle

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
and our accounting teams are included in
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
that support services
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
category you know one could argue that
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
those are a bit more administrative in
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
nature but
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
still required functions of the hospital
 
00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:25.829 align:start position:0%
still required functions of the hospital
nonetheless

00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
sure but your actual hands-on clinical
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
people are all in the acute phys
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
psychiatric services line and that's got
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
about a 30
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
so next up is the financial summary and
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
joe maybe you want to talk a little bit
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
about this slide
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
sure um so uh just to provide some
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
context on these
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh these these graphs in the 2018-2019
 
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.190 align:start position:0%
uh these these graphs in the 2018-2019
biennium

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
the hospital collected a portion of its
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
revenue called dish disproportionate
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
share payments um
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
we use an acronym called dish to refer
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
to those
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
the hospital received those dish funds
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
as federal
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
federal income and the dish fund program
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
is a program managed by cms
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
and it's really intended to reimburse
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire hospital is the largest
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
consumer of dish funds in the state
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
we have the most uncompensated care and
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
so in that in that biennium
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
those were logged as federal funds in
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
the 2020 2021 biennium
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
those funds were changed in how the
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
department managed them
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
so in in the 2018-19 biennium new
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital was
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
unique in how the state paid
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
its its dish funds to new hampshire
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
hospital versus how those funds were
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
paid out to every other hospital in the
 
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.309 align:start position:0%
paid out to every other hospital in the
state

00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 2021 biennium we made it the
 
00:54:59.839 --> 00:55:00.390 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 2021 biennium we made it the
same

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
so now every hospital in the state
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
receives their dish payments the same
 
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.630 align:start position:0%
receives their dish payments the same
way

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
and so that's really just resulted in
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
now medicaid
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
draws down the federal funds and then
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
they pay them as
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
other revenue to new hampshire hospital
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to highlight that
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
because it looks
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
like a very significant change in the
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
proportion of federal funding
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
between those two years but it's really
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
just a change
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
in uh definition almost so you'll see
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
that the general fund percentages remain
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
relatively the same
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
between those two years and then the
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
total of federal funds and other funds
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
from the 2018-2019 biennium
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
are pretty comparable to the total funds
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the 2020-2021 biennium
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
the federal funds in the 2020-21
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
biennium that are still there so that
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know the 3.8 million that was cares
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
act money that was paid directly to the
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
hospital so
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
these are not gopher funds these are
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
what are called provider relief funds
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
they were paid directly to every single
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
hospital through their billing
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
exchanges essentially and it's really
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
aimed at helping hospitals pay for pbe
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
helping them pay for costs associated
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
with screening services
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
testing services um treating individuals
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
with cova 19
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
buying new pieces of equipment or
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
improving their facility or their their
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
environment of care to meet a higher
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
level of infection control
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
and so that's what that little sliver of
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds is in the current biennium
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the sure
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
um are we going to have an opportunity
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
to use any
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
federal covert money for infection
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
control to replace some of that
 
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.870 align:start position:0%
control to replace some of that
furniture

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
furniture
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
that is a great question so we actually
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
have a couple of projects underway
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
and to answer your question yes we've
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
already replaced certain types of
 
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.630 align:start position:0%
already replaced certain types of
furniture

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
furniture
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
and bought certain pieces of equipment
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
as an example we bought a uv light
 
00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.270 align:start position:0%
as an example we bought a uv light
machine

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we can stick in a room and
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
essentially decontaminate a room
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
in a matter of minutes which has been
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
really helpful
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
but we also have two projects we're
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
working towards one is putting uv light
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
equipment in our air handler
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
system and then one is also working to
 
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:22.789 align:start position:0%
system and then one is also working to
remove

00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
fomite surfaces on units so that would
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
be things like carpet
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know anything that is not a
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
anything that is a permeable permeable
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
barrier i guess is a good way to phrase
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
we do intend on spending quite frankly a
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
majority of those funds on improving our
 
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
environment of care for
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
infection control standards okay try to
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
replace that furniture
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'm unmuted thank you mr chair there's a
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
sizable increase
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh for the next biennium in general
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
funds that we don't have
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's like 12 13 increase
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
why is it so sudden sure so the
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
the primary increases in uh general
 
00:58:13.599 --> 00:58:14.470 align:start position:0%
the primary increases in uh general
funding

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
um is relative to positions so a portion
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
is um wage increases that are scheduled
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh and then another portion of it is 30
 
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
new positions to help us increase census
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
on the former children's
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
unit so we have 30 new positions that we
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
created in this current year
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're actively recruiting to fill them
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
we requested
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
to have those converted into permanent
 
00:58:38.559 --> 00:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
to have those converted into permanent
positions

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming biennium i believe that
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
the governor included those conversions
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
in his version of the budget and so
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
those are the the primary drivers of
 
00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.190 align:start position:0%
those are the the primary drivers of
increasing

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh general funds um we did not ask for
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know more equipment money or or more
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
supply money
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
or facility type maintenance expenses
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
it really pertains to to staffing
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
well we're finding that throughout the
 
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:10.870 align:start position:0%
well we're finding that throughout the
hhs

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
and we just don't have the revenue to
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
sustain it
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
but what we're seeing is request thank
 
00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:17.990 align:start position:0%
but what we're seeing is request thank
you

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
so follow up i have on that is um
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the logic behind
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
creating new positions or converting
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
positions to
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
permanent if we have a 30 vacancy
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
in the clinical care area anyways i
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
if if you can't fill what we got what is
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
the point
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
of of adding more more
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh fte spaces if you can't hire the
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
faces to begin with
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a wonderful question
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
um we've
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
as heather has alluded to we've worked
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
really hard to try to increase our
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention practices
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
part of that were actually two items
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
that were approved in
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
it was either the the last gnc of
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
november the first gnc in december
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
relative to a wage enhancement for
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
mental health workers which i'm going
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
to talk about a little bit more in a few
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
slides here
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
but also some new ways of recruiting
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
staff so we've executed a
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
temporary to permanent staffing contract
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
with a staffing agency
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
so these individuals come to us on a
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
nine month temporary basis and after
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
which they would
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully assuming they do a
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
good job they would apply for one of our
 
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.230 align:start position:0%
good job they would apply for one of our
positions

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
and we would hire them into that that
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
contract has seen
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
a pretty remarkable success up to this
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
point so
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
um i believe we've hired 24 individuals
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
through that process since december
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's a great great leap for the
 
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.670 align:start position:0%
uh that's a great great leap for the
hospital

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
and we're going to continue trying to
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
find creative and alternative ways to
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
fill the positions so uh
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
i think your your point is certainly
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
spot on of
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know do you need to increase
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
positions if you can't fill the ones you
 
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.589 align:start position:0%
positions if you can't fill the ones you
have

01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
but i do think we have quite a few uh
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
efforts and plans in place to try to
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
fill the ones that we have
 
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we can fill the new
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay i'll take that uh it
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
represented nordgrid it looked like
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
maybe you were trying to raise your hand
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
no no i wasn't
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
okay i just didn't want to miss you all
 
01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:40.309 align:start position:0%
okay i just didn't want to miss you all
right

01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh so there are two uh specific uh
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh challenges that we wanted to bring to
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
your attention uh relative to the
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
hospital so the first
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
um is relative to those dish funds i
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned so again this is a
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
cms managed program to reimburse
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
in december of this past year
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
cms redefined the formula for
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
calculating uncompensated care
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
in a way that will most likely
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the hospital's
 
01:02:06.079 --> 01:02:07.829 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the hospital's
revenues

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the the new calculation
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
essentially excludes a
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh population of data that we were
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
previously including
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh so there's no issue with prior years
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
we've confirmed that issue
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
but we have some pretty significant and
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
complex outstanding questions
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
that we're seeking cms technical
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
guidance on
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the answer to those
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
questions this could be a
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
you know a a couple million dollar
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
revenue change
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
or a much higher uh revenue change so
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to point this out and
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
bring it to your attention
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
i don't anticipate having those answers
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
from cms
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
during the house phase so we will likely
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
be making a change request in the senate
 
01:02:52.079 --> 01:02:52.950 align:start position:0%
be making a change request in the senate
phase

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
phase
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
but we felt it was important to bring
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
your attention again this is a program
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have any control over
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
and it's probably also worth noting that
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
although this is a significant revenue
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
stream for the hospital
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
this is a program that's been under
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
continual threat of discontinuation at
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
the federal level so it's been proposed
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
quite a few times to start the process
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
of reducing
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
the amount of dish paid at a federal
 
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.670 align:start position:0%
the amount of dish paid at a federal
level

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
and there's even been kind of uh
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
schedules um
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
that that are intended to bring it back
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
down to zero and discontinue the program
 
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:25.910 align:start position:0%
down to zero and discontinue the program
altogether

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
so um from a financial perspective this
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
is kind of a high risk
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
area for us over the next probably five
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
to ten years
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
but but this this recent change in
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
will definitely impact us in the
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
upcoming biennium and uh
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
once we have those firm answers we'll be
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
able to come up with a firm number
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh and make an appropriate change
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
request so because
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
we have to do a markup uh what is a
 
01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:54.069 align:start position:0%
we have to do a markup uh what is a
reasonable

01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
in your opinion a reasonable contingency
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
risk reserve for this
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
5 million i i would say
 
01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.069 align:start position:0%
5 million i i would say
[Music]

01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes yeah at a minimum i think it will be
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
2 million
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
that upper end is really it's really
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
tricky because the questions we're
 
01:04:15.359 --> 01:04:16.390 align:start position:0%
tricky because the questions we're
asking

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
really changed the scope of that
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
our our dish consultants uh
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
have the same interpretation of the the
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
federal law change that i do
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
um but without that specific cms
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
guidance it's it's
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm a little hesitant as you can
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
probably tell to give a hard number
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
um no i can tell and that's five million
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes yep mr ripple would you kind of
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
keep track of that
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
because as we're talking about finding
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
money that that we may
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
we may want to have a plan for that as
 
01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:52.630 align:start position:0%
we may want to have a plan for that as
well

01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
yeah sure i will thank you sir
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
you want to go yep okay uh so the second
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh challenge we wanted to bring you
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
before you get going again before you
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
get going representative weiler has his
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
hand up is that is that
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
from the last time nope it's a new
 
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.589 align:start position:0%
from the last time nope it's a new
question

01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
what about collecting money from private
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
insurance or from the people that
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
are admitted from themselves uh is there
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
any money in this that's coming from
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
those people or from insurance
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question so we
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
do have a contract executed with blue
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
cross blue shield
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
um and contracting as a hospital with uh
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance carriers is a very
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
common practice so blue cross blue
 
01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:35.349 align:start position:0%
common practice so blue cross blue
shield

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
shield
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
is uh the currently the only con
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
contractor or insurance carrier we have
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
a contract with
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
we have attempted to contract with a lot
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
of other insurance carriers
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
um we have not been overly successful in
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
and i i think there's a few reasons
 
01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:52.870 align:start position:0%
and i i think there's a few reasons
there

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
so one is um a lot of the
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of the insurance carriers have
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
very few patients that come through our
 
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.230 align:start position:0%
very few patients that come through our
building

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
so uh what we do in those scenarios is
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
what's called a single case agreement
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
where we call up the insurance company
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
we come to an agreement for the
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
the specific admission that is in
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then we receive payment accordingly
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
um about 21
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
of the hospitals uh patients are have
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
some form of commercial insurance
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh the um when it comes to contracting
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
with insurance companies that's been an
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing challenge
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
um it is something that i've been
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
researching pretty hard
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the past couple of months i'm trying
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
to find uh
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
more definitive ways to um to make sure
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
we can execute these contracts
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's been a concern of mine uh as
 
01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.670 align:start position:0%
uh it's been a concern of mine uh as
i've

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
i've
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
oriented to the organization so
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're definitely going to try um i
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
i think i think it's not something we
 
01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:51.430 align:start position:0%
i think i think it's not something we
can

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
we can readily plan for at this point um
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
we've had uh almost eight months now of
 
01:06:57.599 --> 01:06:58.710 align:start position:0%
we've had uh almost eight months now of
negotiation

01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
with optum uh we've approached harvard
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
pilgrim in the past
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
um we've we've approached cigna um it's
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
really just challenging to get these
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
organizations to uh to sign an agreement
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
with us and
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
if i'm being 100 house i think part of
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
it is because we're a safety net
 
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.390 align:start position:0%
it is because we're a safety net
hospital

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
and you know we're not going to turn
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
anybody away because of their insurance
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
so um i am um i am
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
actively working on trying to find ways
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
to tighten that up a bit
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh but it's it's it's not a
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
it's not a clear-cut solution or there
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
isn't a clear-cut solution i guess i
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
should say
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can keep afford to
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
giving away free care
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
when we're one of the wealthiest states
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
if these people have something we could
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
attach or
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
collect money from whether it's property
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever rather than just
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
keep giving away and keep expanding the
 
01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
keep giving away and keep expanding the
tax

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
tax costs to the to the people that
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
are not using these we've got to do
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
something thank you
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
i should also just share that um we do
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
so we do what's called a financial
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
eligibility assessment on every single
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
patient that enters the hospital
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
um we do a back you know essentially a
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
resource check to see what they
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
have for available funds and if they do
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
have a significant
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
amount of wealth whether that be
 
01:08:15.599 --> 01:08:16.309 align:start position:0%
amount of wealth whether that be
property

01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
income savings accounts etc we do
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
work with the patient and or their
 
01:08:22.239 --> 01:08:23.189 align:start position:0%
work with the patient and or their
guardian

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
to make payment for the services that
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
they receive so we do collect self-pay
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
type payments from from any patient who
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
has the ability to do so
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't see a self-pay wedge in the
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
revenue bubble though
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
so that is uh considered a part of our
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
other revenue
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
i can certainly provide on our our
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
billing revenue side i could provide you
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
a percentage breakdown of how much comes
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
from medicaid how much comes from
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
how much comes from self-pay if you'd
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
like that that would not be a problem
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking about the slides you
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
showed showing
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
the fy 2223 and there there was no wedge
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
for self-pay
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just wondering if it was
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
overlooked or
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
or assumed to be part of something else
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's a part of
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
other revenues on that graph there's no
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
other revenue there is there
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
i don't i i don't recall in the 2223
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
seeing another wedge uh so
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
yeah if you want to go back heather so
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
2223 pie chart here the blue section
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
is other revenue uh and so that consists
 
01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.630 align:start position:0%
is other revenue uh and so that consists
of

01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
jeez i thought okay so that's my fault i
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
thought that was all federal
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh i missed i misheard when i saw this
 
01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh i missed i misheard when i saw this
slide

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
i apologize for the interruption because
 
01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:44.789 align:start position:0%
i apologize for the interruption because
i

01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
i assume that was red was
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
state and blue was federal and that's
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
obviously a horrible assumption
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
so um so moving on to the second concern
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
we wanted to bring up to
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
to your attention today uh so in
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh in that last gnc and
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think it was either november the first
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
one in december as i had mentioned
 
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.550 align:start position:0%
one in december as i had mentioned
before

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
the hospital had brought forth a mental
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
health worker pay enhancement
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
and this was really a vehicle or a tool
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
and a series of efforts to try to
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
improve emergency room boarding
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
so the hospitals as you mentioned you
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
know we struggle with recruitment and
 
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.590 align:start position:0%
know we struggle with recruitment and
retention

01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
retention
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
we have a high vacancy rate we're trying
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
to find ways to close that gap
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
and so one of the ways that we've we
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
felt we might be able to do that was
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
with a pain enhancement for mental
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
health workers
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
mental health workers are frontline
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
staff they're the ones who really
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh operate on the units on a day-to-day
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
basis with all of the patients
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
they provide assistance doing a lot of
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
daily activities
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
they perform a lot of safety functions
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
safety checks and regulatory
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
governed functions um
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh and and they're they're really just
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
the the front line staff
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
for the hospital
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
an issue that we've we've come to find
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
is that the wages that we've been paying
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
we really compete with um
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
i would say uh less hazardous
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
or potentially easier type positions out
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the community so
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
before this enhancement took place
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
mental health workers were earning
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
between 12 to
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
13 an hour kind of starting out
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
after a few years they might make a
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
comparable wage to a fast food worker in
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
the concord area
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh and so you know we're really
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
struggling to to recruit at that level
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh knowing that there are some of these
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
other positions uh out there in the
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
community that people could
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
could achieve so i assume you're talking
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
about lnas not
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
rns um actually we're not even talking
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
about lnas in this instance so these are
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
unlicensed individuals
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
some of them do have lna licenses but
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
you do not need a license to be a mental
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
health worker
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
um so they they don't
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
they don't do a lot of um medical type
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
care they do
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
sorry i just wanted to understand what
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
that 12 to 13 dollars was that that's
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's pre-lna for the most part
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
correct correct um
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
are you offering those people um
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
any sort of education benefits so that
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
they start moving up the lna
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i can take that question so yes
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
um what happens when we hire a mental
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
health worker if they're
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
our person that has not had experience
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's multiple weeks of training
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
really in psychiatric care
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
um so it's you it's not really an
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
equivalent to an lna's you know scope of
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
practice so when lna provides you know
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
hands-on care medical
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
care vital signs things like that mental
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
health worker
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be trained on how to react in a
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
how to have a therapeutic relationship
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
how to
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
um ensure safety of of
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
patients and staff because it can be
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
it can be a pretty intense environment
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
here for someone who's not
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know stable psychiatrically
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
particularly on admission
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
so they receive all of that training
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
once they are employees here we
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely work with them many of them
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
go on to pursue nursing
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
licenses particularly rn um psychiatric
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
nurse um licensure for sure
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
so that is something that we have been
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
working on
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
so you know this enhancement really was
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
part of not only attracting new staff
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
but retaining the staff that we had
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
because we you know found that we
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know invested all of this time in
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
training um
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
for these mental health workers in a
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
very specific role
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
um and then they were leaving um to go
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know work in in an environment that
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
was easier whether it's target or
 
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.630 align:start position:0%
was easier whether it's target or
walmart

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
walmart
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's kind of why i like the
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
idea of an educational benefit that
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
gives them golden handcuffs to stay for
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
a few years after
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
achieving their rn or something yeah
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
another thing that we're working on
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
actually chuck bagley is our staff
 
01:14:34.159 --> 01:14:34.790 align:start position:0%
actually chuck bagley is our staff
engagement

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
director and we are developing an lna
 
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.390 align:start position:0%
director and we are developing an lna
program

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
in our curriculum that we will run here
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
at the hospital
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we're doing a lot of
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
outreach with
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
um nursing programs to see what creative
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
solutions we can come up with
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
to have it be to their benefit and to
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
ours to
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
to get folks through nursing school so
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
i would just mention that as far as
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
tuition reimbursement
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
the department does offer some tuition
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
is budgeted within the human resources
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
budget for the whole department
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
which is something that we covered in
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner there was
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
several hundred thousand dollars in a
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
training line
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
um that was training for employees and
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
that is where
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
we would reimburse for tuition from and
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
that goes through governor and council
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
i hope that they incur an obligation
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
period after
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
accepting the money whether we can
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
enforce it or not i hope we're at least
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
asking for a couple three years after
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
they receive the money to stay
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
i don't recall but we could get you that
 
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.110 align:start position:0%
i don't recall but we could get you that
information

01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead i'm sorry i i
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
interrupted you joe
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
oh no no problem it's a great question
 
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.669 align:start position:0%
oh no no problem it's a great question
um

01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
so uh so this was approved um you know
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
recently and uh so once it was approved
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
we worked really hard to get it built
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh into the payroll system of the state
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh and then we started working uh to get
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
it built into the budget system
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh that process took
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
a lot longer than i i think um we would
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
have liked so there were some
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
interesting questions that came up of
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
does the 20 apply to just base pay does
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
it apply to base play plus
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
shift differential um you know we had to
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
sort through some of those nuances
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
and so by the time we really got this
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
built in for every single position into
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the budget system
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh what really ended up happening was we
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
ran out of
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
days or time uh in the governor's phase
 
01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:36.229 align:start position:0%
days or time uh in the governor's phase
so

01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
um so we were able to get it built in um
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
but when it
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
when we finally got it in uh it put us
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
over the really the general fund target
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
we were shooting for so
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
um given that we we transition it to be
 
01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.030 align:start position:0%
um given that we we transition it to be
100

01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
other funded to keep the total budget
 
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.229 align:start position:0%
other funded to keep the total budget
request

01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
in line with the hospital's needs um but
 
01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
in line with the hospital's needs um but
uh

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
the challenge here is the hospital
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to earn
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh more revenue because it's incurred uh
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
this cost
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
we really tying this back to uh trying
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
to increase
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
our ability to respond to the emergency
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
room boarding crisis
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
to increase census we need to increase
 
01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.030 align:start position:0%
to increase census we need to increase
staffing

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
to increase staffing we need to improve
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's really the kind of the
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
cornerstone of where this
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
this idea came from in the 2021 uh
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
budget i do want to emphasize
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
um so because we had some vacancies for
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
the six months prior to this being
 
01:17:36.159 --> 01:17:36.950 align:start position:0%
the six months prior to this being
approved

01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
um the department felt conf confident
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
that we could try to fund
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
the rest of fiscal year 21. 21 for this
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
enhancement and so we
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
we have so this is something currently
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
being paid
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
and but we don't anticipate those
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
vacancy dollars being available
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming biennium again because
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're taking such an aggressive
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
approach towards
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
approach towards recruitment and
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
retention um and you know some
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing some some successes in
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
terms of that that
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
attempt to permanent staffing contract
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
we've executed so
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
so does it seem to me like you you're
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
wanting to tell us a dollar amount that
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
we need to anticipate being added
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
as part of this change request yes you
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
would you might go to the next slide
 
01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.149 align:start position:0%
would you might go to the next slide
ruining so uh

01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
ruining so uh
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the secret but no i i appreciate
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so these are the uh the numbers uh
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
for each
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh year of the biennium um you know
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
i certainly understand these are pretty
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
significant numbers especially in the
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
context of your opening remarks uh
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
chairman relative to to um goals for the
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
house uh house budget
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
so um but these are the fun uh these are
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
the amounts as it stands based off the
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
number of positions we have
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
and the positions that the enhancement
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
would apply to
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
um okay so so far it's feeling to me
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
like we need to be thinking about 20
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
more over the two years for uh
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
the hospital that are not in the general
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
fund's budget
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
so so that's a significant amount of
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
money for us to
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
look for representative waller you had
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
i kept talking do you have a question
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
man no this slide answered my question
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
well that's like real money so if we
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
could uh
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
get your help looking for it i i'd
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
certainly i i think you know we're gonna
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
i've scrutinized this uh ad nauseam with
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
my team we're gonna continue to
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
scrutinize it to try to see uh
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
if there are any opportunities um but
 
01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.510 align:start position:0%
if there are any opportunities um but
we're

01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
we've done quite an extensive uh uh
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
dive at this point and so ultimately
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is this was the
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
number in the slide that i felt i had to
 
01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:03.030 align:start position:0%
number in the slide that i felt i had to
present

01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
so then in terms of um our accounting
 
01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.390 align:start position:0%
so then in terms of um our accounting
units

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
so um these are our accounting units uh
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
the first one listed here 6096 is
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
actually going to be
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed in a separate presentation um
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
we created a presentation just for the
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
path center knowing that it's a new
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
program and
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
and we thought it would just be helpful
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
to give you some extra context on that
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
um the remainder of these are all
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
accounting units for the hospital
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and so chairman would you like me to
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
open the budget book or the briefing
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
book first
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
i hit the budget book first okay
 
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.990 align:start position:0%
i hit the budget book first okay
um

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
heather do you want to stop screen
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
sharing for a second
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
mr ripple uh before he continues
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
how do you think we're doing on time you
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
you see the big picture there
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
are we are we behind schedule at this
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
point it feels to me like
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
i'm running this a little are you good i
 
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:07.669 align:start position:0%
i'm running this a little are you good i
think

01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
possibly you do have three more
 
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
possibly you do have three more
presentations

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
that that is correct the next two that
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
heather and i will be presenting i do
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
think will be shorter
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
the path center certainly will be
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
shorter um
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
i i would like to be done i would like
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
to be done by
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
by three o'clock i don't know i'm
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
looking at everyone's faces on zoom i'm
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
not seeing anyone
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
freak out when i say three o'clock so um
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:04.330 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to go through all 1374
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
pages of this
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry this is the briefing book
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know while you're getting ready
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
there um we've been we've been talking
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
for almost two hours i'm i'm thinking
 
01:22:40.639 --> 01:22:41.270 align:start position:0%
for almost two hours i'm i'm thinking
maybe

01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh the committee and the attendees could
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
use a
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
like a five minute bio break five ten
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
minute bio break
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
so so why don't you um
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
mr christie um get ready
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and and then we'll we'll come back i i
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
have us at 11
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
23 we'll come back at exactly 11 30
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
after a bio break
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know mr ripple if you have to
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
put a recess sign up
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
kevin i believe heather and i are just
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.840 --> 01:30:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.669 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh 11 30. do we have the
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
i i feel like romper room
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
i see keith
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
i see mary jane i see harry
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay i think i think we have a quorum so
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
um we don't see you
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
oh you don't nice
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
i mean hopefully i don't have anything
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
in my teeth that was a pretty quick
 
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.110 align:start position:0%
in my teeth that was a pretty quick
sandwich

01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
sandwich
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
um all right mr christie you're
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
you're up okay um so i'm
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh sharing the um the budget document
 
01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.590 align:start position:0%
uh sharing the um the budget document
now

01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
but really starting at the accounting
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
units relative to the presentation we
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
just had would be
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
starting with 8400 here i'm happy to
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
so i i think you've explained in the
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
slide deck
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
why expenses 10 and 12
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
are going up in the biennium by a
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
correct it's um in in the accounting
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
unit 8 400 that is solely because of
 
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.270 align:start position:0%
unit 8 400 that is solely because of
increases

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh scheduled increases in wages but
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're successful
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
um so it's somewhat depending on the
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
i would say a accounting unit but so in
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
8400 for example
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
this is administrative staff who are
 
01:32:09.199 --> 01:32:10.070 align:start position:0%
this is administrative staff who are
just

01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
receiving essentially a step increase in
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
their pay so it's
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
a higher cost for the same same amount
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
of hours worked
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
and then in other sections so 8750
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
which is our really our direct care
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's where the significant increase is
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
represented in from a payroll
 
01:32:29.199 --> 01:32:30.470 align:start position:0%
represented in from a payroll
perspective

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that's driven by both increases in
 
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.149 align:start position:0%
and that's driven by both increases in
wages

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
wages
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
but also increases in position counts
 
01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:37.350 align:start position:0%
but also increases in position counts
yeah

01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry so it took me just a moment to
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
get my head
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
into the right space here so you're only
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
adding one fte on your permanent
 
01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
adding one fte on your permanent
classified

01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
classified
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
but you're driving your personnel costs
 
01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:52.830 align:start position:0%
but you're driving your personnel costs
up

01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
substantially in the biennium for the
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
one extra person plus step increases so
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 8 400 at admin right
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
joe if i can just add there i believe
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
that there were unfunded positions
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
and 20 and 21 which are now funded in 22
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
and 23.
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i believe that's also part of that
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
increases some previously unfunded
 
01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
increases some previously unfunded
positions

01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay do you want to move us back to that
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
slide one go back one
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
sure because that's where it is that's
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
where the money is
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to let mr ripple speak
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
first and then
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
and then representative walner had her
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
hand up and
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
weiler and nordgren thanks the one thing
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
i wanted to point out that you will see
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
agency-wide and budget-wide
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
is personnel costs in
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
22 might appear somewhat high because
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are 27 pay periods instead of 26
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's that explains part of it
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
all right so uh representative was that
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
it mr ripple that's a good ad
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh mr or excuse me
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you so i the 20
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
um increase in wages
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
probable that you say we might need to
 
01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.110 align:start position:0%
probable that you say we might need to
anticipate

01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
does not it would not um affect this
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
page is that correct
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh so that's correct the total value
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
for that pay enhancement is built into
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
this budget it's more of a source of
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
funds issue
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
so it's currently funded as a hundred
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
percent other revenue sources
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
not uh general funds and the challenge
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
there is we we can't earn that money um
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we we don't have an ability to earn
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
that money okay
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i see that the
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
class 10 went down in 2021 i assume
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's because of vacancies
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
and you say you're trying to recruit and
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
so you're going forward you're
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
assuming full uh
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
membership or full uh full
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
positions i don't think we can assume
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
that we can't afford it
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't be so quick to if you can
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
personnel then you've got to continue
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
that because
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
we cannot afford a 15 20 increase which
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
you're showing here there's no way
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
unless you're going to go out get some
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
i certainly under understand that i
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
think um
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think the the thought processes
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
um for at least for us we're really
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
trying to make some fundamental changes
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
to emergency room boarding and we feel
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
that some of these changes would be the
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
things we need to to really try to start
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
so that might be really a good thing for
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
us to go over
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
after we get out of the heat of battle
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
on the budget
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
um you know where we have a little bit
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
more time to
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
reflect on on on the big plans
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
um representative waller your hand is
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
still up did you have a question still
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
no i just keep forgetting to put it down
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative norgren you had your hand
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
up and yours is down now so do you have
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
oh we may have lost her altogether
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
because she was there with her hand up
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
and now
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
i don't see her or hear her um
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
okay i don't have my hand up
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
oh okay all right um
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
put your hand up anytime uh so
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
so the other thing that jumps out here
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
is uh expense
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
zero six zero benefits and i think what
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell me
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
is that this is a fixed percentage that
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
you're given by
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
somebody else and you have to apply it
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
to your
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
yup that's correct it's a fixed
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
percentage based off class 10
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
18 19 um
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
and uh 59 if there was one
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
but yes that's that's a percentage uh
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
given to us by
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
services um
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe i i
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
tuned into a prior presentation and i
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
know this is a question that came up
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
these numbers do look consistent with
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions if you
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
want to continue
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay um so
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
8410 is is really our supportive
 
01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.470 align:start position:0%
8410 is is really our supportive
services

01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so that you know
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
our facilities teams our food and
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
nutrition department
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
again increases really being relative to
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
to to payroll
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
it kind of in a general synopsis of the
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
hospital's budget the
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
you know i think we mentioned before
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
that um you know 72 percent of our staff
 
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
are direct care but i think
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
proportionally just the uh payroll to
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
to uh other lines of the budget um is
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
is quite high so um
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't uh we didn't budget
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
anymore for equipment we didn't budget
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
anymore for
 
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
supplies we kept all of those flat
 
01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:02.149 align:start position:0%
supplies we kept all of those flat
[Music]

01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
and some of them you know some of the
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
other expenses we work hard to try to
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
either reduce or at least
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
keep them keep them flat so i see the
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
food institution money is there
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
is there should i be seeing a furniture
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
line here
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh so that is actually in 8400 so
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
um this class 30 equipment line right
 
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.669 align:start position:0%
um this class 30 equipment line right
here

01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
that is relative to any equipment or
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
furniture for the hospital
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
and this this value comprises the
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
hospital's entire
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
equipment and furniture budget
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay and what does that represent ten
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
percent replacement
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
5 replacement 100
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
um i would say off the top of my head i
 
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
so it's it's pretty challenging most of
 
01:39:52.719 --> 01:39:53.109 align:start position:0%
so it's it's pretty challenging most of
our

01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
replacements year over year are when
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
things are hitting the end of useful
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
life when we're not
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and there are quite a few pieces of
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
equipment we drag out beyond
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer's you know stated use
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
of life so long as it
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
keeps functioning and it's properly
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
serviced by a biomedical engineering
 
01:40:11.199 --> 01:40:13.910 align:start position:0%
serviced by a biomedical engineering
service

01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking back at 8410 and there's a
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
such a tiny amount for 0.37
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
technology hardware yeah
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a mistake if that's
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in somebody else's budget
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
and accidentally ended up here
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm not a hundred percent
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
i can't recall exactly how we arrived at
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
that number class 38 and 37
 
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
are um two new lines to new hampshire
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals budget we used to charge these
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh i believe to class 30
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh or class 20 depending on the dollar
 
01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:50.790 align:start position:0%
uh or class 20 depending on the dollar
amount

01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh and we felt that these classes
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
offered a greater specificity
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
on some of the items we were buying so
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
we included them in this upcoming budget
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying it looks like it's
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
either a mistake or it's not enough
 
01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.430 align:start position:0%
either a mistake or it's not enough
money

01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
i think i i i think it's the latter
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
um i think it's not enough money but i
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
think that's because we wanted to just
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
create the class line
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
but also know that um
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
know that we were trying to keep things
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh relatively flat
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunications you you you spend
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
that with
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
doit or do you have direct contracts
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh that is really through doit
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
um i would say the only i still think
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's a doit service though but
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
um you know cable and internet and
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
things like that in the building
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
um i believe that's the majority of that
 
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.030 align:start position:0%
um i believe that's the majority of that
line

01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you i see
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative erf with the question
 
01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.510 align:start position:0%
representative erf with the question
here

01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
what is the transfer to other state
 
01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.709 align:start position:0%
what is the transfer to other state
agencies

01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
great question so the state office
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
campus police department so at new
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital the state
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
office police department is actually
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
housed inside our hospital
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and we require their services on
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
occasion um
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
in in working with some of our patients
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
so this is really for the cost
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
of that police department
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's a transfer to the
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
department of safety okay
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
wow how do you measure service provided
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
or service requested for this line
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
do you have a measure or is that just a
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
number that you all agree on
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh so uh and heather jump in here if i i
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
misspeak but i
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
believe we really try to maintain at
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
least two officers on site
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
at all times uh really for safety
 
01:42:54.239 --> 01:42:54.870 align:start position:0%
at all times uh really for safety
reasons

01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
so um you know in scenarios where an
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
individual might escalate
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
to a point where we require their
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
assistance we really try to have at
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
least two people on site 24 7.
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i would agree with that we do have
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
a dispatch
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
person that's also part of that but
 
01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.189 align:start position:0%
person that's also part of that but
that's

01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
really very necessary at night in
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
particular when we don't have
 
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.590 align:start position:0%
particular when we don't have
receptionists

01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
receptionists
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
on duty that dispatch person handles
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
emergency calls from the units and
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
and release that to the officers so
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
yes very good people need to be safe
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
um all right thank you are there i have
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's another question by
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative earth
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
now my bad i should take my hand down
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
sorry okay
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
all right uh you can continue
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh so
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh 8750 again is really where all of our
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
direct care
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
costs are incurred
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
again the majority of this increase is
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to happy to take any questions
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think one of the consequences of
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
putting the plus and up the 30
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the prominent classified is that it's
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
increasing your your 0-10 expense line
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
and i i still don't quite get
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
your logic on why you're creating 30
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
more spaces when you can't
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
fill the 438 you already have
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
i don't get it and and and if that
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be done
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
that would that would lower uh the 0-10
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
personal services line in a way that
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
that is that is correct i think our our
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
logic behind
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
those 30 positions um is that
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
we intend to fill them and we are
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
actively changing
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
the rate in which we are able to recruit
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
and we're actually
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
i would say not just hoping we're seeing
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
results in that
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
that realm as well um so again between
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
just december and now we've hired 24 new
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
mental health workers
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
through um through a attempt to
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
permanent contract that we've executed
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh and that's a that's a significant
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
increase you know at the time we
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
executed that contract we had 35 mental
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
health worker vacancies to
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
to so we've we filled 24 of them um
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
up to this point um and that you know
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to try to find
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
alternative ways to recruit for
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
positions like nursing and so forth
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
so not to nickel and darmian but if fy22
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
showed a ramp up instead if let's say it
 
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.350 align:start position:0%
showed a ramp up instead if let's say it
was

01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
445 or 450 instead of 468 as a ramp up
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
that would take down some of your
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
expense lines and maybe
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
actually fit a recruiting reality better
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
is that possible um
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
we could certainly think through that
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
exercise the one thing i would be
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
hesitant about so
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
so this is where we really have to dig
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
into a staffing model on our side
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
is just that we can't partially staff a
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
unit per se so we either have to staff
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
it or not staff it
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
you know it's we'd have to really i
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
think dig into that and do a pretty
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
significant analysis to see what that
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
right what that right amount might be if
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of middle ground
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
well i'd appreciate that because it
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
sounds to me that you're
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
sitting at around 3 30 actual bodies
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
now 330 to 350 and so that's a lot of
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
successful recruiting
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
but um but you but if you could really
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
look at that i'd appreciate it
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative wallner you've had your
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you so on this page
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
could we take a look at the uh line 102
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely would you like to yeah could
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
you just
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
just outline for us what's in there
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
sure um so class 102 in this accounting
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
unit the primary expense is the
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
dartmouth contract
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
so it's a contract for all of our
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
physicians and nurse practitioners
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
um at the hospital all of the
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
psychiatric providers
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that's a significant portion of that
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
line another aspect of that line is our
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
travel nurse contracts
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
so on occasion we're able to secure
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
travel nurses
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
it's been less frequent since the
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic the cost of travel nurses has
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
has skyrocketed due to the pandemic uh
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
we don't we no longer really have
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
competitive rates there um
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
we tried to do a rate increase recently
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and that hasn't really worked out
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
well for us either so
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
um but the the second portion of that is
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh the travel nurse contract um i'm
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
trying to recall if there's any other
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
contracts in that line
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
um oh and the the attempt to permanent
 
01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.189 align:start position:0%
um oh and the the attempt to permanent
staffing

01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
contract that i mentioned earlier as
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
well a portion of that contract is paid
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
out of this line
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
and then a portion of it is paid out of
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
the past center class 102.
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
so um those i think those three
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
contracts are
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
comprise the total dollar values you're
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
seeing there
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yep i was going to guess
 
01:48:21.119 --> 01:48:21.830 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yep i was going to guess
hampstead

01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
hampstead
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
hospital contract i i would have been
 
01:48:24.719 --> 01:48:25.430 align:start position:0%
hospital contract i i would have been
wrong

01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
where's the hampstead hospital contract
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
hampstead is in
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
so this line right here you can see
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
because it's only been a partial year in
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
we spent you know 330 000 last year um
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't have anything per se
 
01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.229 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't have anything per se
budgeted

01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
um because it was so new but we have
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
spent money there
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
um and then really it's a it's a
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
structured contract so we anticipate
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
between 1.2 and 1.6 million a year
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
are you going to show up with an fy 2021
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
problem that we need to transfer money
 
01:49:13.599 --> 01:49:15.669 align:start position:0%
problem that we need to transfer money
for

01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
um no uh not for the hampshire contract
 
01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:18.870 align:start position:0%
um no uh not for the hampshire contract
so

01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
the way that money was appropriated we
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
were given five million
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh that was non-lapsing money um
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so uh so you know it's it's
 
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
after 87.50 we just have some um
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
smaller accounting units relative to
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
specific functions we're either required
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
to manage by law
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
um i did also want to mention obviously
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
the hospital has a trust fund so we have
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
various accounting units for the trust
 
01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:57.750 align:start position:0%
various accounting units for the trust
fund

01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
the trust fund is is managed by a trust
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
and really
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
does a lot for patient discharging so
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
uses that fund for things like buying
 
01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.229 align:start position:0%
uses that fund for things like buying
individuals

01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
shoes upon discharge or paying first
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
months rent to try to get them out of
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know those those types of things
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
really helping to enhance and facilitate
 
01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.510 align:start position:0%
really helping to enhance and facilitate
discharging

01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
discharging
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
and then occasionally doing
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
doing random purchases on behalf of
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
patients in some capacity to improve
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
their experience
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
my my left eye had surgery so i'm just
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
having a little trouble focusing
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
what which line item are you referring
 
01:50:44.159 --> 01:50:45.510 align:start position:0%
what which line item are you referring
to

01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
um sure so um let's see
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
so it's a bit challenging i see it i see
 
01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.830 align:start position:0%
so it's a bit challenging i see it i see
it

01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
so um this this line right here is the
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
primary spend
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
out of our trust fund there are multiple
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
accounting units
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
that we use um with trust fund money so
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
i think there's like five or six
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
um but this is the primary spend out of
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the trust fund right here
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's a huge change 738 projected for
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
down to 183 so what what what's going on
 
01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.629 align:start position:0%
down to 183 so what what what's going on
there

01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
um so that is a combination of
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
um the the discharging spend that i had
 
01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:29.750 align:start position:0%
um the the discharging spend that i had
mentioned

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
um and then the trust trust fund after
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh not getting uh furniture and
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
renovations approved in a prior biennium
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh took it upon themselves to uh
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
purchase uh and try to replace some
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
things that that were deemed a
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
safety hazard for patients
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay so we spent trust fund money on the
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
furniture we needed for infectious
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
control purposes
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
um not all of it uh just just and it
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't so much for infection control it
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
was more to do with
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
um with uh safety um it was
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
things that could break and be used uh
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
used as a weapon or things of that
 
01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
used as a weapon or things of that
nature

01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the army we used to refer to the
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
color of money
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't use different pots of
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
money for different things and so i
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
would just assume you're
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that you all are spending
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately from the
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
correct pots that is correct so the the
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund cannot be used to supplant
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
operating dollars
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
um and we coordinate uh with the
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
charitable trust uh organization on on
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
um or on managing our trust fund i
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
should say
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
um it was really uh relative to patient
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
safety issues and knowing that the funds
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
had been requested in a prior biennium
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's where that purchase came
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
from so but yes we we do
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
actively uh work to make sure we're
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
spending these these monies in the most
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate way
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh and that's that's really it for the
 
01:53:00.719 --> 01:53:02.310 align:start position:0%
uh and that's that's really it for the
hospital

01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay are there any uh questions from the
 
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:06.950 align:start position:0%
okay are there any uh questions from the
committee

01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any okay we're gonna try
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
something new
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i see that we have about 25 attendees

listening i guess um
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
but uh if you have any comments or
 
01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.510 align:start position:0%
but uh if you have any comments or
questions

01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%

we can't see your badge
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
that you identify yourself as a lobbyist
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh are are there any hands raised
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
mr norton if you're if you're out there
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
i i kind of asked you a question
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
earlier about uh
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
pediatric care and having kids uh
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
bordered in the in the hospitals in the
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
ers or
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
if you're there i'd like to hear your
 
01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.510 align:start position:0%
if you're there i'd like to hear your
thoughts

01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
hi mr chairman and committee members um
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
speak i thought that
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
um heather and her team did an excellent
 
01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.629 align:start position:0%
um heather and her team did an excellent
presentation

01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
um obviously um
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
the situation with children is pretty
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
dire right now um and
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
as was represented it's a little bit
 
01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.550 align:start position:0%
as was represented it's a little bit
scary

01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
scary
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic not knowing um
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
where these numbers are going to go in
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a real cause for concern
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
obviously the
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
the 10 additional beds at new hampshire
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
hospital was
 
01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
a critical move albeit it pushed the
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
adult numbers up
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
and you know one of the things that i'm
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit unclear
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
about and and maybe um heather could
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
could answer this is that when we
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
contracted with hampstead as a state
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
um there were essentially two two
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
in-state options for
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
children with psychiatric inpatient
 
01:55:37.599 --> 01:55:38.550 align:start position:0%
children with psychiatric inpatient
needs

01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
one was new hampshire hospital and one
 
01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
was hampstead
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
so when we contracted with
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
hampstead then there just became one
 
01:55:48.239 --> 01:55:48.790 align:start position:0%
hampstead then there just became one
option

01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
hampstead and it's unclear to me whether
 
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.910 align:start position:0%
hampstead and it's unclear to me whether
we

01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
net resulted in an increase in beds or
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
whether that
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
combination of um of contracting with
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
hampstead resulted in a decrease of beds
 
01:56:04.239 --> 01:56:04.950 align:start position:0%
hampstead resulted in a decrease of beds
overall

01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
for kids um so that that was one of the
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
questions i had and then
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
um you know a couple other points that i
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to make was
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
that um i just wanted to
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
follow up the comments that um mr
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
karisti made about insurance companies
 
01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:25.750 align:start position:0%
karisti made about insurance companies
and

01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
and commercial insurers paying this is a
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
significant issue in my mind and
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
something that we nominate new hampshire
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
and others have been trying to
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
address in a variety of ways the new
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire insurance department does have
 
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.229 align:start position:0%
hampshire insurance department does have
a

01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
a mental health and addiction advisory
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
um i i think as he alluded to one of the
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that i have is that
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
um the the commercial insurance
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
companies are
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
they have an obligation to their members
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
to provide for
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
capacity for inpatient and outpatient
 
01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.310 align:start position:0%
capacity for inpatient and outpatient
care

01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that part of what's
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
a an attempt on some level to push the
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
care of people with serious mental
 
01:57:17.199 --> 01:57:17.750 align:start position:0%
care of people with serious mental
illness

01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
illness
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
onto the state and
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
and and that care should be born across
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
a number of different places should be
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
born across
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
insurance companies should be hospitals
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
certainly the k
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
the state has um has some responsibility
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
as well but um but the fact that we're
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
having so many folks in our emergency
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
department waiting for boarding in my
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
mind indicates that
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
there's not adequate network capacity
 
01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:47.589 align:start position:0%
there's not adequate network capacity
and

01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
um i applaud the fact that you know that
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
anthem does contract with new hampshire
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
hospital but i question
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
even you know if the numbers are low why
 
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
the other insurance companies don't
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
um and one other question i have is
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
is about um the
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
um the imd exclusion and sorry i'm
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
having a brain
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
brain cramp about the acronym um it's
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
the institutional mental disorders
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
exclusion which in the past has
 
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:19.589 align:start position:0%
exclusion which in the past has
precluded

01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
precluded
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
use of medicaid funds to pay for
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
inpatient psychiatric hospital care
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
by at the federal level but there is now
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
a waiver process that's
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
available for that i believe and
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not sure how that plays into
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
current um or future
 
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
um budget issues so those are just a few
 
01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
of the thoughts i have
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
really appreciate all of the questions
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
the committee asked and uh and the
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
presentation that was given
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
so let me follow up on your last item
 
01:58:56.239 --> 01:58:56.709 align:start position:0%
so let me follow up on your last item
first

01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
and that is uh who who within dhhs
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
owns the medicaid waiver process that
 
01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:05.189 align:start position:0%
owns the medicaid waiver process that
might

01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
pursue a medicaid waiver for the new
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
for institutional care so i i can
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually speak to that
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
that topic uh we've we've actually been
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
researching that waiver process for
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
a little over a year now at this point
 
01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:22.709 align:start position:0%
a little over a year now at this point
um

01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
it uh so the the imd exclusion rule that
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
was uh that can reference
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
um essentially for patients between the
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
ages of 22 and 64
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
who have medicaid um their their
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
care essentially cannot be uh reimbursed
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
in an institute for mental disease which
 
01:59:40.159 --> 01:59:40.550 align:start position:0%
in an institute for mental disease which
is

01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
which is kind of what new hampshire
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
hospital is is called from a regulatory
 
01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.070 align:start position:0%
hospital is is called from a regulatory
perspective

01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
and so for that portion of patients a
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
lot of that care goes uncompensated and
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
that gets into those dish payments i was
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
so the waiver process there is a new
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
waiver to try to get around
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
that piece of law to some degree and
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's a portion of the social security
 
02:00:02.639 --> 02:00:03.350 align:start position:0%
it's a portion of the social security
act

02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
that that creates the imd exclusion rule
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
so the waiver process would allow for
 
02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.310 align:start position:0%
so the waiver process would allow for
payment

02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
payment
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh i believe it is up to uh for length
 
02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
lengths of stay
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
up to 60 days uh after 60 days to oh
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
sorry so quote a famous boxer no moss no
 
02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:23.589 align:start position:0%
sorry so quote a famous boxer no moss no
moss

02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
moss
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
just to keep us going i wanted to make
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
sure i i knew that somebody owned
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
the research problem and it sounds like
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
you're all over it
 
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
and you don't have an answer yet and i
 
02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:34.390 align:start position:0%
and you don't have an answer yet and i
just

02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
add very quickly to that that this is
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
also part of what the commissioner and i
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
presented on in the department overview
 
02:00:40.719 --> 02:00:41.830 align:start position:0%
presented on in the department overview
presentation

02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we are hoping to have alvarez and
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
marcel which we refer to as a
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
i thought mr norton asked a good
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
question i had assumed if we were going
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
to hampstead
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
we would have been increasing our
 
02:00:58.480 --> 02:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
we would have been increasing our
pediatric

02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
pediatric
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatric beds on the net
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
did we do that or did we somehow reduce
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
it accidentally
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't reduce it was um a slight
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
increase and by slight i mean by just a
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
couple of beds at the time that we
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
um pursued that contract we had seen
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
historically that occupancy here at the
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
hospital had been dropping
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
from 2017 into 2018. um when we looked
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
at census trends
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
um at the time again pre-pandemic
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
making the transition to hampstead um
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
provided enough bets based on the data
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
that we had about referrals
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
and patient days so when we
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
when we created the contract with
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
hampstead at that point we were only
 
02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.229 align:start position:0%
hampstead at that point we were only
occupying

02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
occupying
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
12 beds here for kids at the hospital
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
and not at full occupancy i mean we were
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
running with a census of
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
three four five children on that unit um
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
so when we created that contract with
 
02:01:57.679 --> 02:01:58.629 align:start position:0%
so when we created that contract with
hampstead

02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
hampstead
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
part of what we talked about was
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
that they would occupy then a vacant
 
02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.189 align:start position:0%
that they would occupy then a vacant
unit

02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
so upon doing that that was sort of a
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
wash that vacant unit was i think
 
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
15 or 17 beds and again with
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
closing that 12 bed unit that we had it
 
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
seemed like
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
a number that would work based on trends
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
um with census and again that has all
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
changed just during the pandemic
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
so at the time that we put the contract
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
together it seemed like there were there
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
would be enough access
 
02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
to children at hampstead not a huge
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
increase in number of beds
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
but we didn't feel that they were needed
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
and then you had a second question in
 
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
there but mr norton i
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
i wanted to come back and it just seems
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
to me um
 
02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
that we do a lot of damage to kids
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
who are hurt and need some mental health
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
services and then we're keeping them
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
aborted in the er and i would like to
 
02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.109 align:start position:0%
aborted in the er and i would like to
know

02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
um relatively speaking
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
since we're not talking optimally
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
speaking but relatively speaking
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
would we be better off just getting
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
these kids back home
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
with some kind of wrap-around services
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
albeit minor
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
than to hang on to them into the in a
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
boarding s
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
boarding operation thank you for your
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
question mr chairman
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
and um that is a key question and you're
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to hear more about that this
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon when
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
the children's bureau of behavioral
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
health presents and
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know to to heather's point one of
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we face as a state
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
is how we how we uh determine capacity
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
for inpatient beds versus
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
community capacity and community
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
capacity to your point
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
is the desired outcome we want children
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
to stay with their families in their
 
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.109 align:start position:0%
to stay with their families in their
communities

02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
in their schools with natural supports
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
there is a fast forward program which
 
02:03:56.550 --> 02:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
developed which you'll hear more about
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
this afternoon which focuses on
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
children that are at risk of placement
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
outside the home and does provide those
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
that level of wrap around care
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
again don't want to exclusively pick on
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies but you know
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
one of the issues is is getting
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to pay for
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
um in-home levels of support
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
particularly if they're not
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
master's level or licensed clinicians
 
02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:25.669 align:start position:0%
master's level or licensed clinicians
but

02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
to your point yes that is the goal is to
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know to provide as much
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
community-based in-home supports as
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
possible but that's also
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know i don't want to minimize the
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
acuity of some of the children that are
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
showing up
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
in our emergency rooms right now in
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
terms of their need for
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
inpatient um treatment all right
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not seeing any other
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
participant hands up did did you get all
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
answered mr norton yes
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh stepping up i see a
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
hand raised by somebody
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
a panelist their representative verve
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
so i know i thought you said there are
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
no more panelists i can wait
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
no there i i you are a panelist that
 
02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:12.709 align:start position:0%
no there i i you are a panelist that
that's

02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's good to be a panelist it's the
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
attendees who are
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the cheap seats
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
just a quick question i must have must
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
have missed it what is the
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
1696 a community residence that's new
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
apparently with
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
35 employees that's going to be our next
 
02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:31.350 align:start position:0%
35 employees that's going to be our next
presentation

02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
oh i thought that was part of the
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
hospital okay it's it's part of the
 
02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.270 align:start position:0%
hospital okay it's it's part of the
hospital's

02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
hospital's
 
02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
agency number but we felt because it's a
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
new facility and a new program we would
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
we would do a separate presentation on
 
02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
we would do a separate presentation on
it

02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh i think we're ready to go uh try to
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
try to give us a 30 to 45 minute
 
02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:53.679 align:start position:0%
bite at the apple and and we'll break
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
for lunch
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh at that point uh hopefully that's you
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
got a natural cutoff point for that
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
great so
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
are you seeing my screen right now for
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
the path center
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
great okay um so i actually think that
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
this presentation will be
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
um a bit quicker than the others it's
 
02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:14.470 align:start position:0%
um a bit quicker than the others it's
shorter

02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
shorter
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it's a brand new program
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
here's the agenda the overview of what
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'll talk about it's very similar to the
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
one that we presented for new hampshire
 
02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:25.350 align:start position:0%
one that we presented for new hampshire
hospital

02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
and um i think i might need
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thanks
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
so um contact information is listed here
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
so the funds for for the path program
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh were appropriated as part of hb4 in
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
the 2021 biennium
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
the department used a portion of those
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
funds to establish the path center which
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
is our 16 bed transitional housing
 
02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
is our 16 bed transitional housing
facility

02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
located in the former philbrook building
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
here on campus we opened in september of
 
02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.629 align:start position:0%
here on campus we opened in september of
2020

02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
and right now the path center again
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
serves as an active discharge location
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
for patients who are at new hampshire
 
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
hospital but are clinically stable
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
and are awaiting housing in the
 
02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:25.669 align:start position:0%
and are awaiting housing in the
community

02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
where's that physically located i i'm
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
imagining a building
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
or am i looking imagining it wrong
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
um it is physically located over at the
 
02:07:35.679 --> 02:07:36.790 align:start position:0%
um it is physically located over at the
former

02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
former
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
children's hospital the philbrook
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
building which in between
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
housed a professional licensure in the
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
board of nursing
 
02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
do you know what building i'm talking
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
about now i imagine it's on the dhhs
 
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
campus somewhere
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
it is it is it's on the um it's on
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
clinton and fruit on sort of on the
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
corner there
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what i said it was probably a
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
beautiful building in 1880
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
i think it was around a little bit later
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
than that joe was it built in the
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
60s maybe 60s or 70s
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
so this slide just represents where
 
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
the path program sort of fits in with
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
the inpatient mental health system so
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
that it is a direct discharge location
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
for us for
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
you see here the mission and the vision
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
of the path center
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
and really this program is about
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
allowing patients to be in the least
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment that they can be
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know according to what their
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
clinical needs are so
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
um folks that are referred to this
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
program are uh you know psychiatrically
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
and medically stable
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
and they literally are waiting for
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate housing but that is
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
independent housing
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
that they're waiting for so um in order
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
to not
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
again to to you know improve our
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
discharge process and and work on the
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
the back door issue the idea was that
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
the path center could move folks out of
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
and then they work um closely with
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
housing specialists within this program
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
so so i have to ask it this way are are
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
you saying that these are folks that are
 
02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be homeless and have
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go
 
02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
and so we're holding them until
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
some kind of a housing arrangement can
 
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
be found for them so they
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
sleep under a roof at night or or or are
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
you talking about a specialty kind of
 
02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.149 align:start position:0%
you talking about a specialty kind of
housing

02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
so it is specialty in that there is
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
additional programming so i would think
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
of it more of a
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
as a step down from new hampshire
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
hospital so
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
most of these patients so they have
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
achieved clinical stability they don't
 
02:09:55.119 --> 02:09:55.750 align:start position:0%
achieved clinical stability they don't
require

02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
hospital level of care anymore but they
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
are working on a bridge voucher they are
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
trying to find apartments they are
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
working on employment
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
they are needing to get connected with
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers
 
02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
so with the step down to the path
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
program they continue that work
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
and then discharge to a setting that's
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
going to allow them to continue to be
 
02:10:15.199 --> 02:10:17.350 align:start position:0%
going to allow them to continue to be
stable

02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
stable
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay but they're not necessarily
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
homeless they may have
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
their own apartment or house somewhere
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
but we're still looking to give them a
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
level of care
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
most of them have not found an apartment
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
yet but they're in the process with the
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
bridge voucher
 
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
and looking for um affordable housing
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
but i would say
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
i no i will make an exception to that we
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
have had a couple of instances where
 
02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
we've had patients discharged to the
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
path program who were
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to be returning to their parents
 
02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
going to be returning to their parents
home

02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
but they had additional work that they
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
were doing with counselors
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
and also working on employment so we
 
02:10:56.229 --> 02:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
have had that be
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you they're all are they all
 
02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
they're all coming directly from new
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
currently yes they are yep um we have
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
talked about it being a potential
 
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
um placement location for other types of
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
transitional housing that need a step
 
02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
transitional housing that need a step
down

02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
from their programs but right now we're
 
02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
keeping them full with referrals from
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
so i remember in the past
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
people from new hampshire hospital the
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
staff they're talking about
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
um people who had
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
stayed in new hampshire hospital for
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
many many years
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
and are we have we been able to move
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
some of those um clients
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
to the path program
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
seemed like there were some people who
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
had been in there for for several
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
several years
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
because there was no place for them to
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
go i i would say that that
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
the patients that are being referred to
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
path are not part of that population
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
so that population that you're talking
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
about really has
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
more special needs and an increased
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
level of service
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
so it's not at the hospital level of
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
care but path is much more um
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
more independent than that so many of
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
those folks that were waiting
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
were waiting for um programs that are
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
more like nfi
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
that are more intensive services or
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
maybe they are needing
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
a group home so that that population
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
path doesn't so much serve but path
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
definitely serves people
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
who are homeless or pursuing housing
 
02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
and that's extending their length of
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
stay so we are able to get get
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
get patients discharged quicker with
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
utilizing path beds for that very
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
specific population
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you heather um
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
i thought there were also transitional
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
housing availabilities in communities
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
around the state are those included in
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
your discussion
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
or are they overseeing by the department
 
02:13:20.239 --> 02:13:22.149 align:start position:0%
or are they overseeing by the department
or

02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
what yes yes i believe that those
 
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
residences that you're talking about are
 
02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
residences that you're talking about are
typically

02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
typically
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
either run by a contract agency like nfi
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
or some of the community mental health
 
02:13:34.079 --> 02:13:35.589 align:start position:0%
or some of the community mental health
centers

02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
centers
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
run residential programs like that and
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
those are overseen
 
02:13:41.669 --> 02:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
by the department of behavioral health
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
so they're not overseeing directly by me
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
i only oversee path but the department
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
oversees the other programs
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much so for you to
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
release a patient from the path center
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
to say something like a group home uh
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
do do do do those uh
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
sort of charitable organizations do they
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
have to comply with the federal
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
housing first policies in order that for
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
them to
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
qualify as a housing partner with you
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
so patients that are being discharged
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
from path are either
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
going to um their home with their with
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
their guardian or
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
maybe their parents or most often
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
they're going into independent housing
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
in an apartment with a bridge voucher
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
they're not typically going to another
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
um transitional housing
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
location does that make sense
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
yep and then and then do you keep any
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
stats on if any of these are veterans
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
actually i don't think we have yet but
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's a great point
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
because you know again those are
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
additional for veterans
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's a whole other path towards
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
housing that could be pursued
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
so that's definitely something we could
 
02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:56.950 align:start position:0%
so that's definitely something we could
do

02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
so again just um just so you have an
 
02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
understanding of what you know the path
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
program does and what it does not do
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
so it's transitional in nature people
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
are not living at path for
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
long periods of time they are supervised
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
for their medication
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
there are continued therapeutic
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
psychiatric services that are provided
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh there's inten really the biggest
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
thing they do is this intensive case
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
management discharge planning
 
02:15:24.310 --> 02:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
which is working towards finding housing
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
and employment
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
and then coordinating that transition to
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
the care of the community mental health
 
02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:30.390 align:start position:0%
the care of the community mental health
center

02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
center
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's very important one of the things
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
that came up when we pulled path
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
together was this question of does that
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
mean that everyone that discharges to
 
02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:38.709 align:start position:0%
mean that everyone that discharges to
path

02:15:38.709 --> 02:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
path
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
now is a concord resident and now is
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
part of riverbend
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
and they are not our goal is for
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
for these patients to get to their home
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
communities wherever that may be in the
 
02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:50.950 align:start position:0%
communities wherever that may be in the
state

02:15:50.950 --> 02:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
so that's something that the housing
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
specialists and the social workers work
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
very closely with these patients on to
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
reconnect them
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
with that community mental health center
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
we don't do
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
it sorry go ahead no i i thought you're
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
taking a break there what i was just
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to ask what the
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
youngest age of a an acceptable
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
patient or client would be if they're
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
over 18
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's certainly acceptable to to be over
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
at the path program i would say
 
02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
we've had a range of ages of referrals
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
but really anyone over 18 can can work
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
and you're obviously accepting uh all
 
02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:33.990 align:start position:0%
and you're obviously accepting uh all
genders

02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
genders
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
you're not uh do you have i'm i'm
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
thinking about the housing
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
facility at the path center and whether
 
02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:41.589 align:start position:0%
facility at the path center and whether
or not

02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
there's appropriate segregation
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
so they're all private rooms but the the
 
02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:48.629 align:start position:0%
so they're all private rooms but the the
wings

02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
wings
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
um there at the unit are co-ed um and
 
02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:52.469 align:start position:0%
um there at the unit are co-ed um and
then

02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
there are um shower and toilet
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
facilities that are you know assigned
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
have you had any incidences of of
 
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:07.589 align:start position:0%
have you had any incidences of of
harassment

02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
harassment
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
no or patients all getting along like
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
brother and sister
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of incidents with
 
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.589 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of incidents with
patients

02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
that upon discharge maybe had some
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
increase in psychiatric symptoms
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
that needed to be managed by the team
 
02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:22.709 align:start position:0%
that needed to be managed by the team
there

02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
again it's a big change from this very
 
02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment here at new
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital to then to be at the
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
path program
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of patients that have
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
been readmissions to new hampshire
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
hospital based on that
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
so we haven't had any incidents of
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
violence or anything like that but we
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
have had incidents where patients
 
02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:45.349 align:start position:0%
have had incidents where patients
destabilized

02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
destabilized
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
and needed to come back i'm just worried
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
security of of the
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
patients that are not as strong and able
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
to protect themselves in case they have
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
somebody come
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
molest them i mean if it's a co-ed wing
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
you have co-ed issues and so i'm just
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
hoping you're on top of that i think
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
it's a great point
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
our campus police are also supporting
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
the path center
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so we have close communication with
 
02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:15.429 align:start position:0%
um so we have close communication with
them

02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
they are at the ready if there's
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
anything needed it's from a security
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
standpoint the other thing is each of
 
02:18:23.669 --> 02:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
these patient rooms are private rooms
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
and um they are locked the resident has
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
the key
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
to their room and um a step you know
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
staff has a key to get into the room but
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise there is the ability
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
um to have absolute privacy so when
 
02:18:37.349 --> 02:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
their door is shut it's secure and it's
 
02:18:37.359 --> 02:18:40.629 align:start position:0%
their door is shut it's secure and it's
locked

02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
and we also have staff there 24 7 so
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
an ongoing level of supervision all the
 
02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:51.589 align:start position:0%
an ongoing level of supervision all the
time

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
so this is the team um the leadership
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
team that's
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
covering for path so you can see joe and
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
i are on this slide ellen the point is
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
our chief operating officer and so she's
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
very involved from the aspect of making
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
support services are in place as needed
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
and then our new directorate path is
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
debbie robinson and
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
she's a long-standing state employee
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
and she just started last month but
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.349 --> 02:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
so you asked about about data and we
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
just really started collecting that it's
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
so new
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
still that i think it's going to be
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
really interesting to look at this year
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
over year but
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
for now this slide just shows you our
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
gradual ramp up
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
to get to um you know
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
occupancy here at at the facility so
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
um we did go a little bit low and slow
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
over the first couple of months but i
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
think that was
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
important and that was also related to
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
us filling positions
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
so to maintain safety we sort of had to
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's too soon to say what the
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
length of stay
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
will be that that's what this slide
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
represents just based on
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
um our short period of time of
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
collecting data
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
um but like the slide notes you know
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
any or all of these days could have been
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
incurred at new hampshire hospital had
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
so in summary yeah no
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
earlier you guys had a a
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
a national benchmark for the average
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
cost of a psychiatric hospital
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
per patient day and i'm just curious if
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's an equivalent benchmark
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
for this facility or if you've
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
begun worrying about calculating your
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
per patient per day
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
costs yeah we have started doing that
 
02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:53.830 align:start position:0%
costs yeah we have started doing that
and

02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
and joe can speak to that i think where
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
we were trying to show
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know where the value was in this
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
program was in comparing it to what it
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
cost per day for a patient to be here
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire hospital compared to at
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
the path program
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
joe do you want to talk about the daily
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
rate for path
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
sure um so there is no uh
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
real clear or solid benchmark that we've
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
been able to identify path serves a
 
02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:19.429 align:start position:0%
been able to identify path serves a
relatively

02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
niche population um but to heather's
 
02:21:22.399 --> 02:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
niche population um but to heather's
point

02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
in this presentation in a few slides
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
from now we do have that uh
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
that cost per bed day benchmark uh
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
compared to the national benchmark new
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital's cost
 
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
and then the cost per bed day at the
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
path center to give you a sense of
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
um kind of the the cost benefit
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
trade-off of having that patient be at
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
the hospital versus being at the path
 
02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:47.030 align:start position:0%
the hospital versus being at the path
center

02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
so this is a timeline of of really the
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
work that we did around opening
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
this program it was a pretty huge
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
accomplishment again
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
um in the context of the past year um
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
here at new hampshire hospital and
 
02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:00.790 align:start position:0%
here at new hampshire hospital and
everything

02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we have um sort of overcome and
 
02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:04.469 align:start position:0%
that we have um sort of overcome and
challenges

02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
but you can see um it really was
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
over the over the course of the summer
 
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
um in 2020
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
um got the funding built the accounting
 
02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
um got the funding built the accounting
unit

02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
created positions started recruiting
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
like crazy
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
um the renovation of the facility was um
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
huge you know that was that we we needed
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
to work
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
very very quickly um to get contractors
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
in there and get that work done
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
um and then ultimately in september we
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
got our approval from the fire marshal
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
to occupy and we opened
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
and and as you can see in the previous
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
the slide just represents our challenges
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
short term and long term
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately what we would like path to be
 
02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:52.469 align:start position:0%
ultimately what we would like path to be
is

02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
um a structure to be replicated
 
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
so we thought you know if this is um if
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
if we can build this model you know can
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
we duplicate this over and over again
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully with partners like community
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
mental health centers
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
that can get more of these locations
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that there is going to be
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
some variability
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the level of service that's provided
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
at the path program it is definitely a
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
step down from new hampshire hospital
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
we do provide service but there are a
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
number of patients that we have here
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
that are not appropriate for path
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
because they need a little bit more or
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
they need a longer
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
stay in in a housing situation that has
 
02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:36.630 align:start position:0%
stay in in a housing situation that has
support

02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:39.990 align:start position:0%
support
representative

02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you actually my my question was
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
where are you going to try to replicate
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
this in other some other areas
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
have you identified any areas yet in the
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
we haven't identified a specific area
 
02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
yet but the
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know our feeling is that um
 
02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:03.750 align:start position:0%
you know our feeling is that um
certainly

02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
um in the lakes and in the north country
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
that it seems like that there could be
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
good utilization in those areas
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
um but you know census census-wise we do
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
a large you know population that is in
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
the manchester area and nashua
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
there are other transitional housing
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
options that are already there though
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so i think it really will come down
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
who can we partner with you know for in
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
particular from potentially a cmhc
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
um and work closely with in an area
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
where it's needed but
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think our general feeling was perhaps
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
lakes region or the north country
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just soon to say great
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
so i think this slide speaks to your
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
your question
 
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
um chairman edwards just around you know
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
how do we how can we figure out value
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
here of what we're doing um
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
so joe spoke to this there there really
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
aren't any benchmarks but what we can do
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
um is try to do some calculations based
 
02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:06.630 align:start position:0%
um is try to do some calculations based
on

02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that value of the patient you know
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
not being here at the hospital level of
 
02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:13.190 align:start position:0%
not being here at the hospital level of
care

02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
so i think this slide does a good job in
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
showing that
 
02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
so like a green eye shade question um
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
does that 729 include the amortization
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
of all the renovations and one-time
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
licensing costs
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
or is that just um direct
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
operating costs i believe those are
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
operating costs correct joe yeah
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct that is correct okay so
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
if we wanted a fully loaded number we'd
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
the amortization of the renovations
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
would that have a material difference on
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
that number
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would if i remember
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
incorrectly i believe our renovation
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
budget was 170 thousand
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
so it it wasn't so much a massive
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
renovation or overhaul of the space
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
it was more about the timeline we had to
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
do it in
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
so it was you know uh getting numerous
 
02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
contractors in the space at the exact
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
same time
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
and really trying to stand this program
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't see whose hand went up first
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
but representative nordgren here on top
 
02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair um so this
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
page would be nice if we also could see
 
02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
what the cost comparison would be if
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
these people were kept
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the state hospital
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
so this is obviously like a step down
 
02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:39.510 align:start position:0%
so this is obviously like a step down
unit

02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it's costing less which is freeing
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
up beds in the state hospital
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
it'd be good if we could just see what
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
the comparison would be
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
for all these numbers across the board
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah you know i think that
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
it also will be helpful to have another
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
year you know of operating
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we can really sort of drill down to
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
and see if there are opportunities to
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost even more this is such a
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
young program
 
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
um and in standing things up you know i
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
think i think it costs a little more in
 
02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:13.190 align:start position:0%
think i think it costs a little more in
those

02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
initial you know four five six months so
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
um that'll be we'll be able to be much
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
more accurate
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
um in this next year but you know you
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
know as it stands now we're looking at
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know really cutting in half what it
 
02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:29.349 align:start position:0%
you know really cutting in half what it
costs

02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
to take care of these folks you know
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
compared to if they were in new
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
roughly it's a brilliant initiative
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so representative walner do
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
no i just needed to lower my hand i'm
 
02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:52.710 align:start position:0%
no i just needed to lower my hand i'm
sorry

02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.710 --> 02:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
so so this is the slide again that we're
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
asked to you know show what would happen
 
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
with an
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
increase or a decrease um let me devil's
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
advocate you on this first one
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
sure so so this path model is brilliant
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's helping us uh cut costs
 
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
um so if we were to replicate it why
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the money
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
already be there in the new hampshire
 
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
hospital budget to
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
to because this is a cheaper model why
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
would this be
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't understand the question
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
right i can i can cover it
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
it would still be an increase to the
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
total budget because we still need the
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
total number of beds at new hampshire
 
02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:39.030 align:start position:0%
total number of beds at new hampshire
hospital

02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
so we're not decreasing beds at the
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
hospital as much as we're
 
02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
decreasing the burden around the
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
inflow and outflow of the hospital
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
all right i understand
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
and as far as the decrease where you
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
know there's this five percent
 
02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
i just to explain that a little bit more
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
um where we wrote that we would decrease
 
02:29:02.479 --> 02:29:03.670 align:start position:0%
um where we wrote that we would decrease
capacity

02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's important because it's so
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
small um
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
of a unit and it that staffing is so
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
small and already so lean
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
um that it is just right sized as it is
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
um so you know a decrease in staffing
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
would represent
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
us you know definitely um not being able
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
to take care of as many people over
 
02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:24.710 align:start position:0%
to take care of as many people over
there

02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
so without making any promises without
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
making any promises the way i look at
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
this path centers is a
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a great innovation
 
02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:33.670 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a great innovation
experiment

02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
experiment
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
that should be allowed to proceed
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
because if you're showing us
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
a way forward where we can deal with
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
these other problems at a significantly
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
lower cost then that's that's brilliant
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's what we need so i
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't i wouldn't want to
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
come after this
 
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we're excited about
 
02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
this project it's been
 
02:29:59.270 --> 02:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
um just a great great challenge and to
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
see it pay off as it has
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know with discharges is uh it's
 
02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
you know with discharges is uh it's
pretty

02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
powerful i think so
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
this speaks to again just the number of
 
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
positions this center employs 35
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh staff across three shifts seven days
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
a week
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
essentially they're all direct care
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
how many of those are actual rns and our
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
rns the most senior level of nursing
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
care that you have on site
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we have um two full-time rns and i
 
02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
think a part-time
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
rn those are really the only nursing
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
staff that we have
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
then we have a compliment of mental
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
health workers um
 
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
that are there direct care and and again
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
helping doing you know therapeutic
 
02:30:42.479 --> 02:30:42.950 align:start position:0%
helping doing you know therapeutic
groups

02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
groups
 
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
not the mental health workers no but the
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
remainder at least half of the staff
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
that are over there are masters level
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
social workers
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
and um case managers and housing
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
specialists it's a very
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
so someday not now that it'd be
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
interesting just to see
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
um sort of the diversified staff that
 
02:31:15.630 --> 02:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
you've done it's kind of the
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary approach that you've
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
used to build that
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure not urgent just in months
 
02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
for coming yeah so really the staffing
 
02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:26.830 align:start position:0%
for coming yeah so really the staffing
model

02:31:26.830 --> 02:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
model
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh so joe do you want to talk about this
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
budget comparison
 
02:31:39.349 --> 02:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
sure so um in the current biennium as we
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier this is really
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
created through an appropriation from
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 4
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
so we use 2.7 million dollars to create
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
the program in the current biennium
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
and the future biennium we are we do
 
02:31:51.439 --> 02:31:52.230 align:start position:0%
and the future biennium we are we do
anticipate

02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
earning some revenue so quite frankly we
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate earning some revenue in the
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
current biennium as well um we've just
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh we're working through some systems
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
issues with that but
 
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
um but we can bill for a per diem rate
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
for transitional housing we will receive
 
02:32:14.309 --> 02:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
the an in-kind payment for that so
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
essentially the
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
the federal share we won't make medicaid
 
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
pay us state dollars because we're all
 
02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
so we do anticipate being able to earn
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
some revenue there um and then we will
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
be charging uh residents uh
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
some rent uh and we're working on
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
developing that program
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh we didn't do it out of the
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
gate initially um but
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
we're pretty close to implementing that
 
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
practice and the the intent is to have
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
it be cheaper
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
obviously than the cost of care at the
 
02:32:43.359 --> 02:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
obviously than the cost of care at the
hospital

02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
but also kind of reflect that we are
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
providing a housing service and so
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
we anticipate charging some rents to
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
patients as well
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
i think there's also the psychological
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
that people value things that they have
 
02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
to pay for
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
themselves you know so they
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
get more buy-in i would imagine if they
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
actually have to buy
 
02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
in sure yeah
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely i mean that's i think a
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
critical point for us and that
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
this is a step down um patients they
 
02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
and they should you know as able pay
 
02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:19.429 align:start position:0%
and they should you know as able pay
rent

02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
rent
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
but also um incentivizing them to find
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
their own housing too
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
right i mean this is not long-term um
 
02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:27.190 align:start position:0%
right i mean this is not long-term um
free

02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
free
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
housing this is something that is a
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
process that the patient's going to work
 
02:33:30.479 --> 02:33:31.429 align:start position:0%
process that the patient's going to work
through

02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i just want to also add to that 7.1
 
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:34.550 align:start position:0%
and i just want to also add to that 7.1
million

02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
dollar general fund amount that's
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect um i need to
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
to revisit that but the total cost of
 
02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
the program uh
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
is just shy of uh in the 2022-23
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
biennium is just shy of four million
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
dollars i think it's 3.8 million
 
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i will i will revise that and get a
 
02:33:53.349 --> 02:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
an updated copy for you
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
and again these are the this is the
 
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that's listed
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay are we ready for the briefing book
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
the budget briefing book
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the conclusion of the
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
presentation on the path
 
02:34:11.429 --> 02:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
program on my end i don't know if you
 
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
need to open something joe i can stop
 
02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:21.190 align:start position:0%
need to open something joe i can stop
sharing

02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
so let's see so here is the budget book
 
02:34:27.469 --> 02:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
it's page
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
1144. it is the first accounting unit
 
02:34:30.479 --> 02:34:31.830 align:start position:0%
1144. it is the first accounting unit
within

02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
within
 
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
agency 94 and i'm happy that activity
 
02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:39.190 align:start position:0%
agency 94 and i'm happy that activity
number

02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yeah accounting unit
 
02:34:52.399 --> 02:34:53.349 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yeah accounting unit
correct

02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
i see it listed as community residents
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
yep when we created the accounting unit
 
02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't know we were going to name the
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
um so uh pretty similar to
 
02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
to other uh slides you know the majority
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
of this this cost
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
is uh relative to staffing and payroll
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the 2021 biennium we did have some
 
02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
one-time costs that we
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
um have excluded from our budget request
 
02:35:38.550 --> 02:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward so those were things like
 
02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know our initial purchase of
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
furniture um
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
the renovations to the building um
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
so we did reduce those budget lines you
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
can see uh as an example class 48
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
um you know we had 193 000
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
budgeted for for that and moving forward
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be
 
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
um you know closer to twenty six
 
02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
thousand so um we've pulled out those
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
one time costs
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
um and really the rest of the majority
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the cost here is relative to staffing
 
02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:11.110 align:start position:0%
of the cost here is relative to staffing
um

02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
and yeah i'm happy to take
 
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
any questions okay
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:24.870 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm looking at heat
 
02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:32.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm looking at heat
electricity

02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
and water and i'm thinking this is you
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
know something like the size of a home
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh maybe twice the size of a home and
 
02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
those those uh
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
eat electricity and water 100 and some
 
02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
thousand seems awfully high
 
02:36:50.230 --> 02:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
for just providing those two
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
so i apologize i didn't mean to cut you
 
02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:56.070 align:start position:0%
so i apologize i didn't mean to cut you
off

02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
um so that value represents the cost of
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
so it is a 16 bed program um but
 
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh but the entire building is um is
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
is kind of um operated by new hampshire
 
02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
hospital now or
 
02:37:17.670 --> 02:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
our kind of collective entity um
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
so and that number i believe was
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
provided to us
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:27.270 --> 02:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
so i i don't beat you up on your average
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
that 750
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
average but if you take that annual cost
 
02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:32.469 align:start position:0%
average but if you take that annual cost
of

02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
water and electricity and divide it by
 
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
divided into that that seems to me like
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
that would challenge your 750 number
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm saying it's it's just
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh and i i don't know how you get a 750
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
dollar per
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
patient is that per patient per day or
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
per patient
 
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
per patient per day
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm off in my head by an
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude it's okay
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
any other oh i'm sorry representative uh
 
02:38:16.319 --> 02:38:17.190 align:start position:0%
any other oh i'm sorry representative uh
uh

02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
walnut you had your hand up yes and
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
this is just kind of a simple one i'm
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
sure you haven't
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's an explanation for it so i'm
 
02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
looking in
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
um 2021
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
and under um line 60
 
02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
benefits you have a half a million
 
02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:37.670 align:start position:0%
benefits you have a half a million
dollars

02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
but yet i don't think we had any
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
personnel i don't
 
02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
so how would we pay what were we paying
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
benefits on
 
02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
sure so great question um and there's
 
02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
actually two points i'd like to make
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
there so to answer your question
 
02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:52.630 align:start position:0%
there so to answer your question
directly

02:38:52.630 --> 02:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
these positions because they were
 
02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
created outside of the budgeting process
 
02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
are considered eight t positions and so
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
they show up in that class 50
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
line there so you can see that there's a
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of payroll in
 
02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
class 50.
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
those are technically full-time
 
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
positions but they're they're temporary
 
02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:08.710 align:start position:0%
positions but they're they're temporary
until

02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're approved in a budgeting cycle
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
so so there's that and then i also want
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
to just mention the difference between
 
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
class 60 for 21 and 22
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
is is that 21 is not an entire year
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
so so that budget does not represent a a
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
full year's worth of cost
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
per se thank you yep
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um so
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
you said 750 is the per day
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
cost per client what is the per day cost
 
02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
at the state hospital uh it is
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
um i believe in the upcoming biennium
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:09.990 --> 02:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh and then your hand is still up
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative nordran
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh and now representative weiler your
 
02:40:15.190 --> 02:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
hand is back up sir
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
yes i'm looking at um benefits paying a
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
million and a half
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
pay for the 35 people and then a million
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
to benefit so it's like
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know 60 percent of the
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
cost of an employee again in benefits
 
02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:31.190 align:start position:0%
cost of an employee again in benefits
seems

02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
seems
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
awfully high but i know we're very
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
generous in our benefits but that's
 
02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:35.910 align:start position:0%
generous in our benefits but that's
still

02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
those numbers are set by the department
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
of administrative services
 
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
we we have no control over the benefits
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
number so
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
so sorry i i think we've seen that in
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
other departments at 60 percent
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
ratio i think that's just one we've got
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
to talk to das because that's one of the
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
big figures that goes across the whole
 
02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
state we've got to try to find out why
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
those benefits
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
are so high i know some of it's the
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
retirement system has
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
done a lousy job of investing and so has
 
02:41:08.399 --> 02:41:08.710 align:start position:0%
done a lousy job of investing and so has
the

02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
self-insured done a lousy job of getting
 
02:41:12.389 --> 02:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
the third party
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
administrator those are things we've got
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
to look at as a big picture for the
 
02:41:16.070 --> 02:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
whole budget
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
so um are there any other questions from
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
the committee on
 
02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
so i'm not seeing any let's uh let's
 
02:41:32.479 --> 02:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
so i'm not seeing any let's uh let's
give

02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
the public an opportunity if uh somebody
 
02:41:37.030 --> 02:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
on the attendee list wants to raise
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
their hand to
 
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
add some useful knowledge for us
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
or to make a salient point we'd be
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
so so there's one by mr norton
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it was just that last time i
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
neglected to introduce
 
02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
myself appropriately i'm ken norton i'm
 
02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
the executive director for nami new
 
02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:16.870 align:start position:0%
the executive director for nami new
hampshire

02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
the national alliance on mental illness
 
02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
and i am registered as a lobbyist on
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of nami new hampshire
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for correcting that i think
 
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's just important that we know you're
 
02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
you're obviously a well-respected
 
02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:31.030 align:start position:0%
you're obviously a well-respected
individual

02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
but it's good to know um that you're a
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
lobbyist thank you
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
you have anything else to add on this
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
part i i mean i really commend the
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner and
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh heather and her team i think that
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of
 
02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
forethought we would be in serious
 
02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
trouble with emergency department
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
boarding for adults without the path
 
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
program it's definitely helped
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
alleviate that in a big way what do you
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
think about the potential for
 
02:42:58.230 --> 02:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
replication are we going to run in
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
into the same manpower problems when we
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
try to get out to the
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
lakes region um it continues to be an
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
issue for sure
 
02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
um but i you know again i think that um
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
having some ability to look at
 
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
credentialing standards and
 
02:43:15.269 --> 02:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
you know well-trained and
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
well-supervised staff
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
that aren't necessarily licensed folks
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
can be a big help
 
02:43:26.950 --> 02:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
ms mcquinn i think you're going to say
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
something mcgowan i
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry i'm horrible with names i
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
got heather but i'm trying to be more
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
formal you know i used to be a smith and
 
02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
it was a lot easier back then but it's
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
heather moquin and uh no i was just
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
going to echo what
 
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
what ken was saying i think we have to
 
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
get really creative
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
um throughout the state around these
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
workforce issues
 
02:43:53.349 --> 02:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
um that that really needs some serious
 
02:43:53.359 --> 02:43:55.990 align:start position:0%
um that that really needs some serious
attention

02:43:55.990 --> 02:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
so i just want to throw a crazy idea out
 
02:43:59.429 --> 02:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
at you
 
02:44:01.469 --> 02:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
and that would be uh internal
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
virtualization of the operation
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
meaning the exploitation of
 
02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
commercial off-the-shelf technologies to
 
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:11.110 align:start position:0%
commercial off-the-shelf technologies to
provide

02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
cameras and audio and so that maybe some
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
supervision of the of the wings could be
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
done remotely without having
 
02:44:24.630 --> 02:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
on-site on and present people
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
just a crazy idea from an old
 
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
telemedicine guy
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
02:44:34.230 --> 02:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
not seeing any more questions or
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
comments from the attendees
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
i i think we should probably take a
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
lunch break here we got two more areas
 
02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'd still like to finish at three
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh last time we broke for 45 minutes or
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
is there anyone thinking that was too
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
much time oh wait a second
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative waller go ahead
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
well i'm sorry i so in in house bill 2
 
02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
which i are we going to get the form are
 
02:45:03.510 --> 02:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
we going to get the final uh
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
i think our expectation is that we're
 
02:45:12.870 --> 02:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to get it today
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
um but obviously i'm not positive about
 
02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:16.469 align:start position:0%
um but obviously i'm not positive about
that

02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay well i'm looking at the draft and
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
so i would just like to know if we're
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to have someone
 
02:45:26.469 --> 02:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
come forward to do some explanation for
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
us because
 
02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
this is around the 60 bed for forensic
 
02:45:32.309 --> 02:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
that is to be built on new hampshire
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
hospital grounds
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it isn't only in house bill 2. i
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have found it in the the
 
02:45:42.479 --> 02:45:43.110 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have found it in the the
budget

02:45:43.110 --> 02:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:45:45.190 --> 02:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
actually so i just wondered if we were
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to have someone come forward
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
to give us some explanation about that
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
and where we are
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the planning of that um
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
karen i i don't know if um you have
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
anything to add to that i was just going
 
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
um there has been a work group um so
 
02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
even last year there was some study
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
around just
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
potential sites um here on the campus so
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
there was some work that was done with
 
02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:12.710 align:start position:0%
there was some work that was done with
that

02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
and there's been um some ongoing
 
02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
and there's been um some ongoing
discussions

02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
on the part of das
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
and commissioner arlinghaus has been
 
02:46:22.630 --> 02:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
doing some research
 
02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
and that's that's as far as my knowledge
 
02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:25.910 align:start position:0%
and that's that's as far as my knowledge
goes

02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
goes
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
at this point i don't know karen if you
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
have anything else
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
i can just add as far as the
 
02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation the appropriation in the
 
02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021 budget was non-lapsing
 
02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
so that's the appropriation that's
 
02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be used as this project
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
moves forward
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i know that there is an intent on
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's part as you can see from
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
the hb2 language
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
to move forward and on the department's
 
02:46:48.399 --> 02:46:49.349 align:start position:0%
to move forward and on the department's
part

02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
part
 
02:46:53.830 --> 02:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're getting ready to go
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
to lunch
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
so um i'm proposing about 45 minutes
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
was that too long or too short were any
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:47:09.910 --> 02:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to offer a counter proposal
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
30 minutes i'd say i got to be out of
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
here by three
 
02:47:17.429 --> 02:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay so um let's say that we'll be back
 
02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
at 1 15.
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
and until then we'll reset for lunch 1
 
02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:32.830 align:start position:0%
and until then we'll reset for lunch 1
[Music]

02:47:32.830 --> 02:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.840 --> 03:14:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
15.

03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:22.840 --> 03:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:14:51.750 --> 03:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
mr ripple i see your email about maybe
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
using wednesday if we need to
 
03:14:57.910 --> 03:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm kind of optimistic we can finish
 
03:14:57.920 --> 03:14:58.870 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm kind of optimistic we can finish
today

03:14:58.870 --> 03:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay um it just saves
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
the presenters the scheduling problem of
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
having to come back sure
 
03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
no that's fine i do think they're they
 
03:15:15.269 --> 03:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
may be ready to come back if needed but
 
03:15:26.790 --> 03:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:30.070 --> 03:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
so representative irf may zoom
 
03:15:33.190 --> 03:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
as he's uh literally zooming in his car
 
03:15:37.590 --> 03:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:40.710 --> 03:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative representative wallner
 
03:15:43.830 --> 03:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
are not back just yet representative
 
03:15:47.190 --> 03:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
walner's here but her video won't start
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
because it says you cannot start because
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
the host has disabled you
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:03.190 --> 03:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
let me try to fix that
 
03:16:06.309 --> 03:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
you know i didn't tell him to do that oh
 
03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:12.950 --> 03:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
no i turned everybody's video off at uh
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
at lunch
 
03:16:17.590 --> 03:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's probably a good idea
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
um okay so representative weiler is here
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
sir would you would you remind me what
 
03:16:25.269 --> 03:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
your drop dead time is when
 
03:16:27.429 --> 03:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
when when do when would you like us to
 
03:16:29.590 --> 03:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
be done
 
03:16:32.950 --> 03:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
i have a gopher meeting at three
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay and you probably need a few minutes
 
03:16:37.269 --> 03:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
just to
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
transition so i have the same this is
 
03:16:43.190 --> 03:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
mary jane i have the same meeting so
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
if maybe what ken do you think maybe
 
03:16:45.120 --> 03:16:46.309 align:start position:0%
if maybe what ken do you think maybe
like

03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:16:52.150 --> 03:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it'll probably take me a while to
 
03:16:55.990 --> 03:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
find the link me too that's what i'm
 
03:16:57.190 --> 03:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
just thinking
 
03:16:59.670 --> 03:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right okay well very good
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's her that's our time schedule
 
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
let's let's see if it can happen but uh
 
03:17:04.630 --> 03:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
mr ripple did
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
allow for us to continue on wednesday if
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%

a couple presentations a very similar
 
03:18:03.429 --> 03:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
setup with our
 
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
powerpoint slides here this is our
 
03:18:07.349 --> 03:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
agenda which is
 
03:18:10.229 --> 03:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
basically the same as the last couple on
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
your next slide
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see again our contact information
 
03:18:13.680 --> 03:18:14.630 align:start position:0%
you'll see again our contact information
um

03:18:14.630 --> 03:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:15.990 --> 03:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know heather is the ceo of new
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital which is also my
 
03:18:20.950 --> 03:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
direct report and then joe is the cfo
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
for both glencliff home and new
 
03:18:24.389 --> 03:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
then trying to stick with the moving
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
fast forward we have our overview and
 
03:18:29.429 --> 03:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
delivery system
 
03:18:31.510 --> 03:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
um some brief history for those of you
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
that are not familiar with glencliff
 
03:18:32.880 --> 03:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
that are not familiar with glencliff
home

03:18:33.990 --> 03:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
we started in 1909 um actually 1906 is
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
when the legislation was first passed
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
but we had our first patients in 1909
 
03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
um as a tv sanitarium uh because back
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
then um treatment for tv was fresh
 
03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
mountain air and sunshine and we are
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
located on the
 
03:18:50.309 --> 03:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
side of mount moose lock i'm up here in
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
the north country
 
03:18:54.229 --> 03:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
then in the 70s when there was now
 
03:18:55.750 --> 03:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
treatment for tb
 
03:18:58.309 --> 03:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
we the legislature at the time decided
 
03:19:00.150 --> 03:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
to transition us into a
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
nursing home that specializes in serving
 
03:19:04.469 --> 03:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
individuals with psychiatric
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
or developmental disability issues and
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
actually at that time
 
03:19:10.710 --> 03:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
it was close to when the state school in
 
03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
laconia was closing and we've got a fair
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
number of patients from there
 
03:19:16.229 --> 03:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
in additional there was a building on
 
03:19:18.389 --> 03:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
the main campus of dhhs and conquered
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
their building
 
03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
which had over three hundred beds very
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
similar model as uh glencoefizz and at
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
that time it was
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
decided to downsize that facility and
 
03:19:29.429 --> 03:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
relocate a number of people
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
here to coincliff so
 
03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
we serve part of the back door as the
 
03:19:37.830 --> 03:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
term we've been using today
 
03:19:40.229 --> 03:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
solution from new hampshire hospital we
 
03:19:41.910 --> 03:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
do have a long wait list which i'll get
 
03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
to on the
 
03:19:45.190 --> 03:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
future slides but we take priority from
 
03:19:46.469 --> 03:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital it's actually we
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
had it
 
03:19:49.030 --> 03:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
added to law that new hampshire hospital
 
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
gets priority for any beds that are
 
03:19:51.120 --> 03:19:52.389 align:start position:0%
gets priority for any beds that are
available

03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:19:54.550 --> 03:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
all right on the next slide you'll see
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
where we fit in
 
03:19:57.510 --> 03:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
again it's demonstrating that we are
 
03:19:59.110 --> 03:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
part of the discharge
 
03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
process for new hampshire hospital
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward and then our
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
is to move people back into the
 
03:20:09.429 --> 03:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
community as well
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
which speaks to our mission you know
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
continuing with service for
 
03:20:14.790 --> 03:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
development mental and mentally ill
 
03:20:16.469 --> 03:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
population in a home-like atmosphere an
 
03:20:18.150 --> 03:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
emphasis on independence dignity
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
acceptance and i do like to speak here
 
03:20:20.800 --> 03:20:21.349 align:start position:0%
acceptance and i do like to speak here
that

03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
the real key word for our population is
 
03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:25.269 align:start position:0%
the real key word for our population is
acceptance

03:20:25.269 --> 03:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
acceptance
 
03:20:27.190 --> 03:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
our folks have had challenges their
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
whole lives now they have medical
 
03:20:30.309 --> 03:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
challenges on top of their mental
 
03:20:30.950 --> 03:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
illness or
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
developmental disability and have been
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
in and out of new hampshire hospital
 
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
um in some successful placements in the
 
03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:39.269 align:start position:0%
um in some successful placements in the
communities

03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
often a lot of people come to us where
 
03:20:42.070 --> 03:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
they've been living in a group home or
 
03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
living in their own apartment dealing
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
very well with their
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia but now they have copd or
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
they have brittle diabetes and they have
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
other medical needs
 
03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
which is just compounded by their mental
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
illness so they need additional support
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
our long-term vision uh is basically the
 
03:20:58.469 --> 03:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
residents will live a full life
 
03:20:59.750 --> 03:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and gain independence by overcoming
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
their challenges and developing the
 
03:21:02.469 --> 03:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
skills to move back into their preferred
 
03:21:02.479 --> 03:21:04.229 align:start position:0%
skills to move back into their preferred
community

03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:21:05.830 --> 03:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
and on the next side unless there's
 
03:21:08.229 --> 03:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
questions sorry for going too fast
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
i do have a question there on your
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
previous slide
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
um and and you've kind of said it twice
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
the vision um i
 
03:21:22.950 --> 03:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay so in in practical
 
03:21:25.990 --> 03:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
effect is this really an aspirational
 
03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
effect is this really an aspirational
vision

03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
vision
 
03:21:30.389 --> 03:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
given that my sense of this population
 
03:21:33.750 --> 03:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
is is there kind of um for lack of a
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
better word
 
03:21:36.630 --> 03:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know set in their ways they're
 
03:21:38.710 --> 03:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
they're elderly they have psychiatric
 
03:21:38.720 --> 03:21:39.990 align:start position:0%
they're elderly they have psychiatric
problems

03:21:39.990 --> 03:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
problems
 
03:21:42.790 --> 03:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're probably really not gonna go
 
03:21:44.870 --> 03:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
back home and and just live a normal
 
03:21:44.880 --> 03:21:45.670 align:start position:0%
back home and and just live a normal
life

03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:21:49.030 --> 03:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
or am i wrong uh you're not fully wrong
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
um we in a future slide you'll see we've
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
been able to discharge 26
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
people in the last three years back to
 
03:21:58.469 --> 03:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
the community or to a group home or to
 
03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
another nursing home
 
03:22:03.030 --> 03:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
um but right now i believe we have
 
03:22:05.750 --> 03:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
26 people actively working on being
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
discharged back to the community now
 
03:22:09.030 --> 03:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
that might take a year that might take
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
two years either for them to develop the
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
skill sets that they need to be
 
03:22:12.479 --> 03:22:13.349 align:start position:0%
skill sets that they need to be
independent

03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
independent
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
or for us to find placement because we
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
have the same challenges if not more
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
challenging than new hampshire hospital
 
03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:19.269 align:start position:0%
challenging than new hampshire hospital
does

03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
finding housing because all of our folks
 
03:22:24.070 --> 03:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
need some additional medical help
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
where we have been successful in
 
03:22:27.750 --> 03:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
discharging people is to
 
03:22:29.190 --> 03:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
either group home settings that have
 
03:22:31.510 --> 03:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
been set up with a medical model
 
03:22:34.309 --> 03:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
or into home situations um like elder
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
care so a family agrees to take one of
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
our residents
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
into their home and provide services
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
through that way
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's very specialized to the individual
 
03:22:49.190 --> 03:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that's about 20 percent of our
 
03:22:51.030 --> 03:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
residents are actively working on going
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
back into the community
 
03:22:54.870 --> 03:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
um however a large portion as you say we
 
03:22:55.830 --> 03:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
are a nursing home
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so you know people are coming to us
 
03:22:59.750 --> 03:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
with some severe medical challenges on
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
top of their mental illness
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that does make it challenging for
 
03:23:05.750 --> 03:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
them to move out and quite honestly
 
03:23:07.590 --> 03:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
a vast majority of our folks don't want
 
03:23:08.950 --> 03:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
to go back to the community
 
03:23:11.349 --> 03:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
they have tried and failed before and
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
they found a real homeless community
 
03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:13.910 align:start position:0%
they found a real homeless community
here

03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:23:16.950 --> 03:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
so we are required by cms to ask the
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
residents every three months if they're
 
03:23:19.750 --> 03:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
interested in moving back to the
 
03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:20.469 align:start position:0%
interested in moving back to the
community

03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
and typically it's about 20 to 30
 
03:23:24.630 --> 03:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
percent say yes but the rest are
 
03:23:25.990 --> 03:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
more than happy to be here and their
 
03:23:27.269 --> 03:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
families and guardians are also very
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
happy to have
 
03:23:30.070 --> 03:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
have them here in a safe structured
 
03:23:30.080 --> 03:23:31.750 align:start position:0%
have them here in a safe structured
situation

03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
so that would imply and i'm not trying
 
03:23:35.190 --> 03:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
to be morbid
 
03:23:37.030 --> 03:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
but i just want to understand your
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
setting that would
 
03:23:40.870 --> 03:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
that would apply that a very large
 
03:23:40.880 --> 03:23:42.150 align:start position:0%
that would apply that a very large
percentage

03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
will be discharged into hospice care
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
or or just uh death
 
03:23:51.190 --> 03:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
you are correct we do hospice care here
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
um you know so think of us as a nursing
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
home um
 
03:23:56.229 --> 03:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
we're very similar situation as the the
 
03:23:57.269 --> 03:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
county homes
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
except for who we serve uh and yes we
 
03:24:03.190 --> 03:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
refer to it as celestial discharge
 
03:24:04.950 --> 03:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
when someone passionately say that term
 
03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
again celestial discharge
 
03:24:10.630 --> 03:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
when someone passes away this is a nice
 
03:24:11.429 --> 03:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
way of saying
 
03:24:13.670 --> 03:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
they died you never heard that term we
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
made it out here
 
03:24:16.950 --> 03:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're very unique up here in the north
 
03:24:16.960 --> 03:24:19.590 align:start position:0%
we're very unique up here in the north
country

03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:22.229 --> 03:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh moving on so again a little more
 
03:24:22.239 --> 03:24:23.030 align:start position:0%
uh moving on so again a little more
history

03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
history
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
um we are located up north we're 69
 
03:24:26.399 --> 03:24:27.190 align:start position:0%
um we are located up north we're 69
miles

03:24:27.190 --> 03:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
miles
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
northwest of concord um on the side of
 
03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
mount mooselok and technically we're in
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
the town of benton but you can't get
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
there from here
 
03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's why we're called glencliff home
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
because the closest village is glencliff
 
03:24:38.309 --> 03:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
which is part of
 
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
the town of warren we provide a full
 
03:24:43.269 --> 03:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
continuum of services like any other
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
03:24:47.830 --> 03:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
including medical social services
 
03:24:49.990 --> 03:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much anything that an individual
 
03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:50.870 align:start position:0%
pretty much anything that an individual
needs

03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
needs
 
03:24:52.630 --> 03:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
part of what makes glenn cliff unique is
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we are self-sustaining campus we
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
are off the grid
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's how we were originally built we
 
03:25:00.389 --> 03:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
have a water wheel that produces about
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
30 35 of our electrical power we
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
actually have a capital project to
 
03:25:06.389 --> 03:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
double that
 
03:25:07.830 --> 03:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
and when the water wheel just for an
 
03:25:09.190 --> 03:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
example of how useful that is when the
 
03:25:11.190 --> 03:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
water wheel is functioning we save 100
 
03:25:12.229 --> 03:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
gallons of diesel
 
03:25:14.630 --> 03:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the generators every day which is a
 
03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
significant savings
 
03:25:17.429 --> 03:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
we're also working on adding steam
 
03:25:19.349 --> 03:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
turbines because our campus
 
03:25:22.630 --> 03:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
is heated using steam heat and we
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
about eight maybe 10 years ago we
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
transitioned to a biomass
 
03:25:29.030 --> 03:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
generation so we burn wood chips to
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
create all of our heat hot water
 
03:25:33.830 --> 03:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
and hopefully electricity in the future
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i always love to invite anybody to
 
03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
come up for a tour
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
um clients and services again i spoke
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
briefly about this you know we provide a
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
full continuum of any nursing home
 
03:25:49.110 --> 03:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
main focus is on nursing care adult
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
living care
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
we do provide recreational services
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
pre-covert that would include
 
03:25:56.550 --> 03:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
trips to the community shopping we rent
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
a house on a lake
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
once a year so residents can go swimming
 
03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
and do some barbecues
 
03:26:05.190 --> 03:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
we provide all the environmental
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
services such as housekeeping laundry
 
03:26:09.510 --> 03:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance dietary we're actually very
 
03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
well known for our food
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
most nursing homes have a difficulty
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
with residents losing weight when
 
03:26:16.150 --> 03:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
they're admitted we have a difficulty
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
with residents gaining weight
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we're
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
constantly working on with our dietitian
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
so we do also strive to use as many
 
03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:26.150 align:start position:0%
so we do also strive to use as many
non-medication

03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
non-medication
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
modalities and alternative approaches as
 
03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:29.190 align:start position:0%
modalities and alternative approaches as
possible

03:26:29.190 --> 03:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
we have staff trained in things such as
 
03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:32.309 align:start position:0%
we have staff trained in things such as
reiki

03:26:32.309 --> 03:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
reiki
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
just peer-to-peer support we do things
 
03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
just trying to redirect somebody and
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
again that takes me back to part of our
 
03:26:40.710 --> 03:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
mission where we accept people for who
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
they are
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
in other nursing homes they really
 
03:26:46.710 --> 03:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
um have a difficulty dealing with
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
somebody that has a
 
03:26:51.269 --> 03:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
behavior where they're verbally
 
03:26:53.190 --> 03:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
disruptive they're screaming or yelling
 
03:26:53.200 --> 03:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
disruptive they're screaming or yelling
out

03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
other nursing homes have to um market
 
03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
themselves and sell themselves and it's
 
03:26:58.630 --> 03:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
difficult when they're giving a tour and
 
03:26:58.640 --> 03:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
difficult when they're giving a tour and
someone's

03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
acting out we having the benefit of
 
03:27:01.920 --> 03:27:02.790 align:start position:0%
acting out we having the benefit of
being

03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:27:04.630 --> 03:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
run by the state do not have to market
 
03:27:04.640 --> 03:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
run by the state do not have to market
ourselves

03:27:05.830 --> 03:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
we actually always have a waitlist as
 
03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see in a future slide
 
03:27:11.190 --> 03:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
so we end up taking the people that no
 
03:27:13.030 --> 03:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
one else will
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
we actually knowing that we're a scarce
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
resource have required
 
03:27:20.469 --> 03:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
for the past 15 years that um for when
 
03:27:21.910 --> 03:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
someone applies to come here they have
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate in writing that at least
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
two other nursing home facilities has
 
03:27:26.710 --> 03:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
rejected them
 
03:27:28.950 --> 03:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
and turned them down and usually it's
 
03:27:30.790 --> 03:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
many more than that
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
again we strive to take people directly
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire hospital um
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
in your conversations with natural
 
03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
hospital you ask about
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
redirecting people from the e d
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
instead of going to national hospital we
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
occasionally are able to do that with an
 
03:27:44.319 --> 03:27:44.950 align:start position:0%
occasionally are able to do that with an
elder

03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
elder
 
03:27:47.349 --> 03:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
um at least a couple times a year it's
 
03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
not as freaking as we'd like but
 
03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we can do a direct emit
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
from one of those situations
 
03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
to help relieve that situation all right
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
on the next slide
 
03:28:01.349 --> 03:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
is a picture of our staff um
 
03:28:03.990 --> 03:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think it speaks to the dedication of
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
my staff um
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
similar to what heather was talking
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
about when they have a hospital i've
 
03:28:09.110 --> 03:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
been here
 
03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
20 years um hoping to be here for
 
03:28:13.349 --> 03:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
another 10 um before i can retire with
 
03:28:13.830 --> 03:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:28:16.469 --> 03:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
um a large number of my employees have
 
03:28:16.950 --> 03:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
been here
 
03:28:19.349 --> 03:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
um for quite a long time including the
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
direct care staff
 
03:28:22.389 --> 03:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
this last year or two has been
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
challenging a
 
03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
greater percentage of our folks now fall
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
into one to five years
 
03:28:29.910 --> 03:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
but i about 60 percent of our staff are
 
03:28:31.590 --> 03:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
still in the
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
five years plus range
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
all right the next slide there's a nice
 
03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:38.309 align:start position:0%
all right the next slide there's a nice
aerial

03:28:38.309 --> 03:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
aerial
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
shot um of the facility
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
so we maintain about 70 acres now back
 
03:28:46.389 --> 03:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
in the history we had over 500 acres and
 
03:28:48.309 --> 03:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
we did our own farming
 
03:28:49.830 --> 03:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
had cattle and pigs and those kind of
 
03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
things back in the tv days but now we
 
03:28:52.469 --> 03:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
just maintain
 
03:28:54.389 --> 03:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
a much smaller campus but that includes
 
03:28:56.229 --> 03:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
again the power plant
 
03:28:59.030 --> 03:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
a laundry facility some out housings
 
03:29:00.389 --> 03:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
that used to be like the head herdsmen's
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
house but that we now use to house
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
traveling nurses
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
maintenance shops and then the main
 
03:29:08.070 --> 03:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
large building that you can see there is
 
03:29:09.750 --> 03:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
the resident areas
 
03:29:10.950 --> 03:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
and then the other buildings are used
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
for administration and training and
 
03:29:15.990 --> 03:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:19.510 --> 03:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you moving on to our key
 
03:29:19.520 --> 03:29:21.190 align:start position:0%
thank you moving on to our key
performers

03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
performers
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
so our census um
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
the difference here that you'll notice
 
03:29:28.229 --> 03:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
between what we
 
03:29:31.750 --> 03:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
budget for in our actual ability billing
 
03:29:35.110 --> 03:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
monthly census is really largely due
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the past to billable days so as a
 
03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
normal nursing home
 
03:29:41.830 --> 03:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
we bill at midnight so if we have a
 
03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
resident that for some reason needs to
 
03:29:45.429 --> 03:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
go to cottage hospital or our local
 
03:29:45.439 --> 03:29:46.229 align:start position:0%
go to cottage hospital or our local
hospital

03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
for three days we can't bill for those
 
03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
three days
 
03:29:50.790 --> 03:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
so even though they're technically in a
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
bed and we have we cannot fill that bed
 
03:29:55.110 --> 03:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh we're required by cms to hold the bed
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
for a certain length of time
 
03:29:58.790 --> 03:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
we can't bill for it um so that drops
 
03:29:59.910 --> 03:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
our averages
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
um ideally we get up to 118
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
um filled beds so that our averages will
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
fall back closer to 116.
 
03:30:10.150 --> 03:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
um but i can tell you this last year has
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
been very challenging not only to
 
03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
the obvious scope of 19 challenges that
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
every nursing home has faced in the
 
03:30:16.080 --> 03:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
every nursing home has faced in the
state

03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
um but also with staffing issues
 
03:30:23.190 --> 03:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
any questions so far well i was just
 
03:30:23.910 --> 03:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
going to ask
 
03:30:27.750 --> 03:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
um looking at that aerial photo
 
03:30:31.190 --> 03:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
is there is there room to grow
 
03:30:33.429 --> 03:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
have you have you ever do you have any
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
on on the shelf
 
03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
plans to uh build more
 
03:30:39.910 --> 03:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
um actually that is a great question and
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
i am thrilled that you asked me
 
03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking at the picture uh
 
03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
inside the horseshoe of the large
 
03:30:45.760 --> 03:30:46.550 align:start position:0%
inside the horseshoe of the large
building

03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
we actually got um not last not this
 
03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
biennium but last biennium we got a
 
03:30:52.469 --> 03:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
capital project to fund
 
03:30:55.830 --> 03:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
the design and blueprints to be
 
03:30:59.269 --> 03:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
of a specific dementia unit we'd be
 
03:31:01.510 --> 03:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
right now we have four units we would be
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
building in that
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
ground we would actually sink it down
 
03:31:06.070 --> 03:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
into the ground and it would have a live
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
roof so all of those windows would look
 
03:31:09.190 --> 03:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
out over this new building
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
and we would add 26 beds specifically
 
03:31:15.269 --> 03:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
designed for dementia patients
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
because as i'll talk about shortly one
 
03:31:18.309 --> 03:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
of our challenges
 
03:31:20.790 --> 03:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
is that over the last particularly 10
 
03:31:20.800 --> 03:31:21.750 align:start position:0%
is that over the last particularly 10
years

03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:31:23.590 --> 03:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
more and more of our folks have
 
03:31:25.429 --> 03:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
developed dementia here
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
and more and more people on our wait
 
03:31:28.469 --> 03:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
list have dementia so now you're talking
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
about somebody that has
 
03:31:33.190 --> 03:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
a nursing home level medical issue
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
someone that has a mental illness or a
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
developmental disability and on top of
 
03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
that and are now developing
 
03:31:39.830 --> 03:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
dementia which is particularly
 
03:31:41.429 --> 03:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
challenging for us because
 
03:31:43.510 --> 03:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
the techniques and strategies that you
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
use with somebody
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
um that's suffering from a a mental
 
03:31:47.520 --> 03:31:48.309 align:start position:0%
um that's suffering from a a mental
illness

03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
illness
 
03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
and having those kind of behaviors um
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't always work with somebody with
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh that has developed dementia and what
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're seeing happen is someone who has
 
03:31:58.950 --> 03:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
developed skills to
 
03:32:01.510 --> 03:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
ignore the voices in their heads per se
 
03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
now they've got dementia and they've
 
03:32:03.990 --> 03:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
lost those skills
 
03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
um so their mental illness gets
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
exasperated by the dementia
 
03:32:09.910 --> 03:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
on top of the challenge of a dementia
 
03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
that anybody would have
 
03:32:14.469 --> 03:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
probably more than yeah do you have uh
 
03:32:17.110 --> 03:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
do you have an exterior fence to keep
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
dementia patients from wanting yes you
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
can't see it in this picture but
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
right on that tree line so that's a fire
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
break that goes around the whole campus
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
in just inside the tree line there is a
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
fence um
 
03:32:29.110 --> 03:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
all the way down to that road for the
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
very specific person that if we did have
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that was a flight risk or a
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
wander risk
 
03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
get out unsupervised it would funnel
 
03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
them down towards the maintenance shops
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
and the main roads so that
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
more staff would have a chance to find
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
them knock on wood
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm not trying to curse myself but
 
03:32:48.229 --> 03:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
my 20 years we've only had
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
one incidence where a resident was
 
03:32:51.510 --> 03:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
missing and um
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
we put in our plan which involves the
 
03:32:55.030 --> 03:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
state police and dogs um
 
03:32:56.550 --> 03:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
even before the dogs got here staff
 
03:32:58.150 --> 03:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
found them um he had climbed over the
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
fence um he was more physically able he
 
03:33:02.070 --> 03:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
climbed over the fence but we found him
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank god so that's the only instance of
 
03:33:04.880 --> 03:33:07.190 align:start position:0%
thank god so that's the only instance of
that

03:33:07.190 --> 03:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
all right so i think we were on slide
 
03:33:09.439 --> 03:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
all right so i think we were on slide
14.

03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:16.309 --> 03:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
this is our wait list um typically
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
we've been between 20 and 30 but you'll
 
03:33:19.520 --> 03:33:19.830 align:start position:0%
we've been between 20 and 30 but you'll
see

03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:33:23.429 --> 03:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
a huge increase starting when
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic started we found an increase on
 
03:33:28.389 --> 03:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
people that couldn't get into other
 
03:33:30.870 --> 03:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
facilities because of the challenges
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have difficulty discharging people to
 
03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
the community
 
03:33:35.990 --> 03:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
um because of other challenges those
 
03:33:36.950 --> 03:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
challenges and
 
03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
um our staffing has really been
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
suffering this last year so there has
 
03:33:41.990 --> 03:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
been periods of time where we have froze
 
03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
our census
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
um because we just don't have the staff
 
03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
to take care of a full complement of
 
03:33:47.680 --> 03:33:48.950 align:start position:0%
to take care of a full complement of
residents

03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
residents
 
03:33:51.910 --> 03:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
so right now we have 44 people 14 of
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
them are at new hampshire hospital
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
key accomplishments and i'm extremely
 
03:33:59.110 --> 03:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
extremely proud of my staff for this
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
first one
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have remained coveted free throughout
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
the whole pandemic
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
we have been extremely fortunate i think
 
03:34:07.590 --> 03:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
this is one of those cases where
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
being in a remote location has helped us
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
where it hurts us with recruitment it
 
03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
certainly helps with pandemic
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
well my staff deserves a huge credit
 
03:34:17.429 --> 03:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
they've done an excellent job
 
03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
of doing all the things that cms
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
requires above and beyond
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
screening taking care of things like
 
03:34:25.110 --> 03:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
that and at this point we have 93
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
of our residents have been fully
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and the seven percent uh is
 
03:34:30.550 --> 03:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
because they chose not to
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
um that was an individual's choice um to
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated or not
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
um so we're very proud of that one uh
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
second accomplishment we implemented um
 
03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 really
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
doing an l a class because we are
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
really hurting for staffing so we've
 
03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
realized that we need to grow our own
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
so we have in the last year and a half
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
or so graduated 28 lnas and three m
 
03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
a's and m a is a medication nursing
 
03:35:02.790 --> 03:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
assistant so it's an illness that has an
 
03:35:04.229 --> 03:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
additional certification
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
so they can pass medications they can't
 
03:35:06.720 --> 03:35:07.269 align:start position:0%
so they can pass medications they can't
assess

03:35:07.269 --> 03:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
assess
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
or diagnose but they can pass
 
03:35:11.030 --> 03:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
medications and then if they see a
 
03:35:12.550 --> 03:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
resident that might be having an issue
 
03:35:15.190 --> 03:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
they can go and get a nurse so that that
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
has helped
 
03:35:19.590 --> 03:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
with our staffing somewhat and then as i
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
since 2017 we have discharged 26
 
03:35:25.750 --> 03:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
residents back out in the community
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
again this helps us admit patients from
 
03:35:29.429 --> 03:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital and other
 
03:35:32.070 --> 03:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
other facilities really you know part of
 
03:35:34.630 --> 03:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
the back door solution
 
03:35:36.790 --> 03:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
key accomplishments uh we are an old
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
campus a lot of old buildings you
 
03:35:40.550 --> 03:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier today you know a
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
building that must have looked great in
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
1880s well
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
some of our buildings looked great in
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
1806 in 1809
 
03:35:49.349 --> 03:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
and now they need a lot of work um we
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
have gotten some capital projects in the
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
last few bienniums
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
the last one being improving our pothole
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
water system
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
historically the facility has used a
 
03:36:00.630 --> 03:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
basically a dug well
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
up on the side of the mountain
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
established in
 
03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
1940 it's a 30 foot round 30 foot deep
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
dug well
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
it provided all the water up until the
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
last couple years where we have had to
 
03:36:13.830 --> 03:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
add some additional artesian wells
 
03:36:15.750 --> 03:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we're looking actually to remove the
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
dug well offline with a couple
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
more wells as recommended by des
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
and then things like improving the fire
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
access road and roof and boilers and
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
generators and all those kind of fun
 
03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
generators and all those kind of fun
things

03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
key challenges front door for us
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh obviously a wait list of 44 is not
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
acceptable that means
 
03:36:39.670 --> 03:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
a large number of people are waiting to
 
03:36:41.590 --> 03:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
get into the facility
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
for us they are mostly not not in eds
 
03:36:46.950 --> 03:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
occasionally they are most of them are
 
03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
either still at home
 
03:36:51.990 --> 03:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
at a hospital but admitted but they're
 
03:36:53.910 --> 03:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
looking to play some or at new hampshire
 
03:36:53.920 --> 03:36:55.030 align:start position:0%
looking to play some or at new hampshire
hospital

03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
and that is the our biggest customer is
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
so and then as i mentioned before the
 
03:37:03.030 --> 03:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
significant increase in referrals with
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
patients with dementia
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
um so dementia itself is not a diagnosis
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
that will allow somebody to come here
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
but like i said they often are paired
 
03:37:12.070 --> 03:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
with someone that has medical issues on
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
top of a mental illness and now have
 
03:37:16.389 --> 03:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
dementia on top of that
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
our backdoor issue is uh as you've heard
 
03:37:20.550 --> 03:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of times today
 
03:37:22.150 --> 03:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
housing in the community and support
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
systems in the community
 
03:37:25.990 --> 03:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
because our folks not only have to have
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
the supports around their mental illness
 
03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
they also need to have the supports
 
03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
they also need to have the supports
around

03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
their medical needs diabetes being a
 
03:37:33.750 --> 03:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
great example
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
someone might mentally and cognitively
 
03:37:36.880 --> 03:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
someone might mentally and cognitively
be

03:37:37.990 --> 03:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
very capable of living in a group home
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
but most group homes do not have a nurse
 
03:37:44.469 --> 03:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
available to do injections
 
03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
and to do insulin and these individuals
 
03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
are not able to do them themselves
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
very much related to that is the support
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
support staff in the community
 
03:37:55.830 --> 03:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
operational our real big one is
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention
 
03:37:59.190 --> 03:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know the hospital spoke about a
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
number of um initiatives that they've
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
taken we've taken some similar ones
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
but we are uh really struggling
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
particularly because of our location
 
03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
um you know those 28 people that we've
 
03:38:11.349 --> 03:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
put through our
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
lna program we've off like we just
 
03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
offered a program to start in february
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
and we had nobody
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
apply we've kind of tapped all of the
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
resources around us so we're starting to
 
03:38:25.269 --> 03:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
expand that circle we're advertising
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
further out
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
and basically it's grow your own so if
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
someone agrees to take the class
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
and be an lna with us for a year it's
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
free for them
 
03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
so initially we had a number of
 
03:38:37.590 --> 03:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
employees that came from other
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
departments such as
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
dietary and housekeeping in laundry that
 
03:38:43.030 --> 03:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
took the class
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
and became lnas and then we had a number
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
of people from the community
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not all of them have
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
stayed with us
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
after their initial commitment and then
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
we have the typical um
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
challenges of operationing a a 100 plus
 
03:38:58.150 --> 03:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
year old campus
 
03:39:00.309 --> 03:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
furniture equipment buildings those type
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
lots of benchmarks and staffing
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to get at five percent i'm
 
03:39:09.520 --> 03:39:11.189 align:start position:0%
if we were to get at five percent i'm
sorry

03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah would you would you give me a call
 
03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
after this i i have a crazy
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
an idea too crazy to say in public
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay i want to share i want to share an
 
03:39:22.870 --> 03:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
idea with you okay i will certainly get
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
like today
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
that'd be great okay i will do that
 
03:39:31.110 --> 03:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
so if we were to get an increase we
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
would put that towards
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
additional professional recruitment of
 
03:39:34.160 --> 03:39:35.750 align:start position:0%
additional professional recruitment of
staff

03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:39:37.910 --> 03:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
we have been using some travel nurses we
 
03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
have talked with new hampshire hospital
 
03:39:41.429 --> 03:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
about increasing some of those
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
contracts and how much we pay for nurses
 
03:39:45.670 --> 03:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
but also
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
number of contracts the covid
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
has really hurt us there pre-covered we
 
03:39:52.630 --> 03:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
were using
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
three to five travel nurses at a time
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have two right now um and we're
 
03:39:59.429 --> 03:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
lucky to have them
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
um a lot of places like florida we're
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
offering huge sign-on bonuses and things
 
03:40:04.710 --> 03:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
like that for travel nurses
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
that we were just obviously not able to
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
compete with
 
03:40:09.750 --> 03:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
then we would put more money into
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
improving resident living areas
 
03:40:12.870 --> 03:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
and then facility maintenance and
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
equipment upgrade if we were to get a
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
additional cuts obviously we would have
 
03:40:21.790 --> 03:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
to take that out of staffing about
 
03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
83 percent of our budget is personnel
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
um joe can correct me if i'm wrong on
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
that number
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
um so unfortunately we would have to
 
03:40:30.800 --> 03:40:31.510 align:start position:0%
um so unfortunately we would have to
eliminate

03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
vacancies first for savings
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
but a lot of that vacancy money we are
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
now using to pay the agency nurses
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
and to pay for overtime so we're
 
03:40:42.239 --> 03:40:43.750 align:start position:0%
and to pay for overtime so we're
maintaining

03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
safe staffing levels but that is heavy
 
03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
use of overtime
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
and travel nurses and then we would you
 
03:40:50.160 --> 03:40:50.469 align:start position:0%
and travel nurses and then we would you
know

03:40:50.469 --> 03:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
do the typical defer equipment and
 
03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:53.750 align:start position:0%
do the typical defer equipment and
maintenance

03:40:53.750 --> 03:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
so this next slide speaks to our
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
staffing challenges
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know obviously the first
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
line is our nurses
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
drs is just another term for director of
 
03:41:10.560 --> 03:41:12.150 align:start position:0%
drs is just another term for director of
nursing

03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
so we have 31 nurses in total that
 
03:41:15.120 --> 03:41:15.750 align:start position:0%
so we have 31 nurses in total that
includes

03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
includes
 
03:41:18.070 --> 03:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
five nursing managers um but please
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't think of them as administration
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
they work the floors um even our
 
03:41:22.950 --> 03:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
director of nursing we're at the point
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
where she's working
 
03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
um you know eight 12 hours 16 hours out
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
of her 40 hours a week
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
direct care giving medications and
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
providing care to the residents
 
03:41:36.389 --> 03:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
because we are so low low staff that
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
number is actually a little deceiving
 
03:41:42.309 --> 03:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
38 vacancy rate for nurses it's a little
 
03:41:44.150 --> 03:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
higher because we have an individual out
 
03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
on fnla
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
but when you break it out by shift our
 
03:41:48.640 --> 03:41:49.349 align:start position:0%
but when you break it out by shift our
second

03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
shift nursing is at 62 percent vacancy
 
03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:52.389 align:start position:0%
shift nursing is at 62 percent vacancy
rate

03:41:52.389 --> 03:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know that requires us to have
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
nurses from day shift or third shift
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
move on
 
03:42:02.309 --> 03:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
do overtime cover shifts we are
 
03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
the last year and a half first time ever
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
mandating nurses we never had to in my
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
20 plus years until this last year and a
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
half so um so we are really struggling
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
with nurses
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
same can be said with lnas not quite as
 
03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
severe you know the overall vacancy rate
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
is about 20 to 23
 
03:42:21.429 --> 03:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
but if you look at um third shift um
 
03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
lnas we're at like 40
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
vacancy and second shift is about 35
 
03:42:25.760 --> 03:42:26.469 align:start position:0%
vacancy and second shift is about 35
percent

03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh we obviously do better on day shifts
 
03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
because people like to work during the
 
03:42:29.439 --> 03:42:30.309 align:start position:0%
because people like to work during the
day

03:42:30.309 --> 03:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
instead of nights and uh and on the
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
weekends so
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
other than that um we do usually pretty
 
03:42:37.030 --> 03:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
well with recruiting
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we have some vacancies some
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the other departments which is a new
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
thing for us and i think it is somewhat
 
03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:42.630 align:start position:0%
thing for us and i think it is somewhat
co-related

03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
co-related
 
03:42:44.229 --> 03:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
we never even used to have to advertise
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
for positions other than nurses and l
 
03:42:47.429 --> 03:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
a's and this year we're finding that we
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
do have to advertise and put some more
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
effort into finding people that are
 
03:42:51.990 --> 03:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
03:42:55.510 --> 03:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
state jobs questions if you have an
 
03:42:55.520 --> 03:42:56.550 align:start position:0%
state jobs questions if you have an
on-call

03:42:56.550 --> 03:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
on-call
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
sleeping facility there so that if
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
somebody is working overtime they could
 
03:43:04.950 --> 03:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
go crash for a few hours so we do have
 
03:43:04.960 --> 03:43:05.429 align:start position:0%
go crash for a few hours so we do have
um

03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of houses on campus
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned earlier uh we use one
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
for travel nurses so the other one is
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
available for nurses like
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh a couple weeks ago when we had one of
 
03:43:16.150 --> 03:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
those bad storms we had a nurse that was
 
03:43:17.590 --> 03:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
working second shift
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
he asked if he could sleep over because
 
03:43:21.510 --> 03:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
then he was gonna work first shift and
 
03:43:22.950 --> 03:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
second shift he's gonna do a double the
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
next day
 
03:43:26.229 --> 03:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
so we do things like that routinely um
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
and then we also use them for the travel
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
nurses so there is some of that
 
03:43:34.229 --> 03:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
and then um due to our nursing shortages
 
03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
the director of nursing and the nurse
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
on-call duties for the weekends so that
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
if a nurse calls out sick
 
03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
one of those nurses gets called in
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're really burning out our staff so
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
03:43:52.950 --> 03:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me that's why we have frozen
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
admissions um
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
and off and on representative walter has
 
03:44:00.630 --> 03:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you did um
 
03:44:06.870 --> 03:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
the staff at the uh at glencliff
 
03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
also get the 20 pay enhancement that was
 
03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
um provided for new hampshire hospital
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
oh no they did not uh
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital went forward they
 
03:44:21.030 --> 03:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
were also at a critical staffing
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
for 20 for mental health workers my
 
03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:24.469 align:start position:0%
for 20 for mental health workers my
staff

03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
are lnas so they were not included in
 
03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:27.590 align:start position:0%
are lnas so they were not included in
that

03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is something we are looking at
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
potentially asking government councils
 
03:44:31.120 --> 03:44:31.590 align:start position:0%
potentially asking government councils
for

03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
but we haven't at this point so it's not
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.150 --> 03:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
hello no thank you
 
03:44:44.150 --> 03:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh i see all those
 
03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
buildings on that campus
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
does any of the staff live on campus
 
03:44:55.990 --> 03:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
just the travel nurses they're the only
 
03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:56.389 align:start position:0%
just the travel nurses they're the only
ones

03:44:56.389 --> 03:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
ones
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
it seems like you what what kind of
 
03:45:00.309 --> 03:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
commute do most of them have you're
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
fairly remote
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
how's the longest road you've got to get
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
to your facility
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
well my deputy administrator lives in
 
03:45:07.600 --> 03:45:08.389 align:start position:0%
well my deputy administrator lives in
concord

03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
concord
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
um so she travels an hour and 15 good
 
03:45:11.279 --> 03:45:12.550 align:start position:0%
um so she travels an hour and 15 good
weather

03:45:12.550 --> 03:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
weather
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
i'd say the average employee is probably
 
03:45:16.150 --> 03:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
30 minutes um
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
you know we have someone live right here
 
03:45:19.349 --> 03:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
in warren so they're 15 20 minutes
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
um but then we have people that come all
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
the way down from littleton
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
lisbon we have a number of staff that
 
03:45:26.309 --> 03:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
live in vermont so i'd say on
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
average 30 to 40 minutes um
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
so i was wondering if you had a
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
dormitory if you would help in
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
recruiting and you could charge a little
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
bit for the
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
for living there and be a good deal for
 
03:45:40.630 --> 03:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
some people that they work right on
 
03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:41.910 align:start position:0%
some people that they work right on
campus

03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
campus
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
you're starting to get into my crazy
 
03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
idea there representative weiler ah
 
03:45:45.680 --> 03:45:46.710 align:start position:0%
idea there representative weiler ah
sorry

sorry
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
well no why not partner with a community
 
03:45:49.120 --> 03:45:50.550 align:start position:0%
well no why not partner with a community

to take care of your own during training
 
03:46:09.110 --> 03:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
and still have others available
 
03:46:12.309 --> 03:46:12.319 align:start position:0%

college campus
 
03:46:17.429 --> 03:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
all we need is money actually
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
all we need is trained personnel to be
 
03:46:20.950 --> 03:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
teachers um
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
we it's not an off the wall idea we have
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
been working with the vermont technical
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
college because they're they're close to
 
03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
us over the border
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
for the last two years trying to
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
establish a
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
lpn program a licensed practical nurse
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
program here on campus we have a
 
03:46:36.960 --> 03:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
program here on campus we have a
building

03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
we bought most of the equipment we would
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
need we've done
 
03:46:42.630 --> 03:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
most of the paperwork with the new
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire board of nursing where we have
 
03:46:44.880 --> 03:46:45.510 align:start position:0%
hampshire board of nursing where we have
failed

03:46:45.510 --> 03:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
failed
 
03:46:48.389 --> 03:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
is for the college or ourselves to
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
recruit a nurse with enough credentials
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
to teach it
 
03:46:55.269 --> 03:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
most nurses that have their masters are
 
03:46:55.279 --> 03:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
most nurses that have their masters are
higher

03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
are working already in the teaching
 
03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
field or they're working at hospitals
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
and things like that as teachers
 
03:47:06.070 --> 03:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
significant salaries so we have not been
 
03:47:06.080 --> 03:47:06.389 align:start position:0%
significant salaries so we have not been
able

03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
able
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
we we had one we thought we were on the
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
verge of opening
 
03:47:11.910 --> 03:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
our first class since last august but
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
she declined the position
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
at last minute the deal with vermont
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
technical college was
 
03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
they provide all of the credentialing
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
they provide some of the supports
 
03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
we provide the instructor and we get
 
03:47:24.399 --> 03:47:24.870 align:start position:0%
we provide the instructor and we get
four

03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
free slots so we can put four of our
 
03:47:28.150 --> 03:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
employees into their
 
03:47:31.269 --> 03:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
program for free by providing the
 
03:47:32.550 --> 03:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
instructor and we've not been able to
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
recruit somebody
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not an off the wall idea we do
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
partner with um
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
plymouth state university they use us as
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
a clinical for
 
03:47:45.510 --> 03:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
their nursing program so we have
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
students coming through regularly
 
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't
 
03:47:51.189 --> 03:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
ever really get any of those nurses
 
03:47:52.229 --> 03:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
because they're young
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
and they want to work in hospitals and
 
03:47:55.349 --> 03:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
they want to work in mid-surge they want
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
to work in er
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
they don't typically want to do nursing
 
03:47:59.670 --> 03:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
home level care
 
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
some of them have shown some interest
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
this year so i'm hoping maybe we'll get
 
03:48:03.670 --> 03:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
one or two because they're more
 
03:48:05.429 --> 03:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
interested in the site part of it
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
um so we pre exhaustively try
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
um including every time i go get blood i
 
03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
hand out my business card
 
03:48:18.389 --> 03:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
um any nurses is more than welcome
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren you have a
 
03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:21.510 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren you have a
question

03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:48:25.030 --> 03:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
um i'm worried looking at this slide
 
03:48:30.870 --> 03:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
that you're really lacking custodial
 
03:48:30.880 --> 03:48:31.910 align:start position:0%
that you're really lacking custodial
care

03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:48:34.229 --> 03:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
um with the pandemic and all the
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
concerns we have now this
 
03:48:39.910 --> 03:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
must be really hard for you to keep up
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
all right it certainly has been
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
challenging um and we have a couple of
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
vacancies so it's not a large department
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
beginning with there's only nine
 
03:48:47.189 --> 03:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
positions so
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
um right now we have two vacant um but
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
we do have somebody in the pipeline
 
03:48:52.950 --> 03:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
i believe they're starting in two weeks
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
so that number will go down
 
03:48:57.429 --> 03:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
but really all of the staff have stepped
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
up um
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
so l a's in particular also do cleaning
 
03:49:03.269 --> 03:49:03.279 align:start position:0%
especially like the typical wiping down
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
door handles and
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
hand rails and those type of things but
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
even maintenance has stepped up and
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
done some additional housekeeping work
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
um in some of the technologies that
 
03:49:16.150 --> 03:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
joe mentioned earlier we bought one of
 
03:49:18.229 --> 03:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
the ultraviolet robots that can clean a
 
03:49:18.239 --> 03:49:18.790 align:start position:0%
the ultraviolet robots that can clean a
room

03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
room
 
03:49:20.550 --> 03:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
so we've been learning how to do it more
 
03:49:20.560 --> 03:49:22.630 align:start position:0%
so we've been learning how to do it more
efficiently

03:49:22.630 --> 03:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
in more uh more specifically to the
 
03:49:28.150 --> 03:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic concerns uh so they've been
 
03:49:29.110 --> 03:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
doing a nice job
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
um but it really is a team effort up
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
here so
 
03:49:34.150 --> 03:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh right now we're hurting a little bit
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
and particularly on second shift of
 
03:49:37.269 --> 03:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
housekeeping but i think we've got
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
comments or questions on this slide so
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
continuing with uh benchmarking
 
03:49:49.510 --> 03:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
so this is a slide that gives you a it's
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
a point in time
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is the national average the state
 
03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
average and then our average for
 
03:49:55.120 --> 03:49:55.830 align:start position:0%
average and then our average for
staffing

03:49:55.830 --> 03:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
and they break it down it's just looking
 
03:49:59.429 --> 03:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
at nursing
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
and specifically rn and then lna
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
this information is gathered by cms's
 
03:50:06.389 --> 03:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
survey so
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
as any other nursing home in the state
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
we are
 
03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
under cms regulations so once a year we
 
03:50:14.150 --> 03:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
have a survey team from the bureau of
 
03:50:15.429 --> 03:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
health and facilities
 
03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
which is also part of dhhs come and do a
 
03:50:19.590 --> 03:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
full survey
 
03:50:22.389 --> 03:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
they take a two week picture of our
 
03:50:22.399 --> 03:50:22.950 align:start position:0%
they take a two week picture of our
staffing

03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
03:50:24.389 --> 03:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
and use it to compare it to everybody
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
else so while this
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
looks like we're doing well we're
 
03:50:28.720 --> 03:50:29.910 align:start position:0%
looks like we're doing well we're
average

03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
average
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually a little low for us
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
because typically because of our
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
population we want to staff a little
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
um higher than most nursing homes um and
 
03:50:39.990 --> 03:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
this was a point in time about a year
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
ago i think right now so if you add the
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
43 minutes the 2 hours and
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
35 minutes you get about an hour
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh 3.2 we've been averaging about
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
2.8 or 3.0 um
 
03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
the last couple of months um but we're
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
hope we're working hard
 
03:51:00.870 --> 03:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
to bump that back up we maintain it
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
again using overtime
 
03:51:04.150 --> 03:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
travel nurses and then mandating staff
 
03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
when we have to but
 
03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
as you can expect nobody likes to be
 
03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:08.710 align:start position:0%
as you can expect nobody likes to be
mandated

03:51:08.710 --> 03:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
so we try not to do that as much as
 
03:51:10.080 --> 03:51:12.389 align:start position:0%
so we try not to do that as much as
possible

03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:51:22.150 --> 03:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:23.910 --> 03:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
oh i guess this is the part where i turn
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
it back over to joe
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
um sure thank you everyone
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so from a financial
 
03:51:33.199 --> 03:51:33.990 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so from a financial
perspective

03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh glencliff is is pretty evenly split
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
between general funds and other funds
 
03:51:40.469 --> 03:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
their other fund source is really
 
03:51:41.910 --> 03:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
medicaid revenue
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so uh uh a
 
03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
virtually an overwhelming majority
 
03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
if not all of the patients at glencliff
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
um qualify for medicaid
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
um and they receive a daily rate
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh as a nursing home uh so
 
03:52:00.790 --> 03:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
this is really their their source of
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
funds um they don't have
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh much of an opportunity to bill uh
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
other insurances they they do bill
 
03:52:09.910 --> 03:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh patients or estates directly um
 
03:52:12.870 --> 03:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
if if uh the opportunity arises but it's
 
03:52:14.070 --> 03:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
not very common
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
most of these individuals are are really
 
03:52:16.880 --> 03:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
most of these individuals are are really
a

03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
primary uh medicaid patient population
 
03:52:23.110 --> 03:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
if i can inject we currently have two
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:30.550 --> 03:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
um so so their general funds are pretty
 
03:52:30.560 --> 03:52:31.510 align:start position:0%
um so so their general funds are pretty
uh

03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:34.389 --> 03:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
consistent year over year um and then
 
03:52:34.399 --> 03:52:34.710 align:start position:0%
consistent year over year um and then
the

03:52:34.710 --> 03:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
the total funds of their budget um
 
03:52:41.429 --> 03:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
you'll see from the 2020 2021 bienniums
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
to the 2022 biennium not a significant
 
03:52:49.349 --> 03:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
increase in uh in total funds
 
03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
and uh there were a few prioritized
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
needs that were created for a glencliff
 
03:52:58.150 --> 03:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's it was mostly relative to
 
03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
wages due to vacancies so um
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
we do have a list of prioritized needs
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i can provide that if if the
 
03:53:05.040 --> 03:53:05.670 align:start position:0%
and i can provide that if if the
community

03:53:05.670 --> 03:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:53:08.070 --> 03:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
if the committee is interested in seeing
 
03:53:11.220 --> 03:53:11.230 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.230 --> 03:53:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
and did you want me to go on to the um
 
03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
the budget book now or let's see that
 
03:53:22.080 --> 03:53:23.429 align:start position:0%
the budget book now or let's see that
yes

03:53:23.429 --> 03:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:53:26.469 --> 03:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
okay okay shut off
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure not seeing any questions so so
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
let's keep rolling
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:41.349 --> 03:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
so glencliff in the budget book starts
 
03:53:44.070 --> 03:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
at page 1099
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
it is activity code 9100 and their first
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is
 
03:53:48.880 --> 03:53:55.189 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is
5710.

03:53:55.189 --> 03:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:57.110 --> 03:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
this first accounting unit is for
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
professional care this is
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
primarily all of their direct care staff
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
and the costs associated with providing
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:09.189 align:start position:0%

03:54:09.189 --> 03:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
again we had some prioritized needs that
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
we created for
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
predominantly payroll lines so you'll
 
03:54:18.070 --> 03:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
see class 18 in this
 
03:54:21.500 --> 03:54:21.510 align:start position:0%
is is pretty flat
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:26.070 align:start position:0%
is is pretty flat

03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:54:32.309 --> 03:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner thank you
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
um did you is is this pretty much what
 
03:54:41.429 --> 03:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
you requested
 
03:54:44.309 --> 03:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
of the governor and are the prioritized
 
03:54:44.319 --> 03:54:45.030 align:start position:0%
of the governor and are the prioritized
needs

03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
needs
 
03:54:48.309 --> 03:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
that you had um that you gave to the
 
03:54:51.189 --> 03:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
governor that were not funded
 
03:54:54.070 --> 03:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
um so great question the prioritized
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
needs were not funded in the
 
03:54:59.590 --> 03:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
governor's phase i can
 
03:55:01.590 --> 03:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
i i heard this question come up on a few
 
03:55:03.750 --> 03:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
prior presentations that i tuned in on
 
03:55:03.760 --> 03:55:04.070 align:start position:0%
prior presentations that i tuned in on
uh

03:55:04.070 --> 03:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
and so i can certainly provide uh what
 
03:55:07.750 --> 03:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
those were
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
they are included on the total
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs spreadsheet
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
um that i provided to kevin last week
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
so you should have those on that
 
03:55:15.840 --> 03:55:17.910 align:start position:0%
so you should have those on that
spreadsheet

03:55:17.910 --> 03:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay um i just went further why
 
03:55:23.110 --> 03:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
i unfortunately haven't looked at that
 
03:55:24.630 --> 03:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
um yet
 
03:55:27.750 --> 03:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
and um could you just quickly
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
maybe highlight the top you know the the
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
most important prioritized needs that
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
you had on your list
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
sure um todd please jump in at any point
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
but i
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
i think um really any of the payroll
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
lines relative to this accounting unit
 
03:55:46.150 --> 03:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
5710 direct care
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
um i would i would say are the most
 
03:55:48.960 --> 03:55:49.590 align:start position:0%
um i would i would say are the most
important

03:55:49.590 --> 03:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:55:51.370 --> 03:55:51.380 align:start position:0%
and would you agree with that todd
 
03:55:51.380 --> 03:55:54.830 align:start position:0%
and would you agree with that todd

03:55:57.510 --> 03:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh so those were um class 18 uh class
 
03:56:04.389 --> 03:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
50 part-time staff um
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to remember the others
 
03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
that were in this accounting unit
 
03:56:11.670 --> 03:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
i saw that some of it because it's um
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
payroll spills into um bumping up the
 
03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:15.590 align:start position:0%
payroll spills into um bumping up the
benefits

03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:56:18.630 --> 03:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
um and it's about 500 000
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
total and 400 of that is personnel
 
03:56:21.199 --> 03:56:21.910 align:start position:0%
total and 400 of that is personnel
related

03:56:21.910 --> 03:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
related
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
the other 100 000 is a few things like
 
03:56:24.399 --> 03:56:25.030 align:start position:0%
the other 100 000 is a few things like
equipment

03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think representative has more
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions no thank you
 
03:56:36.830 --> 03:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's helpful representative
 
03:56:36.840 --> 03:56:41.110 align:start position:0%
that's helpful representative
weiler

03:56:41.110 --> 03:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um consultants
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:50.840 --> 03:56:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
consultants

03:56:53.269 --> 03:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
consultants
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh would you like me to answer that joe
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure uh so on that line
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
46 um we have a dentist that comes well
 
03:57:04.150 --> 03:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
came pre-covered um twice a month now he
 
03:57:06.309 --> 03:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
comes only on urgent care
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
we also pay a high hygienist out of that
 
03:57:10.870 --> 03:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
because we do have a full
 
03:57:13.830 --> 03:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
dental suite here at the facility we
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
have a registered dietitian
 
03:57:18.229 --> 03:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
that i believe is paid out of that line
 
03:57:20.710 --> 03:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
podiatrist rn that comes and provides
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
those services
 
03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then i think we might also have a
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
massage therapist in there
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you you have a pastor do you have
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
pastoral services
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh we do we have a
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
again pre-coveted we have a roman
 
03:57:42.150 --> 03:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
catholic priest that comes and does
 
03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
mass on sundays and then we have a
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
protestant minister that also comes and
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of different bible groups that
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
come regularly again pre-coping
 
03:57:54.150 --> 03:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
right now nobody comes in did any of
 
03:57:54.160 --> 03:57:54.710 align:start position:0%
right now nobody comes in did any of
those

03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh come under this consulting line or
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
were they volunteer
 
03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
because that doesn't seem like a lot of
 
03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
money for all that extra
 
03:58:05.349 --> 03:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
ancillary care you're getting well most
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
of that ancillary care
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
is pretty infrequent like i said the
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
dentist only comes twice a month
 
03:58:13.590 --> 03:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
um and i might be off a little bit like
 
03:58:13.600 --> 03:58:14.070 align:start position:0%
um and i might be off a little bit like
the

03:58:14.070 --> 03:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
dietitian who has a bigger contract she
 
03:58:17.590 --> 03:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
might be out of um
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
101 medical payments
 
03:58:22.309 --> 03:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
but medical payments is also where we've
 
03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
been using to you'll see that number's
 
03:58:25.110 --> 03:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
awfully large
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
we've been using that for the travel
 
03:58:26.319 --> 03:58:29.670 align:start position:0%
we've been using that for the travel
nurses

03:58:29.670 --> 03:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up representative or
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
was that
 
03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh just moving along
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
so uh 5720 custodial care
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm a little slow i want to go back for
 
03:58:49.110 --> 03:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
a second
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
so so you knew how much ancillary care
 
03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
you wanted and it was all working and
 
03:58:57.030 --> 03:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
then the pandemic hit and they've
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
essentially stopped coming so so what is
 
03:59:01.990 --> 03:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
the clinical outcome
 
03:59:04.469 --> 03:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
what what what is the suffering as a
 
03:59:04.479 --> 03:59:05.349 align:start position:0%
what what what is the suffering as a
result

03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
result
 
03:59:08.550 --> 03:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the diminished care is it
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
measurable in any way or is it just
 
03:59:11.359 --> 03:59:12.630 align:start position:0%
measurable in any way or is it just
subjective

03:59:12.630 --> 03:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
03:59:14.309 --> 03:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh mostly subjective but it is
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
measurable in that um
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
we've had times where we've had to
 
03:59:19.349 --> 03:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
freeze our admissions um
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
so that hurts the wait list that hurts
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital that hurts our
 
03:59:22.800 --> 03:59:24.070 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital that hurts our
revenue

03:59:24.070 --> 03:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
so that's one um very uh
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
measurable outcome um as far as direct
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
care for our residents um
 
03:59:35.110 --> 03:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh they have not been to our
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge they have not been suffering
 
03:59:36.399 --> 03:59:37.269 align:start position:0%
knowledge they have not been suffering
medically

03:59:37.269 --> 03:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
medically
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
um because we continue to use over time
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
and mandating to ensure that they're
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
getting the care they need
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
now socially and mentally they're
 
03:59:48.469 --> 03:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
certainly suffering this year
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic so you know our
 
03:59:52.870 --> 03:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
residents we have four units they've
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
been um confined to their own right
 
03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
their own unit you know they have
 
03:59:58.150 --> 03:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
friends in other units they can't go
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
outside unsupervised so
 
04:00:01.189 --> 04:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of that's happened and they can't
 
04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
go on shopping trips and outlook
 
04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
to dinner and things like that that we
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
used to do um pre-covet so that has
 
04:00:08.309 --> 04:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
certainly affected it
 
04:00:10.150 --> 04:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
but the low staffing also affects that
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
because when we're at minimum staffing
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have the extra staff for those
 
04:00:14.710 --> 04:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
type of activities
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we suffer the the
 
04:00:19.830 --> 04:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
recreational the social
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know the cognitive stimulation
 
04:00:21.680 --> 04:00:23.349 align:start position:0%
you know the cognitive stimulation
suffers

04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
suffers
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
so the the next accounting unit was 5720
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh which is custodial care
 
04:00:41.990 --> 04:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is where the supportive departments
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
for things like housekeeping
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
um facilities uh et cetera
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's primarily what constitutes this
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
the cost of that staff
 
04:00:54.410 --> 04:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition
 
04:00:54.420 --> 04:00:56.950 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition
[Music]

04:00:56.950 --> 04:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:00:58.870 --> 04:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
again there were some prioritized needs
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
relative to payroll lines
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
in this accounting unit as well but uh
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
again if we were to prioritize them we
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
would prioritize the
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs in the 5710 accounting
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
unit over the 5720
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so is that contracted
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
food services
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
if so is that done on site or off-site
 
04:01:20.150 --> 04:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
and brought in
 
04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh is not contracted they are state
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
employees and we do it all on site
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
um we have our own dietary department
 
04:01:30.630 --> 04:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
we looked at it i wanna say five years
 
04:01:30.640 --> 04:01:31.110 align:start position:0%
we looked at it i wanna say five years
ago

04:01:31.110 --> 04:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
maybe six years ago um and actually
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of contracting it um
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
was within ten thousand dollars of what
 
04:01:41.590 --> 04:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
we pay for it here
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
um back then i'm sure it's changed in
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
five six years
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
so at that time the decision was made to
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
continue to leave them as state
 
04:01:48.080 --> 04:01:55.189 align:start position:0%
continue to leave them as state
employees

04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
any questions on this accounting unit
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next one is accounting unit
 
04:02:04.319 --> 04:02:05.349 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next one is accounting unit
5740

04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
5740
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is the uh administrative accounting
 
04:02:07.920 --> 04:02:09.830 align:start position:0%
this is the uh administrative accounting
unit

04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
unit
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
again they run a very lean
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
administrative shop at glencliff very
 
04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.469 --> 04:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
and this really comprises of their their
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
core leadership structure
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
is that telecommunications for the whole
 
04:02:35.439 --> 04:02:36.229 align:start position:0%
is that telecommunications for the whole
operation

04:02:36.229 --> 04:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
operation
 
04:02:37.990 --> 04:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
or is there telecommunications
 
04:02:38.000 --> 04:02:39.910 align:start position:0%
or is there telecommunications
throughout

04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
um i i believe that is for the whole
 
04:02:44.790 --> 04:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
facility because
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
we pay for a phone that is
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
that is correct it is for the whole
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
facility um so
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
um our internet and um computer and
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
stuff comes through the department
 
04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
you have clients or patients that
 
04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
want to use um the wi-fi for their own
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
internet access
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes and that's something we actually are
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
continuing to work with
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
doit on when the pandemic hit we had
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
no wi-fi in the facility we didn't even
 
04:03:16.150 --> 04:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
have it for our nurses
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's something we've been struggling
 
04:03:19.750 --> 04:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
with to get
 
04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
up here on the hill with the oit's
 
04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:22.950 align:start position:0%
up here on the hill with the oit's
approval

04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
approval
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
when pandemic hit they were able to
 
04:03:25.199 --> 04:03:26.229 align:start position:0%
when pandemic hit they were able to
install

04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
install
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
nine laptops with zoom on it so that
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
residents could contact their families
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
and do some telehealth but it is
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
extremely limited it can only do zoom
 
04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
literally the computers are locked down
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
that they can only do zoom and we can't
 
04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
initiate them we can only accept them
 
04:03:42.870 --> 04:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm still working with doit to
 
04:03:42.880 --> 04:03:44.309 align:start position:0%
so i'm still working with doit to
provide

04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:03:45.910 --> 04:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
some wi-fi for the residents because
 
04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:03:50.150 --> 04:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
really desperate for that kind of
 
04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
information access
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
so just to share a story the veterans
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
home um
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
has their clients all contract
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
separately for wi-fi services internet
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
access and uh there's been a number of
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
complaints originating from the veterans
 
04:04:10.389 --> 04:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
they get really bad wi-fi service
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
because of all of the contention
 
04:04:17.910 --> 04:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the and competing for the limited
 
04:04:17.920 --> 04:04:18.830 align:start position:0%
in the and competing for the limited
wi-fi

04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
wi-fi
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
there so i think d.o.t had a solution
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
doit had a solution for the veterans
 
04:04:24.720 --> 04:04:25.590 align:start position:0%
doit had a solution for the veterans
home

04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
but um but the commandant
 
04:04:32.070 --> 04:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
has other reasons not to do it but so
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
so i i just hope that you know given the
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic and all the social isolation
 
04:04:37.349 --> 04:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
we're finding
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
ways to to to let our patients
 
04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
interact with the outside world and it
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like that's a priority to you too
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely we actually just um last
 
04:04:47.520 --> 04:04:48.070 align:start position:0%
absolutely we actually just um last
thursday

04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
thursday
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
received a set cell phone booster
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
that we can put on our roof because we
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
also don't have cell phones up here
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
um we have no reception um so that's
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
even more limiting so we're trying
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
everything we can
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
wow going back to the 1950s
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
i also just want to add to we've been
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
researching some
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
potential grant funding opportunities to
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
try to bring um
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
tele teleconferencing video conferencing
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
type equipment
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
tickling cliff for both educational and
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh patient
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
patient uh uses so are you working with
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
dartmouth to do that
 
04:05:30.309 --> 04:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
because they they access a lot of grants
 
04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
or one how are you never mind just let's
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
let's keep going i'm sorry
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
i still want to try to finish in 45
 
04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
minutes if possible
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.150 --> 04:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh so the last primary accounting unit
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
for glencliff is their maintenance
 
04:05:48.150 --> 04:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
um uh again there were some prioritized
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
needs in here relative to payroll
 
04:05:55.750 --> 04:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
and uh really the rest of the accounting
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
unit remains
 
04:06:00.500 --> 04:06:00.510 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.510 --> 04:06:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay the rest of glencliff's accounting
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
units are really
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
um relative to things like capital
 
04:06:16.319 --> 04:06:17.030 align:start position:0%
um relative to things like capital
projects

04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
or um um unemployment
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
really things that we don't have a a
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
whole lot of control over so
 
04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:29.050 align:start position:0%
so that's really for glencliff
 
04:06:29.050 --> 04:06:32.070 align:start position:0%
so that's really for glencliff
[Music]

take care so
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
up next is the division uh for
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh which the director of that is katya
 
04:07:35.279 --> 04:07:36.389 align:start position:0%
uh which the director of that is katya
fox

04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
fox
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
and i believe kevin is in process of
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
this division comprises of three
 
04:07:48.309 --> 04:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
separate bureaus
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
so i don't believe we will finish this
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%

she does a great job
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
um why don't you think about giving us
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
30 minutes and then we'll have to carry
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%

04:08:27.110 --> 04:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
ready willing and able to step in and
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
04:08:32.070 --> 04:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
as they arise given the fact that we
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
only have 30 minutes
 
04:08:36.630 --> 04:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
i think what we'll do is we'll try to
 
04:08:37.510 --> 04:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
get through
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
one of the bureaus but i'm not sure if
 
04:08:41.429 --> 04:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
that's going to be possible based on the
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
questions that you have
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
and the enormity of the division in the
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
division's work
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
so jane jackson is our finance director
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
and she reports directly to karen
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i am in my office in concord
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
if that matters to anyone so
 
04:09:02.790 --> 04:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
what i want to do is just talk a little
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
bit so this is the agenda you've seen
 
04:09:04.479 --> 04:09:04.790 align:start position:0%
bit so this is the agenda you've seen
this

04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
now several times um the
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
division so the overview it's was
 
04:09:11.359 --> 04:09:11.990 align:start position:0%
division so the overview it's was
created

04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
created
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
five years ago and the idea was to bring
 
04:09:15.840 --> 04:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
five years ago and the idea was to bring
together

04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services and supports
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
at the community level
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
so this morning you heard from new
 
04:09:26.229 --> 04:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital which is at the acute
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
psychiatric level and then you just
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
heard from going cliff which is more the
 
04:09:30.640 --> 04:09:31.750 align:start position:0%
heard from going cliff which is more the
long-term

04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh services that are are needed in this
 
04:09:35.040 --> 04:09:36.070 align:start position:0%
uh services that are are needed in this
system

04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
and so we're really focused on the
 
04:09:39.990 --> 04:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
community-based systems
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
and that includes um there's no vision
 
04:09:45.110 --> 04:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
or mission statement here
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
however our driving forces right now
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
are all about systems transformation
 
04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
so in the middle of a pandemic we're
 
04:09:56.710 --> 04:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
trans trying to transform
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
our systems to better address the needs
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
of individuals and families
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
who are struggling with behavioral
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
so we have the bureau of drug and
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol services and i'm going to give
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
you a little buzzwords as a way to
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
cue you so that you know when you hear
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
something in the news you know what
 
04:10:19.110 --> 04:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
how it relates to this presentation so
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
opioid overdoses and opioid deaths
 
04:10:23.920 --> 04:10:24.469 align:start position:0%
opioid overdoses and opioid deaths
that's

04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
what you would commonly think about when
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
you hear about the drug
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
and alcohol services bureau
 
04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
they are working very hard we are all
 
04:10:36.070 --> 04:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
working very hard
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
on a action plan um that was developed
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's a two-year action plan that ends at
 
04:10:42.080 --> 04:10:42.710 align:start position:0%
it's a two-year action plan that ends at
the

04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
end of this calendar year and it really
 
04:10:45.520 --> 04:10:46.469 align:start position:0%
end of this calendar year and it really
focuses

04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
focuses
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
on addressing the need to reduce
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
the incidence of deaths and
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
the misuse of alcohol and other drugs
 
04:11:00.550 --> 04:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
for children's behavioral health you had
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversation about that this
 
04:11:02.560 --> 04:11:03.750 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversation about that this
morning

04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
that is also undergoing a significant
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
systems transformation
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that is um really known and governed
 
04:11:11.760 --> 04:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
and that is um really known and governed
by

04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
the system of care another buzzword that
 
04:11:16.469 --> 04:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
you hear about
 
04:11:18.149 --> 04:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
and we're going to go into more details
 
04:11:19.510 --> 04:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:11:23.189 --> 04:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
and then the 10-year mental health plan
 
04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
so that encompasses both children and
 
04:11:26.159 --> 04:11:27.269 align:start position:0%
so that encompasses both children and
adults

04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
adults
 
04:11:30.149 --> 04:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
and that is governing a lot of the work
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
and most importantly for this
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
particular committee it is where
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of our funding is directed
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
so you're going to see some growth in
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
funding and that's because the need is
 
04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
so great
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
and the opportunity is really standing
 
04:11:50.070 --> 04:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
before us
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
to continue to transform the system we
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to just keep adding services
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
and nibbling at the edges
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
we want to rethink of everything that we
 
04:12:01.840 --> 04:12:02.550 align:start position:0%
we want to rethink of everything that we
do

04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
so that we're not just expecting um to
 
04:12:05.439 --> 04:12:05.830 align:start position:0%
so that we're not just expecting um to
add

04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
add
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
and add an ad to a system that's already
 
04:12:08.399 --> 04:12:09.269 align:start position:0%
and add an ad to a system that's already
stressed

04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
stressed
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
we want to transform that system and
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
have it be
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
so the first unit you'll see is the
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
behavioral health policy unit
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
there are six of us um in this
 
04:12:25.760 --> 04:12:27.349 align:start position:0%
there are six of us um in this
particular

04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:12:30.550 --> 04:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
area and it's division wide and
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
this is really the area that provides
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
technical assistance
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
to not only um within the department
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
and within our division but also with
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so a lot of this
 
04:12:46.309 --> 04:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
work in these positions are focused
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
on grant writing and
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
medicaid policy we've had the
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
you'll be hearing more about in the
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid presentation
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
about what you probably are aware of
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
which is the integrated delivery
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
networks in the 1115
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
transformation waiver um that has been
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
going on for five years
 
04:13:13.030 --> 04:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
and there also is legislative work
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
um so we have a
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
person who's dedicated to being our
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
and working with all of you on important
 
04:13:23.279 --> 04:13:24.950 align:start position:0%
and working with all of you on important
initiatives

04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.750 --> 04:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
so here is this is just within the
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
division this isn't the entire division
 
04:13:35.429 --> 04:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
including all the bureaus
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
this is just in this um accounting
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
section and again you'll see some growth
 
04:13:42.159 --> 04:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
section and again you'll see some growth
there

04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
and if you have specific questions jane
 
04:13:45.920 --> 04:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
and if you have specific questions jane
jackson

04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
jackson
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
can answer them but what you'll see
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
is that those federal funds are part of
 
04:13:54.720 --> 04:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
is that those federal funds are part of
a

04:13:55.110 --> 04:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
interagency transfer that actually
 
04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
directly relate to new hampshire
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
hospital and to
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
glencliff home so you'll see
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
where those funds are for medicaid
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
payments that go to those two facilities
 
04:14:15.510 --> 04:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of it is the staffing
 
04:14:15.520 --> 04:14:16.070 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of it is the staffing
and

04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:20.830 --> 04:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
the ancillary required financing for
 
04:14:20.840 --> 04:14:22.630 align:start position:0%
the ancillary required financing for
that

04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i i put this slide really early on so
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
we could cut to the chase about the
 
04:14:29.110 --> 04:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go into it um if
 
04:14:31.359 --> 04:14:32.389 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go into it um if
necessary

04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
as we get into the various bureaus so
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
additional guardianship slots um
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
we have guardianships that are required
 
04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
under law
 
04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
and these are typically individuals that
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
you may think of at new hampshire
 
04:14:48.319 --> 04:14:49.269 align:start position:0%
you may think of at new hampshire
hospital

04:14:49.269 --> 04:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:14:52.630 --> 04:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
who need assistance and
 
04:14:55.830 --> 04:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
help in managing their finances for
 
04:14:55.840 --> 04:14:56.870 align:start position:0%
help in managing their finances for
example

04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
and so a guardian will be appointed by
 
04:15:00.389 --> 04:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
the court
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
and i have the numbers um i won't go
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
over them now
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
but this would provide for an additional
 
04:15:06.880 --> 04:15:07.830 align:start position:0%
but this would provide for an additional
10

04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
10
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
slots um for that so that was one of our
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
that was not funded and
 
04:15:18.309 --> 04:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
hold on a second you can get 10 slots
 
04:15:19.269 --> 04:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
funded with 30
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
000 or an or is 30 000
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
just the additional amount that you need
 
04:15:27.429 --> 04:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
that you didn't get
 
04:15:29.910 --> 04:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
so it's ten new slots for thirty
 
04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars believe it or not the
 
04:15:31.600 --> 04:15:31.990 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars believe it or not the
rate

04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
rate
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
is very low because um typically those
 
04:15:38.630 --> 04:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
guardianship services um aren't
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
just a surprising amount but um all
 
04:15:46.080 --> 04:15:47.670 align:start position:0%
just a surprising amount but um all
right

04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:15:50.469 --> 04:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
and then the other prioritized need was
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
one and a half million dollars for
 
04:15:52.319 --> 04:15:53.429 align:start position:0%
one and a half million dollars for
stabilization

04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
services um as we look at
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
streamlining and transforming our
 
04:15:59.439 --> 04:16:00.309 align:start position:0%
streamlining and transforming our
emergency

04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
services response and that gets into
 
04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative wallner's comments and i
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
believe representative norgren talked
 
04:16:08.000 --> 04:16:09.189 align:start position:0%
believe representative norgren talked
about

04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:16:11.110 --> 04:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis and was asking about
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
so we're transforming the approach that
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
is currently used
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
um again not adding services and
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
expecting more and more and more
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
but really re-looking at how we provide
 
04:16:25.269 --> 04:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
those services
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
and where and so this funding
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
would have supported that continued
 
04:16:31.040 --> 04:16:34.149 align:start position:0%
would have supported that continued
effort

04:16:34.149 --> 04:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
so katya before you jump into the
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
bureaus if you can just go back one
 
04:16:38.159 --> 04:16:39.429 align:start position:0%
bureaus if you can just go back one
slide

04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
slide
 
04:16:41.910 --> 04:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
chair would you like to go over these
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
four accounting units which are related
 
04:16:45.030 --> 04:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
to the division as a whole
 
04:16:48.070 --> 04:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
before we go into the bureau's um and
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
the bureau information
 
04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
let's let's go ahead into a bureau
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
because this sounds like it's
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
fairly routine
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
they are pretty straightforward
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
accounting units okay
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
all right let's see i was going to ask i
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
was going to ask
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
mrs fox which part of dhhs she thinks we
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
should get that 1.5 million a year but
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:20.229 --> 04:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
i would defer to commissioner shibanet
 
04:17:20.239 --> 04:17:20.790 align:start position:0%
i would defer to commissioner shibanet
and

04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
cfo rounds on which area should
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
get those funds um but this is um
 
04:17:33.269 --> 04:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
so um the bureau of drug and alcohol
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
services the aforementioned
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
um so it's a single state substance
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
misuse authority
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
which is designated by the federal
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
government we have to have a single
 
04:17:47.189 --> 04:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
state authority
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
for drug and alcohol services and we
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
also have one for mental health
 
04:17:56.309 --> 04:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
and so this one is for
 
04:17:59.910 --> 04:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
for the drug and alcohol services and
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is essentially the
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
slide that shows the services that are
 
04:18:06.239 --> 04:18:07.030 align:start position:0%
slide that shows the services that are
provided

04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so you start with prevention and i
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
know you're going to be talking a lot
 
04:18:13.750 --> 04:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
more about prevention
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to public health but also
 
04:18:16.960 --> 04:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
when it comes to public health but also
from

04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:18:20.950 --> 04:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
the other the other divisions um
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
crisis and acute services so we think
 
04:18:23.359 --> 04:18:24.309 align:start position:0%
crisis and acute services so we think
about

04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
everyone knows the word detox
 
04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
and that kind of immobile response which
 
04:18:30.399 --> 04:18:30.870 align:start position:0%
and that kind of immobile response which
also

04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
occurs in the um suv arena
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
outpatient and residential treatment i
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
think we all know what that is
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
peer recovery support services very
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
critical to the work that
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
everyone does in ongoing recovery
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
from a substance use disorder and then
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
family support services which
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
i know that we've seen ken norton a
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
couple of times
 
04:18:59.110 --> 04:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
and know that family supports are
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
so what a one of those areas entail
 
04:19:15.750 --> 04:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
and so we have prevention and education
 
04:19:18.550 --> 04:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
and population level prevention i'm just
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
gonna go
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
and look at my cheat sheets these the
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
information that i'm providing
 
04:19:26.710 --> 04:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
is also detailed much more in our
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
briefing book
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
um so if you have some questions
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
especially since
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're unlikely to finish um the entire
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
division today
 
04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
sorry chair um i don't think it's gonna
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
happen um
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
but i um it may give an opportunity for
 
04:19:42.630 --> 04:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
you to be able to look
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
in more detail at what i'm presenting
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
this afternoon a reasonable goal to
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
finish this bureau
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
before shutting down for the day
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's reasonable and what i want
 
04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:19:59.110 --> 04:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
is get to the questions um rather than
 
04:19:59.120 --> 04:19:59.429 align:start position:0%
is get to the questions um rather than
just

04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
prattle on on something that may not be
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
of interest when you may have specific
 
04:20:04.239 --> 04:20:05.269 align:start position:0%
of interest when you may have specific
questions

04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
um so to the extent that i can
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
accommodate that
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
and really go with the flow just let me
 
04:20:11.359 --> 04:20:14.710 align:start position:0%
and really go with the flow just let me
know

04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
so population level strategy so that's
 
04:20:19.110 --> 04:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
really looking
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
at community mobilization and engagement
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
promoting healthy behaviors through
 
04:20:30.389 --> 04:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
social media and through other means
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
and increasing awareness to about
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
access and the services that can be
 
04:20:35.680 --> 04:20:37.189 align:start position:0%
access and the services that can be
provided

04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
direct prevention which gets a little
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
bit more detailed
 
04:20:46.229 --> 04:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
into people who are at risk or may have
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
already been engaging in substance
 
04:20:48.880 --> 04:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
already been engaging in substance
misuse

04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
misuse
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
and then and i can give examples of
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
those if anyone
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
wants to know what those are and then
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
when we get into surveillance
 
04:21:00.710 --> 04:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is where you hear i know that it
 
04:21:02.469 --> 04:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
used to be a lot more common
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
um that you would see a news story where
 
04:21:06.550 --> 04:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
the liquor enforcement would do
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
those checks and really determine
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
whether miners were
 
04:21:20.830 --> 04:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
accessing alcohol through that means
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
through uh purchase um through whatever
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
means that may be
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
so there were those uh checks that um
 
04:21:28.159 --> 04:21:29.030 align:start position:0%
so there were those uh checks that um
happen

04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
and also surveillance includes drop
 
04:21:32.000 --> 04:21:32.790 align:start position:0%
and also surveillance includes drop
boxes

04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
boxes
 
04:21:35.030 --> 04:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
which we're all familiar with and have
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
really increased
 
04:21:40.870 --> 04:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
over time crisis intervention and
 
04:21:40.880 --> 04:21:41.990 align:start position:0%
over time crisis intervention and
treatment

04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:21:45.269 --> 04:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
very very self-explanatory
 
04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
there have been millions of dollars that
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
have been afforded to the state through
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:21:52.870 --> 04:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
opioid response grant and
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
we've been deploying those services
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
through what you know
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll get into this a little bit
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
more as the doorway program with the
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
nine doorways across the state
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
we've had treatment services and so this
 
04:22:07.199 --> 04:22:07.510 align:start position:0%
we've had treatment services and so this
is

04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
your traditional thinking about
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
residential treatment which includes say
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
farnum center or phoenix house
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
and southeastern services those are the
 
04:22:22.000 --> 04:22:23.750 align:start position:0%
and southeastern services those are the
inpatient

04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
inpatient
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
services that we provide and they're at
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
different levels of care
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
and the outpatient treatment so that's
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
part of what's in this treatment
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
box and then impaired driving we always
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
forget that
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
um our actually our bureau
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
is in charge in overseeing the impaired
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
driving program
 
04:22:51.269 --> 04:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
and again for your
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
purposes we talked about people paying
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
for services
 
04:22:57.030 --> 04:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about new hampshire
 
04:22:58.950 --> 04:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
hospital the
 
04:23:01.830 --> 04:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
individuals who are court ordered into
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
this particular program
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
pay for the program it's a self-pay and
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
it is um self-funded
 
04:23:13.110 --> 04:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
so to speak do their payments exceed the
 
04:23:13.120 --> 04:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
so to speak do their payments exceed the
costs

04:23:13.750 --> 04:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
are you making a profit in other words
 
04:23:19.110 --> 04:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we're making a
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
profit i
 
04:23:22.710 --> 04:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that it is a break-even
 
04:23:22.720 --> 04:23:26.149 align:start position:0%
i believe that it is a break-even
situation

04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
government is generally not permitted to
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
make a profit so
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
i think well we call it something
 
04:23:32.399 --> 04:23:33.189 align:start position:0%
i think well we call it something
different

04:23:33.189 --> 04:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
but that there's a surplus of funds that
 
04:23:38.790 --> 04:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
are reallocated to other cost centers
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
right no we that isn't the case in this
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
and then the supports that are provided
 
04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier as people go through
 
04:23:53.590 --> 04:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
the continuum and go through recovery
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
and that includes the recovery community
 
04:23:55.479 --> 04:23:57.110 align:start position:0%
and that includes the recovery community
organizations

04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
which are overseen by a
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
facilitating organization that provides
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
04:24:06.070 --> 04:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
administrative support for these
 
04:24:06.080 --> 04:24:07.189 align:start position:0%
administrative support for these
organizations

04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:24:10.469 --> 04:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
i believe we're up to 14 to 16
 
04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
of these organizations across the state
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
and again
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
to orient you we have sos
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast and we have navigating
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
recovery in the lakes region
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
and a number of other organizations that
 
04:24:25.830 --> 04:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
cover the entire state hope for new
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire recovery
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
in manchester and berlin those
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
programs are providing peer support
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
so rather than having a
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
medical model it is a model that's
 
04:24:41.830 --> 04:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
and supported
 
04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
mostly by volunteers there are some paid
 
04:24:48.880 --> 04:24:49.349 align:start position:0%
mostly by volunteers there are some paid
staff

04:24:49.349 --> 04:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
staff
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
but there are many many people in
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
recovery who want to give back
 
04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
and they act as peer coaches with these
 
04:24:55.520 --> 04:24:57.590 align:start position:0%
and they act as peer coaches with these
organizations

04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:24:59.910 --> 04:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
we have family support services these
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
are support groups
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
that are held throughout the state for
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
our families
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
and then recovery housing and so
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
we have been able to over the um
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
last couple of years put in some
 
04:25:14.640 --> 04:25:15.670 align:start position:0%
last couple of years put in some
standards

04:25:15.670 --> 04:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
recovery housing and there is actually a
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
statute now that
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
only ones that have gone through
 
04:25:27.750 --> 04:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
this certification process are able to
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
receive state funds
 
04:25:31.030 --> 04:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
so we tighten the controls there are a
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns about
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
standards for this particular level of
 
04:25:35.279 --> 04:25:36.149 align:start position:0%
standards for this particular level of
housing

04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
and those have been instilled and tied
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
so is there a supplementary slide
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
also in this deck that deals with all of
 
04:25:48.640 --> 04:25:49.750 align:start position:0%
also in this deck that deals with all of
the

04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
metrics of success how you how you're
 
04:25:52.640 --> 04:25:53.910 align:start position:0%
metrics of success how you how you're
determining

04:25:53.910 --> 04:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
determining
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
how successful you are or what kind of
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
workload you're dealing with
 
04:26:01.110 --> 04:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
i would say there's just a sampling
 
04:26:02.070 --> 04:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
there is not
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
a detailed um i can provide we can
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
provide additional information but it
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
was way too much
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
to include in a compressed time frame
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay if they don't already exist it just
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
may be a good
 
04:26:19.030 --> 04:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
homework assignment over the next year
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
or two
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
sure and we've been working very closely
 
04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
in really focusing on outcomes and
 
04:26:27.120 --> 04:26:28.870 align:start position:0%
in really focusing on outcomes and
evaluation

04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
both of the state opioid response grant
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
dollars and grant funded programs as
 
04:26:37.110 --> 04:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
well as our other programs so we have
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
a lot they're just not in a nice neat
 
04:26:40.000 --> 04:26:40.630 align:start position:0%
a lot they're just not in a nice neat
package

04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
package
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
but how about we share what we have
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
and then let you know what our plan is
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
so 125 contracts
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
anyone who has gone through a
 
04:26:58.399 --> 04:26:59.269 align:start position:0%
anyone who has gone through a
contracting

04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
contracting
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
process with us understands what that
 
04:27:02.000 --> 04:27:03.030 align:start position:0%
process with us understands what that
takes

04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
takes
 
04:27:07.349 --> 04:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
um and also what it takes to not only
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
contract and go and get the contract in
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
place but then to
 
04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
oversee those contracts and so
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.110 --> 04:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
statutorily required to carry out the
 
04:27:21.120 --> 04:27:21.990 align:start position:0%
statutorily required to carry out the
decisions

04:27:21.990 --> 04:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
of the governor's commission on alcohol
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
and other drugs and
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
they alone i believe account for
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
maybe up to 50 of those contracts
 
04:27:35.830 --> 04:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
and what we're able to do with the
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
governor's commission funding
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
is braid it with federal funds
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
and with state general funds to be able
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
to support all these services that you
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
see listed here
 
04:27:49.590 --> 04:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
so to what extent are these actually
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
unique contracts versus model contracts
 
04:27:53.110 --> 04:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
minor changes between them so that's a
 
04:27:58.630 --> 04:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's a really good point because it
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
makes it sound very daunting
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
so for example the treatment contracts
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
many of those
 
04:28:07.590 --> 04:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
are the same contract that's only
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
the only difference may be
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of dollars that are awarded
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
in it
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
so that's a core contract and then
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
toggle to address population
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
and other needs in the community
 
04:28:26.469 --> 04:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
but it's still 23 different
 
04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
organizations that we're
 
04:28:30.070 --> 04:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
interacting with and overseeing and
 
04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
managing and auditing and
 
04:28:37.590 --> 04:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
monitoring gets to be the bigger part
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's really important and i
 
04:28:41.910 --> 04:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
know that you had
 
04:28:45.189 --> 04:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
meredith telus here from quality and
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
performance and she talked a lot about
 
04:28:49.670 --> 04:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
what is done in that arena
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and we work side by side with her on
 
04:28:52.000 --> 04:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
and we work side by side with her on
that

04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
so again i said that there would be a
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of um
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
of data that we could provide so this is
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
individuals served and if
 
04:29:09.429 --> 04:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
you want to dive deeper into how do we
 
04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
get to that 80 000 number
 
04:29:14.229 --> 04:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to share that with you
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
prevention is an area where you see
 
04:29:19.110 --> 04:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
where you make the investment that the
 
04:29:19.120 --> 04:29:19.990 align:start position:0%
where you make the investment that the
reward

04:29:19.990 --> 04:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
reward
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
is great a return and i know studies
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
have been done on that
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
and so the more people that we can reach
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
on the prevention and the less
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
number that we have to treat on the
 
04:29:33.359 --> 04:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
number that we have to treat on the
acute

04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
acute
 
04:29:33.840 --> 04:29:38.550 align:start position:0%
acute
side

04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:41.910 --> 04:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
so again the doorways
 
04:29:45.110 --> 04:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is interesting data because you see
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
some dips um and
 
04:29:50.950 --> 04:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
as many of us have already been talking
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
about we've seen
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
changes and some anomalies that we
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have expected to see
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
so we're very pleased that the doorways
 
04:30:04.950 --> 04:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
were able to maintain
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
contact with individuals that they were
 
04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
already serving
 
04:30:11.830 --> 04:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
and keep their doors open which may mean
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
keeping their
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
telephone lines open through telehealth
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to continue to serve
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
individuals and so we saw a big dip
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
and now it's it's starting to come back
 
04:30:23.910 --> 04:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
up again
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
as as we all struggle through and learn
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
to live with
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
this is also very
 
04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
much tied to the pandemic on the number
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
of people who
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
have been able to be in treatment
 
04:30:45.120 --> 04:30:46.229 align:start position:0%
have been able to be in treatment
services

04:30:46.229 --> 04:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
and again it either is because of
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
closures or not closures well closures
 
04:30:57.189 --> 04:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
on a temporary basis where we had to
 
04:30:57.199 --> 04:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
on a temporary basis where we had to
reduce

04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
the census in the provider system
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
for social distancing as people were in
 
04:31:03.359 --> 04:31:04.550 align:start position:0%
for social distancing as people were in
treatment

04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
trying to maintain them in treatment
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
while dealing with all the
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
issues that they needed to deal with
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic so we saw those
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
admissions go
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
down as you'll hear i think from the
 
04:31:21.359 --> 04:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
down as you'll hear i think from the
advocates

04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
advocates
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
and for me right now we anticipate that
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
the demand is going to get
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
very very high in all of the services
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
that we provide through our division
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
and so we know about the
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
liquor sales and um the increase in that
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
we know that um there are many many
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
children who are
 
04:31:48.790 --> 04:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
in uh crisis and um
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
from not being in school and having
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
their social supports
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
and we know that people have prolonged
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
their interaction with our services
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
um because of copen and so they come in
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
at a higher
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
in a more acute level so we're just
 
04:32:08.229 --> 04:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
we're just getting started with our
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
and again this was a very successful um
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
endeavor through the pandemic where
 
04:32:20.950 --> 04:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
the increase in growth of peer recovery
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
support services
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to do that with
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
funds that have been afforded
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
through legislative action as well as
 
04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
the state opioid response
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
and critical dollars from the governor's
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
commission that have supported
 
04:32:43.269 --> 04:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
these organizations
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
how am i doing in time here
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
you tell me to get through this bureau
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
um i think you're on pace
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
good right so these are the positions
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that i'm sure
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard about is that we did have a
 
04:33:01.349 --> 04:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
as we were worried about state revenues
 
04:33:07.830 --> 04:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
and what that was going to mean however
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
that has since been lifted and we're in
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
the process of filling these positions
 
04:33:15.189 --> 04:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
so we were shorthanded and will continue
 
04:33:16.949 --> 04:33:16.959 align:start position:0%
to be shorthanded until all those
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
and then these are just a couple of
 
04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
benchmarks they're not the ones that
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think that you were speaking to mr
 
04:33:29.840 --> 04:33:31.029 align:start position:0%
i think that you were speaking to mr
chair

04:33:31.029 --> 04:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
but they are achievements that we've
 
04:33:37.830 --> 04:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
been very pleased with but we have a lot
 
04:33:40.869 --> 04:33:40.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
so the student assistance programs they
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
engage with you to provide prevention
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
and early intervention services
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
and typically right in the school
 
04:33:53.109 --> 04:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
setting and
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
they were able to continue to have that
 
04:33:55.199 --> 04:33:56.390 align:start position:0%
they were able to continue to have that
contact

04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
contact
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
with students in very creative ways
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
um as schools went remote
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
so this this is a this is a new slide
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
that i've requested so i just thought
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
i'd let you know what i
 
04:34:11.109 --> 04:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
i was thinking when i asked for this
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
and and the way it's been presented in
 
04:34:15.199 --> 04:34:15.590 align:start position:0%
and and the way it's been presented in
in

04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
other dhh slides is that on the left
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
there are the things that drive your
 
04:34:22.000 --> 04:34:22.949 align:start position:0%
there are the things that drive your
workflow

04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
workflow
 
04:34:26.310 --> 04:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh what metrics or
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
client load drive your workload and then
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
on the right
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
what quality measures you're using to
 
04:34:33.750 --> 04:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're doing a good job so the one on
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
the left is how much work the one on the
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
right is
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know how how well are you doing the
 
04:34:41.520 --> 04:34:42.709 align:start position:0%
you know how how well are you doing the
work

04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay so that doesn't quite hit the mark
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
on this i'll go back and look at some of
 
04:34:47.600 --> 04:34:48.709 align:start position:0%
on this i'll go back and look at some of
those

04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:34:51.269 --> 04:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
no it's it's it's in the it's in the you
 
04:34:51.279 --> 04:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
no it's it's it's in the it's in the you
know

04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
the horseshoe range okay
 
04:34:58.709 --> 04:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
quality is always an area that we're
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
striving towards it's something that we
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
all expect
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
um and something that and we owe
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
to the people that we serve and it's
 
04:35:12.230 --> 04:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
something that we continue to work on
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
um and then again the availability
 
04:35:14.561 --> 04:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
um and then again the availability
engagement

04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
in peer recovery support services so
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
um as you saw in the previous slide
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're growing
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
those services and want to continue to
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.949 --> 04:35:34.959 align:start position:0%
so key accomplishments
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
um we have seen a decline in overdose
 
04:35:38.080 --> 04:35:38.789 align:start position:0%
um we have seen a decline in overdose
deaths

04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
um at a time when other states have seen
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
increases so we feel that we're making
 
04:35:46.070 --> 04:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
progress but
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
the death that is due to an overdose
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
is one too many and we're going to keep
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
going and going and going
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
on that and not take our foot off the
 
04:35:56.400 --> 04:35:57.910 align:start position:0%
on that and not take our foot off the
pedal

04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
pedal
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
and we are able to very rapidly just as
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
the state employees were able to
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
quickly and i think dave readers
 
04:36:08.709 --> 04:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
probably talked about this
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
go to remote work we've been able to
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
work with our providers who've been
 
04:36:15.680 --> 04:36:16.869 align:start position:0%
work with our providers who've been
amazing

04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
and being able to make sure that they
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
could maintain
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
services and keep in touch with the
 
04:36:25.750 --> 04:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
clients that they serve
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
um so there's more doorway information
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
they distribute naloxone that has been
 
04:36:33.680 --> 04:36:34.310 align:start position:0%
they distribute naloxone that has been
critical

04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
critical
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
in addressing the overdose deaths that
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
that intervention
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
um has made a real difference um
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
you know let's see i'll just kind of go
 
04:36:45.990 --> 04:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
through this quickly so that we
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
just about ten more minutes okay so for
 
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
prevention um
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the governor's
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
commission decided to do
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
when its funding was increased in the
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
to 10 million dollars per year was to
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
invest in prevention because that's the
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
area that we all have to look to
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
when we're making really tough decisions
 
04:37:19.349 --> 04:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
about budgets
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
and so they did a
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
investment that they referred to as
 
04:37:26.310 --> 04:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
double down
 
04:37:29.349 --> 04:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
on prevention and we're seeing
 
04:37:34.170 --> 04:37:34.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.180 --> 04:37:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
so a sam so the american society of
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
addiction medicine
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
hat is a criteria that sets the level of
 
04:37:42.959 --> 04:37:43.750 align:start position:0%
hat is a criteria that sets the level of
care

04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that is a state requirement and how
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
we all work to determine
 
04:37:53.910 --> 04:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
um if how long and
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
what type of treatment someone needs as
 
04:37:56.160 --> 04:37:57.189 align:start position:0%
what type of treatment someone needs as
they

04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:38:00.310 --> 04:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
enter into the system so we used to call
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
them 28 day programs
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
and similar time stamped
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
programs now we look at these the acm
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
criteria and determine if someone can
 
04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
move through it
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
more quickly or needs more time to get
 
04:38:18.639 --> 04:38:19.429 align:start position:0%
more quickly or needs more time to get
through

04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
on that stage in their recovery
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then um this is a
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
an e um an i.t area that we've looked at
 
04:38:37.269 --> 04:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
challenges um as we all know that there
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
continues to be
 
04:38:47.189 --> 04:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
the um lack of community acceptance in
 
04:38:47.199 --> 04:38:47.830 align:start position:0%
the um lack of community acceptance in
some

04:38:47.830 --> 04:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
areas um in substance misuse services
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
which then impacts our providers ability
 
04:38:57.670 --> 04:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
to stand up services in particular
 
04:38:57.680 --> 04:38:59.189 align:start position:0%
to stand up services in particular
communities

04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's workforce issues um not the
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
first time you've heard that not the
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
last time
 
04:39:06.789 --> 04:39:06.799 align:start position:0%
you'll hear that and then the
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
um rapid growth
 
04:39:12.470 --> 04:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the continuum of care so while we've
 
04:39:12.480 --> 04:39:13.429 align:start position:0%
of the continuum of care so while we've
been

04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
very grateful for the funding and the
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
support to grow
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
and transform this system it requires a
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
lot of work
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
and a lot of work from a lot of people
 
04:39:25.119 --> 04:39:25.510 align:start position:0%
and a lot of work from a lot of people
um

04:39:25.510 --> 04:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:28.709 --> 04:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
and so that's been a challenge um as
 
04:39:28.719 --> 04:39:29.590 align:start position:0%
and so that's been a challenge um as
we've

04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
we've
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.629 --> 04:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
budget so i'm going to linger on this
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
and ask if you have specific questions
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
so i would just mention here um the 20
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
20 20 21 in the middle there
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh you're seeing the general funds at 6
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
million and then go to 8.4 and 22.23
 
04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's not um an increase in what has been
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
budgeted because 2020 is showing
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
actuals there and not budgeted if it
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
showed 2020 budget and 2021 budget
 
04:40:05.670 --> 04:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
what you would see is that 6 million
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
number a lot closer to the 8.4
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
like many programs in in 2020 there has
 
04:40:11.760 --> 04:40:12.230 align:start position:0%
like many programs in in 2020 there has
been

04:40:12.230 --> 04:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
federal funds which that's nice what's
 
04:40:23.360 --> 04:40:24.948 align:start position:0%
federal funds which that's nice what's
that

04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that um almost entirely is attributed
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
to the state opioid response funds
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
so um we received a significant
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so right now for example in this
 
04:40:39.430 --> 04:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year we got 28 million
 
04:40:39.440 --> 04:40:40.628 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year we got 28 million
dollars

04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we also had carryover funds from
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
20. so that's where a lot of it comes
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
from we also
 
04:40:51.910 --> 04:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
receive a um the the block grant
 
04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
so samsa provides a block grant for
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
substance misuse
 
04:40:58.868 --> 04:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
as well as for mental health and that is
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
7.2 million dollars
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have received word that we're going
 
04:41:04.708 --> 04:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
to get
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
more funding but have yet to receive the
 
04:41:10.470 --> 04:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
guidance or the notification
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll be needing to bring that forth
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
at some stage in the budget
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
um as we go forward um
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted to point out is
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
other funds
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
um so that's a huge number it's
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
obviously much bigger than
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
general funds and that is primarily the
 
04:41:30.550 --> 04:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
the alcohol and drug commission the five
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
percent from the alcohol revenues is
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
that our
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
profits so what you're saying
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
so karen you want to handle that or you
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
want me to sure i can
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
touch on that yes it but the funding is
 
04:41:44.878 --> 04:41:45.510 align:start position:0%
touch on that yes it but the funding is
actually

04:41:45.510 --> 04:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
um donations from the hospitals oh
 
04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's a different thing okay so uh
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative waller did you give up on
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
me or you still have a question
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
no i'm i'm set thank you she answered it
 
04:42:04.470 --> 04:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
my question is these inc this rather
 
04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
significant increase in federal funds in
 
04:42:08.230 --> 04:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
the next biennium
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
do we have reason to think that they'll
 
04:42:12.310 --> 04:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
continue into the biennium beyond this
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
do we know don't we don't know
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know you know new hampshire has
 
04:42:24.390 --> 04:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
done so well
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
in the state opioid response
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
um that we
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
need that funding to continue that
 
04:42:34.320 --> 04:42:35.190 align:start position:0%
need that funding to continue that
momentum

04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
momentum
 
04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
however the fundamental formula under
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
state opioid response
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
has been based on our numbers and how
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're how many
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths we've had um so
 
04:42:47.670 --> 04:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully that formula doesn't change
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
and that will continue
 
04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to receive these funds but
 
04:42:51.440 --> 04:42:51.830 align:start position:0%
to be able to receive these funds but
that

04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
is really a subject for congress to
 
04:42:55.440 --> 04:42:59.590 align:start position:0%
is really a subject for congress to
tackle

04:42:59.590 --> 04:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this slide want
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay the good and the bad so
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
um if we were to get a five percent
 
04:43:12.638 --> 04:43:13.350 align:start position:0%
um if we were to get a five percent
increase

04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
i would emphasize the bottom one on that
 
04:43:20.400 --> 04:43:20.708 align:start position:0%
i would emphasize the bottom one on that
uh

04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:23.670 --> 04:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
top of the top three so rather than
 
04:43:25.750 --> 04:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on beta staff which is
 
04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
really really important as you can see
 
04:43:28.160 --> 04:43:28.948 align:start position:0%
really really important as you can see
from

04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
what we're required to carry out but i
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
think it also looks at
 
04:43:35.350 --> 04:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
sustaining the new initiative so your
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
point is
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know is that federal funding going
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
to continue so that we can sustain
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
um the current structure in the current
 
04:43:43.280 --> 04:43:44.230 align:start position:0%
um the current structure in the current
system

04:43:44.230 --> 04:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
um the five percent would help us in
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
that arena
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
um and then the um workforce development
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
again you've already heard about that
 
04:43:57.190 --> 04:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and we'd be able to continue
 
04:43:57.200 --> 04:43:57.590 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and we'd be able to continue
to

04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
invest in workforce so
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
the um the bed would be
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
that we would reduce staff and we would
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
need to
 
04:44:12.310 --> 04:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
look at cutting existing programs
 
04:44:15.510 --> 04:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
for example um some of those contracts
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about
 
04:44:20.550 --> 04:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
that are funded through all those
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
graded sources we would have to look at
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
those in the general funds that are
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
committed to those
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if those would able to
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
be able to be sustained
 
04:44:33.830 --> 04:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
through federal funding and through the
 
04:44:35.670 --> 04:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
governor's commission
 
04:44:37.990 --> 04:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
which are very hesitant the governor's
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
commission to invest in anything
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the state is not supporting on its
 
04:44:43.440 --> 04:44:44.550 align:start position:0%
that the state is not supporting on its
own

04:44:44.550 --> 04:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:44:48.390 --> 04:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
sure and also i'm sorry
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't finish your thought go forward um
 
04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say we do have a
 
04:44:53.830 --> 04:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort requirement for
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
our federal
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh block grant the 7.2 that i mentioned
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we have always have to look to make
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we're meeting that
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
so my general observation on this slide
 
04:45:08.718 --> 04:45:09.190 align:start position:0%
so my general observation on this slide
is

04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
these are nice concepts but i don't see
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
anything measurable here
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't know how to evaluate
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
what these words mean in terms of
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
be happy to come back with something
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
more definitive if
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
that is your pleasure i think
 
04:45:32.310 --> 04:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
i think we'll need it because every
 
04:45:33.910 --> 04:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
program is going to have to
 
04:45:35.350 --> 04:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
really be looked at from this
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
perspective and the
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
better each program is able to
 
04:45:39.360 --> 04:45:40.550 align:start position:0%
better each program is able to
articulate

04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
articulate
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
something that can be measured uh i
 
04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
think it just makes their argument
 
04:45:44.798 --> 04:45:49.270 align:start position:0%
think it just makes their argument
stronger

04:45:49.270 --> 04:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's my thought but every committee
 
04:45:52.948 --> 04:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
member has her own
 
04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
what else um we could take the actual
 
04:45:59.600 --> 04:46:00.070 align:start position:0%
what else um we could take the actual
dollar

04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
amount and then really um drill down on
 
04:46:04.390 --> 04:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
that of what that five percent
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:10.150 --> 04:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
so here are the accounting units and
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:20.470 --> 04:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
to look at an accounting sheet does
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
somebody have an accounting sheet
 
04:46:25.110 --> 04:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
for us to look at why not so katya if
 
04:46:26.550 --> 04:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
you want to stop sharing i'll go ahead
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
and share
 
04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
the accounting units if i could just
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
break in for a second here i'm not sure
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
if you saw the
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
email representative edwards but the
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
gopher meeting has been postponed until
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
friday so i'm not sure if that changes
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
your plans or not
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
it could it depends on if representative
 
04:46:45.270 --> 04:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
walner and wyler were looking for an
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
excuse to leave well
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
thanks mr ripple thanks we've got to get
 
04:46:56.550 --> 04:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
through this one time or another if that
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
gopher meetings on friday fine
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
we'll keep going all right let's go
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
ahead let's let's go ahead and look at
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
great okay so we're going to start on
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%

04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
which is accounting unit 2070
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i would just mention that jane
 
04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
jackson is also on the line she is the
 
04:47:22.470 --> 04:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
finance director uh for the division of
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
behavioral health and you will also see
 
04:47:25.750 --> 04:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
her with the division of long-term
 
04:47:27.670 --> 04:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
supports and services
 
04:47:29.830 --> 04:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
so the first say hello to jane jackson
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
because i haven't seen her in about
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
25 years when she worked at rockingham
 
04:47:33.520 --> 04:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
25 years when she worked at rockingham
county

04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
we did steal here from rockingham county
 
04:47:43.990 --> 04:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
and are very grateful
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
for that knows the numbers very well yes
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
she has been a great addition to our
 
04:47:50.708 --> 04:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
team we're very thankful
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
so accounting unit 2070 is program
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
operations for
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh bureau of drug and alcohol services
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
so this is where the bureau chief it's
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
the administrative
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
can we on this one go down to the the
 
04:48:13.440 --> 04:48:14.150 align:start position:0%
can we on this one go down to the the
personnel

04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
leveling from uh budget to budget right
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
yeah right in there
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
so we've got a plus up of just one
 
04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes and i i believe that i provided all
 
04:48:26.550 --> 04:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
the detail to kevin
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
of all of the position moves throughout
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
so is this a position move or is this a
 
04:48:34.638 --> 04:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
so is this a position move or is this a
new

04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
creation was this a conversion
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
gene or was this a move um this would
 
04:48:42.628 --> 04:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
a ps4 that's new for um
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
help with recovery initiatives
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
so was it moved from somewhere else
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
though or was it a temporary position
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
that we converted to permanent
 
04:48:58.990 --> 04:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
um i believe it was moved from um
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
78.77 we had a few positions that were
 
04:49:02.080 --> 04:49:02.708 align:start position:0%
78.77 we had a few positions that were
budgeted

04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
04:49:06.310 --> 04:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
in the main um 9200 which we kind of
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
briefly went over and skipped the
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
accounting information on
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
and one of them ended up in this
 
04:49:12.480 --> 04:49:13.750 align:start position:0%
and one of them ended up in this
division

04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee on on this
 
04:49:21.920 --> 04:49:23.990 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee on on this
area

04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
this this looks pretty straightforward
 
04:49:26.798 --> 04:49:27.110 align:start position:0%
this this looks pretty straightforward
it's

04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
being driven by the ftes for the most
 
04:49:30.550 --> 04:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
part right
 
04:49:30.560 --> 04:49:34.310 align:start position:0%
part right
yes

04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay let's we can continue okay that
 
04:49:37.360 --> 04:49:38.070 align:start position:0%
okay let's we can continue okay that
accounting

04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
unit's not being used uh 3380 is the
 
04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
next one which is prevention services
 
04:49:54.628 --> 04:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
so the total almost doubles right
 
04:50:04.550 --> 04:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
am i reading that right
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
yes and that looks like it's because of
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
agency income uh
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
gene where is the agency income coming
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
from in
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
in this accounting unit um the agency
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
income in this accounting unit
 
04:50:18.628 --> 04:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
is from the settlement funds not sure if
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
if you are you want to talk a little bit
 
04:50:22.230 --> 04:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
more about those but that is where we
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
budgeted for
 
04:50:26.070 --> 04:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
the settlement funds and you'll note
 
04:50:26.080 --> 04:50:27.110 align:start position:0%
the settlement funds and you'll note
that

04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
um in an upcoming accounting unit um
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
3395 which is
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
our um pfs2
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
grant it's coming to an end and so some
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
of the contract
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
initiatives that were taken care of with
 
04:50:42.550 --> 04:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
that grant funding
 
04:50:45.510 --> 04:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
have been moved to prevention services
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
so you'll see
 
04:50:50.550 --> 04:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
um a jump in the
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
contract line actually now it's up in
 
04:50:54.788 --> 04:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
line 074 which is
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
where we moved some of our contracts to
 
04:50:59.110 --> 04:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
a grants line if they were considered a
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient so you'll see a shift from
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
contracts in 102 from the prior year
 
04:51:08.948 --> 04:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
shifting up to 0.74
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
grants for public assistance that you'll
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
see an increase there and that's what
 
04:51:14.400 --> 04:51:14.788 align:start position:0%
see an increase there and that's what
that

04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
is accounted by so the settlement money
 
04:51:20.788 --> 04:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
is that opioid settlement it's not
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement right
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
no not tobacco sediment opioid sediment
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
which are
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead so that's that's
 
04:51:31.270 --> 04:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's a new source of money
 
04:51:32.550 --> 04:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
past budgets it's a new anticipated
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
source of revenue
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
there are several um i believe lawsuits
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
contain might be able to speak to it
 
04:51:41.280 --> 04:51:42.470 align:start position:0%
contain might be able to speak to it
better

04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:51:46.150 --> 04:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
related to to opioids and
 
04:51:48.550 --> 04:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
anticipated funds that will flow through
 
04:51:49.590 --> 04:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
there is a a opioid abatement advisory
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
commission for which i am the uh
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
designee of the commissioner to sit upon
 
04:52:02.948 --> 04:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
actually our first meeting is friday
 
04:52:04.708 --> 04:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
morning which is why we're starting a
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
little bit late on friday morning
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that committee advises the
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
department on how to spend the funds
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
so this is an area that we we sort of
 
04:52:15.360 --> 04:52:16.948 align:start position:0%
so this is an area that we we sort of
are

04:52:16.948 --> 04:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:52:20.070 --> 04:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
hoping to be able to do that uh
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately the commissioner makes the
 
04:52:23.190 --> 04:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
final decision on how those funds are
 
04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
spent but that commission advises on it
 
04:52:25.360 --> 04:52:26.310 align:start position:0%
spent but that commission advises on it
so

04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
this will be something that we'll be
 
04:52:29.110 --> 04:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
discussing with that commission as time
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
goes on
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
for that settlement money do we have a
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
state matching requirement for any of it
 
04:52:35.990 --> 04:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we know of
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge now it's not a grant
 
04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'll just point out um that this
 
04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
has already received one um
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
or at least it's going to be receiving
 
04:52:55.590 --> 04:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
some funding from
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
mckinsey settlement um and so you'll
 
04:52:58.798 --> 04:52:59.190 align:start position:0%
mckinsey settlement um and so you'll
hear

04:52:59.190 --> 04:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
hear
 
04:53:02.550 --> 04:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
names of the different manufacturers
 
04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
and different players that have been
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
sued over the opioid
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
epidemic and so there already is a chunk
 
04:53:08.958 --> 04:53:09.670 align:start position:0%
epidemic and so there already is a chunk
of

04:53:09.670 --> 04:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:53:12.550 --> 04:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
funding and we anticipate receiving
 
04:53:14.470 --> 04:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
additional funds
 
04:53:16.868 --> 04:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully this spring as we're
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
developing the
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:27.990 --> 04:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions on 33.80
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:35.190 --> 04:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
no just make sure
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
right here at 33.82
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
are these the the alcohol
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
revenues uh they are not the alcohol
 
04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
revenues they
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
are donations from the hospitals
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay so all right so you already said
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that once i thought that was in a
 
04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
different section
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
nope so i think that the uh alcohol
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
revenues that you are thinking of
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
karen they i should point out probably
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
they do pass through us
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
they do pass through and then they get
 
04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
transferred over to
 
04:54:23.670 --> 04:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
the medicaid division that's a good
 
04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:31.990 --> 04:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay the next accounting unit here
 
04:54:37.150 --> 04:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
starts at the bottom of this page
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
3384. i need reading glasses i have not
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
been to the eye doctor since covid
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
and continues on to the next stage i'm
 
04:54:49.990 --> 04:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
having to lean in so much to see the
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
numbers that people can do an
 
04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
ophthalmology exam
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.040 --> 04:55:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:55:10.840 --> 04:55:13.670 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
so this is relatively level funded yes
 
04:55:20.470 --> 04:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
the major change here is the one that
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
we've talked about in a couple other
 
04:55:23.430 --> 04:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
presentations where we're moving it from
 
04:55:23.440 --> 04:55:24.550 align:start position:0%
presentations where we're moving it from
102

04:55:24.550 --> 04:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
102
 
04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
to 74. for better tracking purposes for
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:39.270 --> 04:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
all right are there any questions here
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.868 --> 04:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:51.190 --> 04:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
the next one is 33.85 the drug
 
04:55:55.720 --> 04:55:55.730 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund
 
04:55:55.730 --> 04:55:57.830 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund
[Music]

04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
just a two what is a drug forfeiture
 
04:56:08.798 --> 04:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
just a two what is a drug forfeiture
fund

04:56:09.560 --> 04:56:09.570 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:56:09.570 --> 04:56:14.070 align:start position:0%
fund
[Music]

04:56:14.070 --> 04:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:16.708 --> 04:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting to see if jane responds so
 
04:56:16.718 --> 04:56:17.110 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting to see if jane responds so
that

04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
is um transferred from i believe it
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
is the um department of
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
safety i think it's
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
um department of justice i believe
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'll have to check back but i do that's
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
right and this tied to the civil asset
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
forfeiture so if we bust a drug dealer
 
04:56:37.520 --> 04:56:37.750 align:start position:0%
forfeiture so if we bust a drug dealer
and

04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
take their property that that's what
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
this money is
 
04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
exactly it's a percentage of that that's
 
04:56:44.948 --> 04:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
um to come to us
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay and then starting at the bottom of
 
04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
the page is 3393 which is
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh the treatment drug court grant
 
04:57:02.830 --> 04:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
which i believe ended so it's no longer
 
04:57:02.840 --> 04:57:04.390 align:start position:0%
which i believe ended so it's no longer
budgeted

04:57:04.390 --> 04:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
so then coming down to uh 3395 which is
 
04:57:11.110 --> 04:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
the pfs
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
2 grant which katie was speaking about
 
04:57:13.360 --> 04:57:14.150 align:start position:0%
2 grant which katie was speaking about
earlier

04:57:14.150 --> 04:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
that ends in during fiscal year 22 so
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
we've moved that budgeting in 23 up to
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
that previous accounting unit where you
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
all right moving down to 6935 which is
 
04:57:39.270 --> 04:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
the match grant that also ended in
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 so that is no longer
 
04:57:41.520 --> 04:57:42.550 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 so that is no longer
budgeted

04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
04:57:45.990 --> 04:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
what does matt stand for medically
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.110 --> 04:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
i believe we now use some of the state
 
04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
opioid response funds for
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
some medically assisted treatment
 
04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
contracts which is
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
also the accounting unit on this page
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
here which is 70 40.
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that might have been how we paid for
 
04:58:05.280 --> 04:58:06.070 align:start position:0%
so that might have been how we paid for
narcan

04:58:06.070 --> 04:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
narcan
 
04:58:09.270 --> 04:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
and stuff it's all right
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just talking let's let's keep going
 
04:58:13.990 --> 04:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
70 40.
 
04:58:16.868 --> 04:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
yes this is the large grant that um that
 
04:58:16.878 --> 04:58:18.230 align:start position:0%
yes this is the large grant that um that
you

04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
we were mentioning is what increased the
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
across this bureau we have gone to
 
04:58:24.000 --> 04:58:24.470 align:start position:0%
across this bureau we have gone to
fiscal

04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
committee for fiscal year 21 already to
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
accept those funds and then we are
 
04:58:32.948 --> 04:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:32.958 --> 04:58:36.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:58:36.628 --> 04:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:39.910 --> 04:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like the the fiscal the
 
04:58:39.920 --> 04:58:41.270 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like the the fiscal the
finance

04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
finance
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
committee division three that we
 
04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
probably need
 
04:58:48.070 --> 04:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
a decent understanding of
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
of what is driving that dollar amount
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
and how predictable we see that amount
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the out years
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we need a state match
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
at all for any of that
 
04:59:03.030 --> 04:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
is is this subject to that level of
 
04:59:05.270 --> 04:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
effort of 7.2 million or was that
 
04:59:08.550 --> 04:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.030 --> 04:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
so uh mr chair that was something else
 
04:59:12.070 --> 04:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's our
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
core funding that we've received for
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
years and years and years that currently
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
is about 7.2 million dollars and that's
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
our block grant
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
slr funding does not have any
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort or match it only
 
04:59:30.550 --> 04:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
cannot be used to match medicaid
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
so we can't take the funds and then
 
04:59:36.788 --> 04:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
you know a medicaid expense for opioid
 
04:59:36.798 --> 04:59:37.750 align:start position:0%
you know a medicaid expense for opioid
treatment

04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
and then use these particular funds for
 
04:59:42.550 --> 04:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
that it has to be something that could
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
not be funded otherwise
 
04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay and so the plan for this is
 
04:59:48.320 --> 04:59:49.910 align:start position:0%
okay and so the plan for this is
primarily

04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
there on grants
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
for public assistance and relief
 
04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
so again that class line 74 is the one
 
05:00:00.550 --> 05:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
that we're using
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
to represent sub-recipient monitoring
 
05:00:05.910 --> 05:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
you remember we talked about that last
 
05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
week that um
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
services was unable to uh
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
create a class line for us that said
 
05:00:12.718 --> 05:00:13.990 align:start position:0%
create a class line for us that said
sub-recipient

05:00:13.990 --> 05:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
so that was the class line we used that
 
05:00:19.590 --> 05:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
we've not used previously that made the
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
most sense
 
05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
so just remind me in a sentence or two
 
05:00:24.080 --> 05:00:24.550 align:start position:0%
so just remind me in a sentence or two
what

05:00:24.550 --> 05:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:00:27.350 --> 05:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
what are we paying for with that uh 25
 
05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
so be happy to so um you mentioned
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
naloxone so we're buying naloxone
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
and spending a considerable amount on
 
05:00:39.760 --> 05:00:40.550 align:start position:0%
and spending a considerable amount on
that

05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
we also stood up the doorway programs
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
so and any non-medicaid billable
 
05:00:46.840 --> 05:00:48.070 align:start position:0%
so and any non-medicaid billable
services

05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
that may involve what staff are doing
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
the rent the all of the
 
05:00:58.550 --> 05:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
services to have those doorways open and
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
and as part of the doorway system
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
they enter the system through two one
 
05:01:05.840 --> 05:01:06.788 align:start position:0%
they enter the system through two one
one

05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so we have these nine doorways
 
05:01:11.350 --> 05:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
05:01:14.310 --> 05:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
um that are open typical business hours
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
we have a couple that are open on
 
05:01:15.760 --> 05:01:16.708 align:start position:0%
we have a couple that are open on
weekends

05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
weekends
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
and then we also have after hours
 
05:01:19.120 --> 05:01:20.150 align:start position:0%
and then we also have after hours
coverage

05:01:20.150 --> 05:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so that there is 24 7
 
05:01:26.550 --> 05:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
access and that includes clinicians who
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
are available
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
after hours we also
 
05:01:34.390 --> 05:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
provide as i said
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
the funding for the recovery community
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
organizations they're funded out of that
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
um to a quite a considerable amount
 
05:01:47.910 --> 05:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
we have medication assisted treatment um
 
05:01:47.920 --> 05:01:48.390 align:start position:0%
we have medication assisted treatment um
there

05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
that is a medicaid billable service
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
however there are individuals who
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
are still remain uninsured or
 
05:01:55.600 --> 05:01:56.948 align:start position:0%
are still remain uninsured or
underinsured

05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
underinsured
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
and there are many services that are
 
05:01:59.600 --> 05:02:01.030 align:start position:0%
and there are many services that are
supporting

05:02:01.030 --> 05:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
05:02:03.510 --> 05:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment that are
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
not medicaid
 
05:02:07.110 --> 05:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursed i'd be happy to share with
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
you our grant application which was
 
05:02:09.360 --> 05:02:10.230 align:start position:0%
you our grant application which was
awarded

05:02:10.230 --> 05:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
awarded
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
that has all of the um individual
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
components that make up that 28 million
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
do it in a half a page or are you going
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
to send me a 400 page document
 
05:02:26.070 --> 05:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
i will send you at whatever you would
 
05:02:26.080 --> 05:02:27.350 align:start position:0%
i will send you at whatever you would
like

05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
i could run the half page category okay
 
05:02:31.040 --> 05:02:35.350 align:start position:0%
i could run the half page category okay
okay

05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
25 million is a decent chunk of money
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
curious you know if i i imagine you're
 
05:02:45.030 --> 05:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
using it well
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
we are stretching it to the extent that
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
we can
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
and one thing i should note is that the
 
05:02:51.120 --> 05:02:52.948 align:start position:0%
and one thing i should note is that the
previous

05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
previous
 
05:02:56.788 --> 05:02:56.798 align:start position:0%
opioid response grants were only to
 
05:02:59.350 --> 05:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
assist individuals who were addicted to
 
05:02:59.360 --> 05:03:00.470 align:start position:0%
assist individuals who were addicted to
opioids

05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
and now they've loosened that up to
 
05:03:03.360 --> 05:03:05.190 align:start position:0%
and now they've loosened that up to
stimulants

05:03:05.190 --> 05:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
stimulants
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
as well and you may have seen a recent
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
news article and a lot of talk
 
05:03:14.070 --> 05:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
around different uh tables about
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we have about the
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
rising use of stimulants
 
05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
in the state i did actually
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.830 --> 05:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you we've had a few pages here
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me we had a few pages that didn't
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
have any class
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
10 but they put the class 60
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
for the benefits is it all temp
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
full-time people in these
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes it would be their temporary
 
05:03:47.110 --> 05:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
full-time or temporary part-time in this
 
05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
on this accounting unit it's temporary
 
05:03:48.840 --> 05:03:51.110 align:start position:0%
on this accounting unit it's temporary
full-time

05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
05:03:52.628 --> 05:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
why do they get is that because it's
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
fairly new program and you
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
haven't settled things out yet or what's
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
the reason to have it full time
 
05:04:01.270 --> 05:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
yes we we try not to create permanent
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
positions unless we know that it's
 
05:04:04.230 --> 05:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
permanent funding
 
05:04:06.550 --> 05:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
so we leave it as a temporary position
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
if if it's tempora what we
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
think could be temporary funding so in
 
05:04:12.310 --> 05:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
this case we would not make them
 
05:04:13.750 --> 05:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
permanent positions because we don't
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
know if it's permanent funding
 
05:04:17.830 --> 05:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
i can remember in conversations in the
 
05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
past somebody said well we've got
 
05:04:19.120 --> 05:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
past somebody said well we've got
somebody

05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
in our office with 20 years and he's
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:28.070 --> 05:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
i understand and sometimes it's because
 
05:04:28.080 --> 05:04:28.708 align:start position:0%
i understand and sometimes it's because
that

05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:30.550 --> 05:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know every congress does end up
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
renewing the grant but it
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's it isn't for sure
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome are there any
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay we can go on so that's actually the
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
last accounting unit in bdas so i'm not
 
05:04:48.788 --> 05:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
sure if you want to
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
um switch over to uh
 
05:04:55.990 --> 05:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
to katya and do the next um bureau
 
05:04:58.830 --> 05:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
but yeah we still have two more bureaus
 
05:04:58.840 --> 05:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
but yeah we still have two more bureaus
right

05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
yes and and what does it make more sense
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
to you to do both bureaus and then the
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
accounting or just
 
05:05:07.270 --> 05:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
like we did before do the bureau and
 
05:05:08.550 --> 05:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
then the accounting
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was trying to find my unmute
 
05:05:21.760 --> 05:05:22.788 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was trying to find my unmute
uh

05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
button so typically i feel dead air so
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
if you hear dead air like that you know
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm having some technical difficulty
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right bureau for children's
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral health i think this
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
is going to take us a considerable
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
amount of time because i want to address
 
05:05:43.750 --> 05:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
all the questions that you have and so
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
um kevin i think that we're going to
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
need to bring up
 
05:05:49.270 --> 05:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
erica ungarelli we don't need to
 
05:05:49.280 --> 05:05:50.310 align:start position:0%
erica ungarelli we don't need to
initially

05:05:50.310 --> 05:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
initially
 
05:05:52.628 --> 05:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
but i think the level of conversation
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
that was
 
05:05:57.270 --> 05:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
to be had this morning will necessitate
 
05:05:58.550 --> 05:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
her participation
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
um because she really has the subject
 
05:06:01.440 --> 05:06:02.070 align:start position:0%
um because she really has the subject
matter

05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
matter
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
expertise and the knowledge about this
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
system and what we're trying to achieve
 
05:06:10.470 --> 05:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
so so while all that's happening and if
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a lot let's go ahead
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
and take a five
 
05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
and you guys can you can get everything
 
05:06:50.830 --> 05:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:50.840 --> 05:10:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay um i think we have a quorum
 
05:10:47.190 --> 05:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler's not back yet
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:59.270 --> 05:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
katya something strange happened with
 
05:11:02.230 --> 05:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
your screen sharing i know
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
maybe if you stop share and try again
 
05:11:05.520 --> 05:11:11.910 align:start position:0%
maybe if you stop share and try again
okay

05:11:11.910 --> 05:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:28.390 --> 05:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
you know chris santaniello had dave
 
05:11:32.070 --> 05:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
weeders walk by
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't have the luxury of him being
 
05:11:35.830 --> 05:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
right across
 
05:11:39.270 --> 05:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
from me ah there we go
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
is that better yes okay
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
i can't see any of you but i'm sure
 
05:11:46.150 --> 05:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
you'll stop me when you need
 
05:11:50.230 --> 05:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:11:53.430 --> 05:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
there we go okay so the bureau
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
for children's behavioral health um
 
05:12:00.628 --> 05:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
so we talked a lot about
 
05:12:03.030 --> 05:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
i should say that the bureau of drug and
 
05:12:04.390 --> 05:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol services
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
serves all populations the bureau for
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health was created
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
right after the division
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
was formed so it was established in may
 
05:12:19.590 --> 05:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
of 2016 so not quite five years ago
 
05:12:23.190 --> 05:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
and the idea was to really elevate
 
05:12:26.708 --> 05:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
the children's issues by having a
 
05:12:29.350 --> 05:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
very intense focus on children's
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
behavioral health needs
 
05:12:34.868 --> 05:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
and so the bureau looks at
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
children youth and young adults up to 21
 
05:12:41.430 --> 05:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's a key piece and
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
they have been identified as having a
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
behavioral health concern
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
and requiring services
 
05:12:52.230 --> 05:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
so they bureau
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
overseas the publicly funded programs
 
05:12:59.590 --> 05:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
to treat children and identify them
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
as well as to provide those services
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
and support the families again as we
 
05:13:07.030 --> 05:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
talk about this
 
05:13:08.948 --> 05:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
those family supports are really
 
05:13:08.958 --> 05:13:10.550 align:start position:0%
those family supports are really
important

05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:13:13.830 --> 05:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
and then the bureau also as all of us do
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
oversees the contracts and service
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
providers in the system
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they are being responsive
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
and we are being responsive to the
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
population needs
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
and so as i mentioned on the outset that
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
this is really governed by the system of
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
care values
 
05:13:34.550 --> 05:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
which were established through a very
 
05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
very robust stakeholder process
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
so erica created these slides and i
 
05:13:42.948 --> 05:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
think it
 
05:13:45.990 --> 05:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
really really talks about over the last
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
five years the type of growth that we've
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
seen in this area
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it's been exciting and daunting at
 
05:13:54.390 --> 05:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
so we started off with two staff members
 
05:14:00.550 --> 05:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
and then they had their particular
 
05:14:02.150 --> 05:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
programs that they
 
05:14:06.070 --> 05:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
worked with um for the funding that was
 
05:14:06.080 --> 05:14:07.190 align:start position:0%
worked with um for the funding that was
allocated

05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then the initiatives that were going
 
05:14:09.760 --> 05:14:10.470 align:start position:0%
and then the initiatives that were going
on

05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
two years ago we doubled the staff size
 
05:14:20.230 --> 05:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's a big number
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
except it's small um and we started
 
05:14:24.070 --> 05:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
adding some
 
05:14:27.270 --> 05:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
additional initiatives and some
 
05:14:29.350 --> 05:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
different um accountabilities for this
 
05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
particular bureau
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
and its uh expanse
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:41.430 --> 05:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:45.190 --> 05:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
here we are today so we've essentially
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
doubled the staff again
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
um in recognition of all of the work
 
05:14:50.868 --> 05:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
that was
 
05:14:53.670 --> 05:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
going on and the opportunities that we
 
05:14:53.680 --> 05:14:54.470 align:start position:0%
going on and the opportunities that we
had

05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
to really full fully build out that
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
and so we have as you've seen through
 
05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
all the slides the time community mental
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
health centers
 
05:15:08.550 --> 05:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for any acronym um
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
i had communication with erica earlier
 
05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
i'm like remind me what's this what's
 
05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
this so
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions about any of
 
05:15:17.190 --> 05:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
them please let me know
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
and so then we have care
 
05:15:24.070 --> 05:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
management entities um and they provide
 
05:15:27.190 --> 05:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
intensive in-home supports as well as
 
05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
peer support we have
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
grants treatment providers
 
05:15:37.510 --> 05:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
peer providers we have an assessment
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
tool that's used to look at the
 
05:15:40.948 --> 05:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
strengths and needs
 
05:15:43.990 --> 05:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
of a particular child in their family
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of the mobile
 
05:15:46.320 --> 05:15:47.110 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of the mobile
crisis

05:15:47.110 --> 05:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
implementation that was mentioned
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
we have in-state residential
 
05:15:57.750 --> 05:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
treatment providers and we've developed
 
05:15:57.760 --> 05:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
treatment providers and we've developed
an

05:15:57.990 --> 05:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
infant mental health plan knowing that
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
the earlier that we can start addressing
 
05:16:01.920 --> 05:16:02.628 align:start position:0%
the earlier that we can start addressing
needs

05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
the better there are major initiatives
 
05:16:10.150 --> 05:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
that are going on and they may look like
 
05:16:11.910 --> 05:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
they're separate and distinct but they
 
05:16:11.920 --> 05:16:12.390 align:start position:0%
they're separate and distinct but they
really

05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
are part of that system of care and so
 
05:16:15.990 --> 05:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
actually skip right so cancer cancer's
 
05:16:21.270 --> 05:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
an i.t system that's the clinical
 
05:16:23.110 --> 05:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
assessment system
 
05:16:28.230 --> 05:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
it is it's a it's web-based i believe
 
05:16:32.230 --> 05:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
is that correct erica is erica on
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
that is correct hey aaron nice to see
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
you erica
 
05:16:38.708 --> 05:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
again the director of the bureau for
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health
 
05:16:44.550 --> 05:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative wallner has a question
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
while we're here and i see mobile crisis
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
units there
 
05:16:52.150 --> 05:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
um what has been the delay
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
in getting these um how and we gave you
 
05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the last budget do we give you
 
05:16:59.910 --> 05:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
funding for two
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
i can't remember him let me yeah i'll
 
05:17:04.230 --> 05:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
explain and then eric
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
can talk a little bit about that so
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
we've had three mobile crisis
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
units in the state and i'm going to go
 
05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
right to this one because you'll see
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
statewide mobile crisis right here down
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
at the bottom
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
so we've had those they were established
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
as part of the community mental health
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
agreement which was a court settlement
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
known as amanda d
 
05:17:26.788 --> 05:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
and we're required to set up those three
 
05:17:26.798 --> 05:17:27.350 align:start position:0%
and we're required to set up those three
teams

05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
teams
 
05:17:31.350 --> 05:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
in concord manchester and nashua
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
and we've done that it has been
 
05:17:34.240 --> 05:17:35.350 align:start position:0%
and we've done that it has been
abundantly

05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
abundantly
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
apparent that to address
 
05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
children's needs and to address adults
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
needs families needs
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
all population needs that mobile crisis
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
most effective way to
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
intervene when someone is experiencing a
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
crisis so that they don't end up in the
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
institutions that we've talked about so
 
05:18:03.750 --> 05:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
they don't end up in the emergency
 
05:18:03.760 --> 05:18:04.868 align:start position:0%
they don't end up in the emergency
departments

05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
departments
 
05:18:08.070 --> 05:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
they don't end up in um need
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the hampstead hospital for example
 
05:18:13.990 --> 05:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
level of care that we have that
 
05:18:14.000 --> 05:18:15.030 align:start position:0%
level of care that we have that
intervention

05:18:15.030 --> 05:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the community so everything that we
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
do if we
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um in most circumstances want to do
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the community there are some
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances where it can't happen
 
05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
um so that is the model so as part of
 
05:18:34.150 --> 05:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
sb14 the idea was a statewide children's
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis response we looked at the
 
05:18:37.680 --> 05:18:38.470 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis response we looked at the
funding

05:18:38.470 --> 05:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
05:18:40.868 --> 05:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
we looked at the workforce we looked at
 
05:18:42.628 --> 05:18:42.638 align:start position:0%
the provider capacity
 
05:18:44.550 --> 05:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
and we determined that we could not just
 
05:18:47.830 --> 05:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
stand up a children's mobile crisis
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
and um ignore the rest of the family
 
05:18:50.638 --> 05:18:51.270 align:start position:0%
and um ignore the rest of the family
ignore

05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
ignore
 
05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that there really should be
 
05:18:56.230 --> 05:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
access for all populations to mobile
 
05:18:56.240 --> 05:18:56.708 align:start position:0%
access for all populations to mobile
crisis

05:18:56.708 --> 05:18:56.718 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
statewide and i know that our friend ken
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
norton would be happy to talk about this
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
because he's been
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
um someone who supported this from day
 
05:19:05.920 --> 05:19:07.030 align:start position:0%
um someone who supported this from day
one

05:19:07.030 --> 05:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we developed the
 
05:19:09.680 --> 05:19:10.550 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we developed the
model

05:19:10.550 --> 05:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
model
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
of what that would look like and that
 
05:19:14.470 --> 05:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't include just okay stand up a
 
05:19:14.480 --> 05:19:14.868 align:start position:0%
doesn't include just okay stand up a
team

05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
team
 
05:19:17.590 --> 05:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
and they go and do this work that is
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
part of the transformation that we
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
want to achieve which is to have
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
emergency response and so typically
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
emergency services
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
happen in the emergency department and
 
05:19:32.230 --> 05:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
so that's typically where people are
 
05:19:34.230 --> 05:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
getting that intervention
 
05:19:37.350 --> 05:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
the idea is to transform that and
 
05:19:40.390 --> 05:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
have all those interventions
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the few that are
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
needed happen
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the community happen in people's
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
homes happen
 
05:19:50.948 --> 05:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
in different community settings
 
05:19:54.310 --> 05:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
happen in schools happen at
 
05:19:56.550 --> 05:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps a police department's involved
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
but to have those happen there
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
and not in that
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
emergency department where treatments
 
05:20:05.600 --> 05:20:06.310 align:start position:0%
emergency department where treatments
delayed

05:20:06.310 --> 05:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
delayed
 
05:20:10.230 --> 05:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
and a whole bunch of things cascade
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
and do a trajectory that is not
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily the outcome that we want to
 
05:20:16.470 --> 05:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
see for these children
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
and for the for adults as well
 
05:20:22.868 --> 05:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
so the delay so we were again
 
05:20:26.628 --> 05:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
um affording money
 
05:20:29.110 --> 05:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
and having a system be able to respond
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
to what we
 
05:20:33.430 --> 05:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
are looking at is a recall of
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
our emergency response it's just not a
 
05:20:36.548 --> 05:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
matter again
 
05:20:38.230 --> 05:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
of setting up a team you hire a couple
 
05:20:40.390 --> 05:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
of people and they go around with a
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
um with a van and say we're mobile
 
05:20:44.558 --> 05:20:45.910 align:start position:0%
um with a van and say we're mobile
response

05:20:45.910 --> 05:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
response
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have an rfp that was issued we're in
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
the process
 
05:20:54.070 --> 05:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
of getting that finalized
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
for a centralized dispatch center so to
 
05:20:58.320 --> 05:20:59.110 align:start position:0%
for a centralized dispatch center so to
speak

05:20:59.110 --> 05:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:21:02.470 --> 05:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
that can provide statewide
 
05:21:04.868 --> 05:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
coverage with one phone number instead
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
of the hundreds of phone numbers that we
 
05:21:08.310 --> 05:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
have out there when someone wants to
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
call their
 
05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
community mental health center or call
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
some some provider and find help
 
05:21:15.990 --> 05:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
they'll be one phone number for them to
 
05:21:16.000 --> 05:21:17.590 align:start position:0%
they'll be one phone number for them to
access

05:21:17.590 --> 05:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
access
 
05:21:21.270 --> 05:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
and determine on the this
 
05:21:24.390 --> 05:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
particular entity will be a hub so to
 
05:21:24.400 --> 05:21:25.110 align:start position:0%
particular entity will be a hub so to
speak

05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
and be able to dispatch
 
05:21:31.430 --> 05:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
in the community and do that screening
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
and assessment
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
initially so that we don't bring out the
 
05:21:37.350 --> 05:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
police if the police don't need to
 
05:21:37.360 --> 05:21:38.310 align:start position:0%
police if the police don't need to
intervene

05:21:38.310 --> 05:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
intervene
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
we don't um you know over burden a
 
05:21:41.600 --> 05:21:42.628 align:start position:0%
we don't um you know over burden a
system

05:21:42.628 --> 05:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:21:46.310 --> 05:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
we really determine um what that level
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
of need is
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
in that initial screening and then we
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
have the regional teams
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
that are able to respond based on what
 
05:21:56.150 --> 05:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
the need is so there may be
 
05:21:59.190 --> 05:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
resolution um through telephone and
 
05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
there may be resolution through that
 
05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
in person face to face so that
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
has um been our vision
 
05:22:09.910 --> 05:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what we want to see however
 
05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
we had a pandemic
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
and throughout that pandemic we did
 
05:22:16.868 --> 05:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
everything we could to
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
really hold together a system that was
 
05:22:19.120 --> 05:22:20.470 align:start position:0%
really hold together a system that was
fragile

05:22:20.470 --> 05:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
fragile
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
so we had workforce issues prior to the
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
pandemic we have
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
workforce issues today we have
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
readiness for our providers to be able
 
05:22:33.110 --> 05:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
to stand up these services
 
05:22:36.390 --> 05:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
and we also had the
 
05:22:39.030 --> 05:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
procurement process which was also
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
delayed because our contracts unit
 
05:22:43.910 --> 05:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
which i can't remember if you've had
 
05:22:45.910 --> 05:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
that presentation yet
 
05:22:48.548 --> 05:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
they were down staff they had a huge
 
05:22:48.558 --> 05:22:50.150 align:start position:0%
they were down staff they had a huge
vacancy

05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
vacancy
 
05:22:53.670 --> 05:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
level and um they had hundreds and
 
05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
hundreds of contracts to
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
execute for pandemic response
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
so all of those informational items that
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
you see on the governor on council
 
05:23:07.830 --> 05:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
agenda they were behind those in
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
for the department in getting those
 
05:23:11.990 --> 05:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
contracts in place so that we could get
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
all of the emergency services we needed
 
05:23:17.990 --> 05:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
to respond to the pandemic
 
05:23:21.990 --> 05:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
so it is not for a lack of
 
05:23:25.110 --> 05:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
money and it's not for lack of
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
hard work by erica and her team
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
and all of the people that we work with
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
was a matter of trying to transform a
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
system when we had an earthquake
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
and we're just trying to fill in those
 
05:23:37.920 --> 05:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
and we're just trying to fill in those
fissures

05:23:39.270 --> 05:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
fissures
 
05:23:42.788 --> 05:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
instead of um and really stabilize it
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we're still trying to stabilize it
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
we still have residential providers
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
who have um you know quarantine issues
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
they have bed space
 
05:23:53.350 --> 05:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
capacity issues they have staff that are
 
05:23:53.360 --> 05:23:54.070 align:start position:0%
capacity issues they have staff that are
out

05:23:54.070 --> 05:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:23:57.270 --> 05:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
um so i get pretty passionate about
 
05:23:59.590 --> 05:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're getting criticized
 
05:24:01.750 --> 05:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
um in many many fronts for not having
 
05:24:03.670 --> 05:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
this stood up yet but there are so many
 
05:24:03.680 --> 05:24:04.948 align:start position:0%
this stood up yet but there are so many
factors

05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
factors
 
05:24:08.070 --> 05:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
that go into that um and
 
05:24:10.628 --> 05:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
we are doing everything we can and we're
 
05:24:10.638 --> 05:24:11.270 align:start position:0%
we are doing everything we can and we're
still

05:24:11.270 --> 05:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
still
 
05:24:14.788 --> 05:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
on track to be able to go into contract
 
05:24:17.590 --> 05:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
and have this ready to go um in the next
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
several months
 
05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
could i ask one further question yes
 
05:24:26.310 --> 05:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
so could you so right now
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
did i understand you said we have three
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
that are operating and they've been
 
05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
operating for a while
 
05:24:37.030 --> 05:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many years but quite a
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
while right
 
05:24:41.030 --> 05:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes and you're and you're authorized to
 
05:24:43.830 --> 05:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
contract for two more
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
that right no no we're just to have
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
statewide mobile crisis
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's no number on that we just have
 
05:24:52.470 --> 05:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
to care
 
05:24:56.470 --> 05:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
have statewide coverage okay okay so
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
we're looking at transforming the system
 
05:25:01.270 --> 05:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
so when we think about it it's not
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
exactly the same model that we saw in
 
05:25:06.150 --> 05:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
manchester nashua and concord
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
a different approach to responding to
 
05:25:12.548 --> 05:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair any additional questions um
 
05:25:27.510 --> 05:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's i'm not seeing any and i have
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
trivia questions to ask you but i'll let
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
you continue
 
05:25:35.350 --> 05:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay i'll let that pass and keep moving
 
05:25:35.360 --> 05:25:36.708 align:start position:0%
okay i'll let that pass and keep moving
forward

05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:25:39.830 --> 05:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
so um this is really a slide about the
 
05:25:40.868 --> 05:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
it talks about the different levels of
 
05:25:43.910 --> 05:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
care which
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
is something that we're in the process
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
of implementing through
 
05:25:48.868 --> 05:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
our procurements we've had many
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
procurements um
 
05:25:53.830 --> 05:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
the result of taking this slide
 
05:25:57.430 --> 05:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
and operationalizing it and so
 
05:26:01.830 --> 05:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
when you look at um
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
kind of just pick one out in particular
 
05:26:08.230 --> 05:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
um so we've had a series of the
 
05:26:10.948 --> 05:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
initiatives that have been put in place
 
05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
this is some transformation that
 
05:26:13.120 --> 05:26:14.310 align:start position:0%
this is some transformation that
requires

05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
requires
 
05:26:17.190 --> 05:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
um building blocks you can't just start
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
anywhere and just start throwing it out
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
there and say oh this is the easiest
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
thing to do so let's go procure for that
 
05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
this really had building blocks so
 
05:26:25.040 --> 05:26:26.070 align:start position:0%
this really had building blocks so
hiring

05:26:26.070 --> 05:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
05:26:28.230 --> 05:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
erica's staff was a building block
 
05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
because we needed to have the
 
05:26:31.510 --> 05:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
wherewithal and the ability within the
 
05:26:31.520 --> 05:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
wherewithal and the ability within the
department

05:26:32.310 --> 05:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:26:35.270 --> 05:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
to move these initiatives forward and so
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
then we had
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
um we had coped and we
 
05:26:41.350 --> 05:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
needed to stand some things up pretty
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
quickly one was
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
on the care management entity for the
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
fast forward program
 
05:26:50.868 --> 05:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
and fast forward fast is
 
05:26:54.070 --> 05:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
families and systems together and it's a
 
05:26:54.080 --> 05:26:55.430 align:start position:0%
families and systems together and it's a
high

05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
high
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
fidelity wrap around model that's used
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
to address children's and families needs
 
05:27:07.510 --> 05:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and one of the major
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
levels of effort is the levels of care
 
05:27:10.480 --> 05:27:10.868 align:start position:0%
levels of effort is the levels of care
so

05:27:10.868 --> 05:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
there was the establishment and this was
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
done with hundreds of stakeholders who
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
participated in this process
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
and helped informed the levels of care
 
05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
for residential treatment we often
 
05:27:25.510 --> 05:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
find ourselves not having the level of
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
care that we need
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
in our state and so um individuals
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
have had to we've had to work with um
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
other states to find placements to get
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
the right level of care
 
05:27:41.670 --> 05:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
this um is a procurement that is
 
05:27:43.990 --> 05:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
currently out i believe it closes within
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
the next couple of weeks
 
05:27:48.708 --> 05:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
um and so we have um these
 
05:27:53.190 --> 05:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
levels that will then be able to provide
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
the right level of care at the right
 
05:27:55.200 --> 05:27:56.548 align:start position:0%
the right level of care at the right
time

05:27:56.548 --> 05:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:27:59.110 --> 05:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
and you had mentioned earlier i believe
 
05:28:02.070 --> 05:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
the children's level
 
05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
and what is needed this psychiatric
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
and hospitalization piece
 
05:28:16.150 --> 05:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
is the step down or step up
 
05:28:18.628 --> 05:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
um it's just below the level of care
 
05:28:20.230 --> 05:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about with
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
inpatient acute stays at
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
hempstead and now at new hampshire
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
hospital on a temporary basis
 
05:28:32.070 --> 05:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's a program that
 
05:28:34.230 --> 05:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
we've wanted to support for a number of
 
05:28:34.240 --> 05:28:35.110 align:start position:0%
we've wanted to support for a number of
years

05:28:35.110 --> 05:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:28:38.230 --> 05:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
and that also is subject to a
 
05:28:50.310 --> 05:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:52.948 --> 05:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
i think i'll pause here and let you read
 
05:28:55.030 --> 05:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
through and see if you have any specific
 
05:28:56.708 --> 05:28:56.718 align:start position:0%
questions because i think
 
05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of it has been addressed and this
 
05:29:22.708 --> 05:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.750 --> 05:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
like the workload measurements thank you
 
05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's nice to know how much work is
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:37.830 --> 05:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
so go ahead
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative wallner had a question i
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
think on that slide right there
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
so well i don't know that it's i don't
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
know that it's on this slide but this
 
05:29:49.430 --> 05:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
seems like a place where i might be able
 
05:29:49.440 --> 05:29:51.030 align:start position:0%
seems like a place where i might be able
to

05:29:51.030 --> 05:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
to ask this um
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
there was the suit that was brought
 
05:29:57.440 --> 05:29:57.990 align:start position:0%
there was the suit that was brought
against

05:29:57.990 --> 05:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:30:01.030 --> 05:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
the the department a few years ago the
 
05:30:02.310 --> 05:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
community mental health and then we had
 
05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
the community mental health agreement
 
05:30:09.270 --> 05:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
and on a fairly regular basis i don't
 
05:30:10.070 --> 05:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
know what it is
 
05:30:11.590 --> 05:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of times a year maybe a
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
quarterly it gets reviewed by the
 
05:30:17.430 --> 05:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
by an expert yes how are we how
 
05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
are we doing on it i mean i kind of
 
05:30:23.590 --> 05:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
kind of glimpsed at the most recent
 
05:30:23.600 --> 05:30:24.708 align:start position:0%
kind of glimpsed at the most recent
report

05:30:24.708 --> 05:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:30:27.430 --> 05:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it seemed like um we're still out of
 
05:30:29.350 --> 05:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
compliance in certain areas
 
05:30:31.830 --> 05:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
but i wondered if you could talk for a
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
minute about those areas and this might
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
not be the right slide i didn't know
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
where to put this in
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
so so um mr chair
 
05:30:43.350 --> 05:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
i would request that we hold that
 
05:30:45.270 --> 05:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
until we get to the bureau of mental
 
05:30:46.470 --> 05:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
health services
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
the bureau for mental health services
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
addresses the adult population
 
05:30:53.670 --> 05:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
which is the subject of the community
 
05:30:55.030 --> 05:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
mental health agreement
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
the committee mental health agreement
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
does not address children's services
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you yeah let's do
 
05:31:01.840 --> 05:31:02.230 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you yeah let's do
that

05:31:02.230 --> 05:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative walter is fine with that
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
yeah let's put that in the parking lot
 
05:31:08.718 --> 05:31:12.628 align:start position:0%
yeah let's put that in the parking lot
great

05:31:12.628 --> 05:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
data to provide to you and so this
 
05:31:25.190 --> 05:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
really shows um the number of children
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
that are being served by the committee
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
of the health centers um that just say
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
centers instead of services
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
um i believe but we've seen that growth
 
05:31:35.840 --> 05:31:36.230 align:start position:0%
um i believe but we've seen that growth
and

05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
i think that we have heard um from
 
05:31:38.878 --> 05:31:39.430 align:start position:0%
i think that we have heard um from
others

05:31:39.430 --> 05:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
others
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
previously about why we're seeing these
 
05:31:42.080 --> 05:31:45.190 align:start position:0%
previously about why we're seeing these
increases

05:31:45.190 --> 05:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious about this data within a
 
05:31:48.638 --> 05:31:49.350 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious about this data within a
different

05:31:49.350 --> 05:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:31:52.628 --> 05:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh assessment you know
 
05:31:56.230 --> 05:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
how many of these clients
 
05:31:59.990 --> 05:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just sort of curious about the
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
demographics here
 
05:32:06.868 --> 05:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
so i think that's something i just saw
 
05:32:08.310 --> 05:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
erica shake her head so i think that's
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
something we'll have to take back and
 
05:32:10.628 --> 05:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
see if we can
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
um bring back to you and do it
 
05:32:17.670 --> 05:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
by age cohorts actually i can answer
 
05:32:18.788 --> 05:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
that if you would like
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
and then and then i'd be curious about
 
05:32:25.190 --> 05:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
the complimentary slide that could go
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
with it which would be
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
who are we not servicing are there
 
05:32:30.000 --> 05:32:31.030 align:start position:0%
who are we not servicing are there
communities

05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:32:34.390 --> 05:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
that we should be uh addressing where
 
05:32:36.548 --> 05:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
we're just not doing a great job of
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
getting um
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:44.788 --> 05:32:44.798 align:start position:0%
so again um erica did she could address
 
05:32:46.230 --> 05:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
the 18 plus
 
05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
and i think she'd be happy to entertain
 
05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
me second question as well
 
05:32:54.548 --> 05:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely so this uh client count
 
05:32:54.558 --> 05:32:55.510 align:start position:0%
absolutely so this uh client count
actually

05:32:55.510 --> 05:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
does not include 18 to 21 year olds
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
those will be represented in julian
 
05:33:01.920 --> 05:33:02.628 align:start position:0%
those will be represented in julian
carbon's

05:33:02.628 --> 05:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
carbon's
 
05:33:06.070 --> 05:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh graphs for the adopt mental health
 
05:33:08.788 --> 05:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
side we are in the process of adjusting
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
our rules
 
05:33:12.868 --> 05:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
for the child eligibility to go
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
up to 21 but this is not represented
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
here yet
 
05:33:20.070 --> 05:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
i would say in that pain that is one
 
05:33:23.430 --> 05:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
area where we need to have some focused
 
05:33:23.440 --> 05:33:24.230 align:start position:0%
area where we need to have some focused
attention

05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
attention
 
05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
is engaging and that
 
05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
young adult transitional aged adult age
 
05:33:30.878 --> 05:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
young adult transitional aged adult age
group

05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
in uh more targeted engagement
 
05:33:37.910 --> 05:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
and more targeted services for that age
 
05:33:37.920 --> 05:33:39.510 align:start position:0%
and more targeted services for that age
group

05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:33:42.230 --> 05:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay so earlier one of the departments
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
said they considered
 
05:33:47.030 --> 05:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
essentially said not literally but
 
05:33:48.868 --> 05:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
essentially said that they considered
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
adulthood to begin at 18.
 
05:33:54.390 --> 05:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
so it's it's sounding a little bit like
 
05:33:55.030 --> 05:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
multiple divisions aiming at servicing
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
that 18 to 21 year
 
05:34:04.230 --> 05:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
age group and i just wonder if
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
if that's by design and if it's a smart
 
05:34:06.718 --> 05:34:07.990 align:start position:0%
if that's by design and if it's a smart
design

05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
design
 
05:34:10.310 --> 05:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
or if we are maybe making a mistake
 
05:34:11.350 --> 05:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
having two different
 
05:34:13.750 --> 05:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
divisions trying to take care of the
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
mental health of that
 
05:34:19.030 --> 05:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
age group so go ahead erica
 
05:34:21.990 --> 05:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that certainly when our
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
bureau is
 
05:34:26.310 --> 05:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh established we really wanted to align
 
05:34:29.750 --> 05:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
who we care for with
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
other entities such as schools who take
 
05:34:33.270 --> 05:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
care of
 
05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
and educate kids up to 21 if they have a
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
severe emotional disturbance and have
 
05:34:41.670 --> 05:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
an iep that requires them to be in
 
05:34:41.680 --> 05:34:42.070 align:start position:0%
an iep that requires them to be in
school

05:34:42.070 --> 05:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
till 21 so that we don't cause any sort
 
05:34:46.230 --> 05:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
of cliff effect
 
05:34:50.830 --> 05:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:50.840 --> 05:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
experience

05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:34:55.830 --> 05:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay so the the other part of that
 
05:34:56.708 --> 05:34:56.718 align:start position:0%
question and
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just something for the
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
department to talk about
 
05:35:03.670 --> 05:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
is just making sure that they uh
 
05:35:06.310 --> 05:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's clarity around who owns what
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
part of a mission for the 18 to 20 year
 
05:35:08.638 --> 05:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
part of a mission for the 18 to 20 year
olds

05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
olds
 
05:35:11.590 --> 05:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like there's more than
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
one bureau or more than one division
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
that does
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
so it just in my past it just seems like
 
05:35:18.240 --> 05:35:19.270 align:start position:0%
so it just in my past it just seems like
when

05:35:19.270 --> 05:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:35:21.430 --> 05:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
more than one group is responsible for
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
something it causes problems
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:31.990 --> 05:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
um so i would just say that yes there
 
05:35:34.150 --> 05:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
are multiple divisions that serve
 
05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
people who are 18 to 21 depending on
 
05:35:38.948 --> 05:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
their needs and what services they
 
05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
qualify for i think the
 
05:35:43.190 --> 05:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
the last presentation you heard about
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
was chris from chris santaniello
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and i think that there were different
 
05:35:48.240 --> 05:35:49.430 align:start position:0%
um and i think that there were different
eligibilities

05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
eligibilities
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
for programs that provide
 
05:35:56.628 --> 05:35:56.638 align:start position:0%
the provide payments potentially to
 
05:35:58.548 --> 05:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
people in that age group
 
05:36:00.390 --> 05:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think that behavioral health-wise
 
05:36:02.310 --> 05:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
erica has explained what's covered here
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
the other area that you will hear about
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
18 to 21 year olds
 
05:36:07.670 --> 05:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
would be over in developmental
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities um
 
05:36:11.350 --> 05:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
which i believe that presentation is
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
next week but i would say that as far as
 
05:36:13.600 --> 05:36:15.590 align:start position:0%
next week but i would say that as far as
coordination

05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
that i i from what i've seen coming from
 
05:36:19.110 --> 05:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
a different department the directors
 
05:36:19.120 --> 05:36:19.430 align:start position:0%
a different department the directors
here

05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:36:21.430 --> 05:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
coordinate very very well um between
 
05:36:23.030 --> 05:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
programs there's always more work to be
 
05:36:23.040 --> 05:36:23.670 align:start position:0%
programs there's always more work to be
done

05:36:23.670 --> 05:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:36:25.590 --> 05:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
but it certainly isn't siloed to the
 
05:36:26.708 --> 05:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
point that they don't know what the
 
05:36:28.470 --> 05:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
others are doing
 
05:36:30.548 --> 05:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
i think i think we heard that the path
 
05:36:30.558 --> 05:36:32.548 align:start position:0%
i think i think we heard that the path
center

05:36:32.548 --> 05:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
center
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
the youngest person could be was 18 to
 
05:36:35.910 --> 05:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
be over
 
05:36:39.990 --> 05:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
in that building for example so
 
05:36:47.350 --> 05:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.390 --> 05:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay so this um slide talks about um the
 
05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
eligibility category
 
05:36:54.548 --> 05:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
and um so there are different
 
05:36:54.558 --> 05:36:55.590 align:start position:0%
and um so there are different
eligibility

05:36:55.590 --> 05:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
05:36:58.948 --> 05:36:58.958 align:start position:0%
categories that we have um and this is
 
05:37:01.990 --> 05:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
um it shows all the trending is up
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and if there are specific questions
 
05:37:05.590 --> 05:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
about eligibility
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
um now would be the time to ask them and
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:37:11.190 --> 05:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
erica would be prepared to answer those
 
05:37:11.200 --> 05:37:14.150 align:start position:0%
erica would be prepared to answer those
questions

05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:18.390 --> 05:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
so cmhc that's community mental health
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:23.750 --> 05:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's a community mental
 
05:37:25.030 --> 05:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
health centers
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
and so the 10 centers that are
 
05:37:27.360 --> 05:37:28.310 align:start position:0%
and so the 10 centers that are
designated

05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
designated
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
across the state example on concord you
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
have river bend in manchester you have
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
manchester mental health
 
05:37:38.070 --> 05:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
you have sea coast mental health you
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
have northern human services in the
 
05:37:42.628 --> 05:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
north country etc
 
05:37:42.638 --> 05:37:46.230 align:start position:0%
north country etc
okay

05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
are there any questions here from any
 
05:37:48.718 --> 05:37:51.190 align:start position:0%
are there any questions here from any
anyone

05:37:51.190 --> 05:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
05:37:57.110 --> 05:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
so i think i mentioned before cme is
 
05:37:59.840 --> 05:38:00.310 align:start position:0%
so i think i mentioned before cme is
care

05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
management entity um that oversees the
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
um fast forward program and the
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
wraparound services
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the number of enrolled
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
has continued to increase and so this is
 
05:38:14.878 --> 05:38:15.190 align:start position:0%
has continued to increase and so this is
an

05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:38:18.230 --> 05:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
area of growth that we
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
have moved to having to two
 
05:38:23.750 --> 05:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
so you'll see this one and by the way
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm so proud of myself
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
nfi which you see here which is a
 
05:38:28.080 --> 05:38:28.788 align:start position:0%
nfi which you see here which is a
provider

05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
of housing services on campus as we
 
05:38:32.470 --> 05:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier
 
05:38:36.868 --> 05:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
um is north eastern family institute
 
05:38:40.948 --> 05:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
and so they are very similar to kfc
 
05:38:42.868 --> 05:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
they're never known as kentucky fried
 
05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
chicken they're always known
 
05:38:47.910 --> 05:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
by their acronym which is in this case
 
05:38:47.920 --> 05:38:49.510 align:start position:0%
by their acronym which is in this case
nfi

05:38:49.510 --> 05:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
nfi
 
05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
very good so that new hampshire hospital
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
can cross that off their list of things
 
05:38:56.390 --> 05:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
to get back to you
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
so we have to get back to them and tell
 
05:38:59.670 --> 05:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
them to put the e in there if they're
 
05:38:59.680 --> 05:39:00.788 align:start position:0%
them to put the e in there if they're
northeast

05:39:00.788 --> 05:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
northeast
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's right all right
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
um and so we um just got this
 
05:39:10.948 --> 05:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
in place in october which seems like
 
05:39:10.958 --> 05:39:11.990 align:start position:0%
in place in october which seems like
yesterday

05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
05:39:14.548 --> 05:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
um which is the second um care
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
management entity
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
because of the anticipated growth and
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
05:39:22.390 --> 05:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
that they're ramping up their services
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
the services they cover mostly the
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
monadnock region in the western part of
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:39:32.230 --> 05:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
while nfi covers statewide
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
um i do want to mention because this
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
impacts when you look at the staffing
 
05:39:46.390 --> 05:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
for the bureau is that we determine
 
05:39:55.830 --> 05:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:59.190 --> 05:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
so the key accomplishments
 
05:40:02.548 --> 05:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
erica did an amazing job of hiring in
 
05:40:05.190 --> 05:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
staff and onboarding them during the
 
05:40:05.200 --> 05:40:06.470 align:start position:0%
staff and onboarding them during the
pandemic

05:40:06.470 --> 05:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
so um as you can imagine that was
 
05:40:09.280 --> 05:40:09.910 align:start position:0%
so um as you can imagine that was
difficult

05:40:09.910 --> 05:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
05:40:13.030 --> 05:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
um but has been very successful it did
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
help that we were able to hire some
 
05:40:17.510 --> 05:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who already were working
 
05:40:19.270 --> 05:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
within the department and wanted to take
 
05:40:19.280 --> 05:40:20.470 align:start position:0%
within the department and wanted to take
on

05:40:20.470 --> 05:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
the new initiatives and the excitement
 
05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
so the 10-year mental health plan um
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
when we talk about that i think people
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
default to
 
05:40:37.190 --> 05:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
thinking that it addresses adults
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
because our previous plan
 
05:40:42.150 --> 05:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
that was established in 2008
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
only addressed adults and we were about
 
05:40:45.990 --> 05:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
and determined
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
that in this current mental health plan
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
that it would cover all populations
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
and put an emphasis on children
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay so i have to ask how would one
 
05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
assess an infant to determine if they
 
05:41:01.990 --> 05:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
have mental health
 
05:41:06.470 --> 05:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
issues that's a very good question erica
 
05:41:07.030 --> 05:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
would you
 
05:41:09.190 --> 05:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
um erica was very involved in the
 
05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
development of this mental health plan
 
05:41:13.350 --> 05:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
and i will say that we partnered with
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
other parts of the department
 
05:41:17.510 --> 05:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
and so henry littman our medicaid
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
director was also involved in the
 
05:41:21.190 --> 05:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
development of this plan
 
05:41:24.310 --> 05:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
through a initiative that was funded by
 
05:41:25.830 --> 05:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
i believe the national governors
 
05:41:27.990 --> 05:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
association that recognized this was an
 
05:41:31.350 --> 05:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
area that needed attention go ahead
 
05:41:31.360 --> 05:41:32.628 align:start position:0%
area that needed attention go ahead
erica

05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
erica
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
certainly that's a question that we get
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
asked a lot and it's a question i had
 
05:41:39.510 --> 05:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
a few years ago before i went to that
 
05:41:41.670 --> 05:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
training in minnesota
 
05:41:44.788 --> 05:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
so there is a diagnostic manual
 
05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
for infants and very young children
 
05:41:50.070 --> 05:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
that is a companion to the diagnostic
 
05:41:50.080 --> 05:41:51.190 align:start position:0%
that is a companion to the diagnostic
manual

05:41:51.190 --> 05:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
manual
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
clinicians use for diagnosing
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh older children and adults so there is
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
a companion
 
05:42:03.910 --> 05:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
piece there um and so most of it
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
centers around the infant and
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
any sort of growth development or
 
05:42:10.320 --> 05:42:12.310 align:start position:0%
any sort of growth development or
milestone

05:42:12.310 --> 05:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
milestone
 
05:42:15.430 --> 05:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
not being achieved and
 
05:42:18.868 --> 05:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
there's a focus on sort of
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
sleep feeding and crying
 
05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
issues um that may uh an
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
infant a parent of an infant may
 
05:42:26.958 --> 05:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
infant a parent of an infant may
experience

05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:42:30.470 --> 05:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then there's also an emphasis on the
 
05:42:31.670 --> 05:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
parent child
 
05:42:34.868 --> 05:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
bond so there are things when you're
 
05:42:34.878 --> 05:42:35.750 align:start position:0%
bond so there are things when you're
assessing

05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
05:42:38.788 --> 05:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
um i think everybody's fairly familiar
 
05:42:38.798 --> 05:42:39.110 align:start position:0%
um i think everybody's fairly familiar
with

05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
a developmental assessment of an infant
 
05:42:44.708 --> 05:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
if milestones aren't being reached
 
05:42:46.230 --> 05:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's definitely
 
05:42:48.788 --> 05:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
an area of concern and would need uh
 
05:42:51.030 --> 05:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
some medical rule out but also could be
 
05:42:52.948 --> 05:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
attributed to some behavioral health
 
05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
issues that can be addressed
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
um let's go to the next step
 
05:43:02.230 --> 05:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's say that that in fact
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
you can't assess the mental health of an
 
05:43:05.120 --> 05:43:06.390 align:start position:0%
you can't assess the mental health of an
infant

05:43:06.390 --> 05:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
infant
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
since most of our mental health
 
05:43:10.150 --> 05:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
treatment these days seems to be with
 
05:43:10.160 --> 05:43:11.190 align:start position:0%
treatment these days seems to be with
psychotropic

05:43:11.190 --> 05:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
psychotropic
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
interventions are we is
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
what are we doing if we assess infant
 
05:43:19.510 --> 05:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
with mental health issues are we
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
drugging them we're certainly not
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
counseling them we are not we're
 
05:43:26.150 --> 05:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
educating the parents
 
05:43:30.548 --> 05:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
and we are treating the parent-child
 
05:43:34.230 --> 05:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
bond most of our infant work
 
05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
is about uh the return and response with
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
between a caregiver and an infant so
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
that is what is emphasized in treatment
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
so a lot of focus on the parent and the
 
05:43:48.788 --> 05:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
parent education as well
 
05:43:52.628 --> 05:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
so doesn't that get um filtered through
 
05:43:55.030 --> 05:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
a bunch of different cultural lenses of
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
what a parent-child relationship ought
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
i mean there's not just one way to
 
05:44:02.868 --> 05:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
parent child
 
05:44:05.590 --> 05:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
there are multiple cultures so
 
05:44:05.600 --> 05:44:06.708 align:start position:0%
there are multiple cultures so
absolutely

05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:44:09.030 --> 05:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'm still having problems figuring out
 
05:44:09.040 --> 05:44:09.910 align:start position:0%
i'm still having problems figuring out
what

05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:44:12.310 --> 05:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
what we could do effectively in this
 
05:44:12.320 --> 05:44:13.750 align:start position:0%
what we could do effectively in this
area

05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
area
 
05:44:16.310 --> 05:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
correct so all of our services need to
 
05:44:16.320 --> 05:44:16.788 align:start position:0%
correct so all of our services need to
be

05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:44:20.070 --> 05:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh looking through the lens of cultural
 
05:44:20.080 --> 05:44:21.190 align:start position:0%
uh looking through the lens of cultural
competence

05:44:21.190 --> 05:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
competence
 
05:44:24.390 --> 05:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
um so if you are serving a family and a
 
05:44:24.400 --> 05:44:25.110 align:start position:0%
um so if you are serving a family and a
child

05:44:25.110 --> 05:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
that is experiencing issues that is from
 
05:44:29.910 --> 05:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
a different culture of yours you
 
05:44:32.788 --> 05:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
need really need to be you know
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
educating yourself
 
05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
on what those cultural standards are
 
05:44:39.510 --> 05:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
during that but it's really all about
 
05:44:39.520 --> 05:44:40.230 align:start position:0%
during that but it's really all about
focusing

05:44:40.230 --> 05:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
focusing
 
05:44:43.510 --> 05:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
on the issues that may bring a child
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
to a uh assessment of this
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
nature um you know or what is found
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
through a primary care will child check
 
05:44:54.470 --> 05:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
and those developmental
 
05:44:57.030 --> 05:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
milestones not being achieved so if
 
05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
everything else can be ruled out then we
 
05:44:59.910 --> 05:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
need to look
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
more closely on at the behavioral health
 
05:45:06.230 --> 05:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
the home environment and the parent
 
05:45:10.548 --> 05:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:14.310 --> 05:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
okay um so someday not in this budget
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
cycle i'd like to
 
05:45:17.830 --> 05:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
talk about how you measure effectiveness
 
05:45:20.070 --> 05:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
of a program like that i don't
 
05:45:22.868 --> 05:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you get your arm around
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
success metrics
 
05:45:27.990 --> 05:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
but anyways that's too much to be
 
05:45:29.270 --> 05:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
determined actually
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's part of our development that we
 
05:45:32.470 --> 05:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
have to determine what those
 
05:45:36.070 --> 05:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
metrics will look like okay great thank
 
05:45:36.080 --> 05:45:38.310 align:start position:0%
metrics will look like okay great thank
you

05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
so getting on to key challenges i think
 
05:45:40.798 --> 05:45:41.430 align:start position:0%
so getting on to key challenges i think
um

05:45:41.430 --> 05:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:43.350 --> 05:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
you're gonna start see seeing some
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
repeats here
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
um so workforce again
 
05:45:51.670 --> 05:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
system expansion is really hard to do
 
05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
when you're just holding on
 
05:46:00.310 --> 05:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:03.430 --> 05:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
the medicaid primary funder for the
 
05:46:03.440 --> 05:46:03.990 align:start position:0%
the medicaid primary funder for the
services

05:46:03.990 --> 05:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:46:06.150 --> 05:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
developed by children's behavioral
 
05:46:07.350 --> 05:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
health and
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
so we use state general funds to fill in
 
05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
the gaps
 
05:46:14.470 --> 05:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
when we cannot bill medicaid
 
05:46:17.830 --> 05:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
um and so we've seen children enter the
 
05:46:17.840 --> 05:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
um and so we've seen children enter the
system

05:46:18.470 --> 05:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic that have never
 
05:46:22.708 --> 05:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
ever entered the system before
 
05:46:24.150 --> 05:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
so some of those children are
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
commercially insured
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and some of them are um have are in
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
families that aren't too short
 
05:46:33.510 --> 05:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
insured and but really working we've
 
05:46:34.948 --> 05:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
been working with the legislature
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
actually on this commercial insurance
 
05:46:36.958 --> 05:46:37.590 align:start position:0%
actually on this commercial insurance
side

05:46:37.590 --> 05:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
side
 
05:46:40.628 --> 05:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
because medicaid will pay for services
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
um that we've built up over time
 
05:46:46.390 --> 05:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
that commercial insurance has yet to
 
05:46:47.590 --> 05:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
catch up to
 
05:46:50.390 --> 05:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
so we need to make sure that we're
 
05:46:52.708 --> 05:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
addressing all children's needs
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
rather than just those who are on
 
05:46:56.000 --> 05:46:59.750 align:start position:0%
rather than just those who are on
medicaid

05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
and then again looking at the staffing
 
05:47:02.718 --> 05:47:03.350 align:start position:0%
and then again looking at the staffing
um

05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:06.470 --> 05:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
in transformation of the system and
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
overseeing the network throughout the
 
05:47:09.360 --> 05:47:10.548 align:start position:0%
overseeing the network throughout the
pandemic

05:47:10.548 --> 05:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with the department
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
of education
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
in overseeing the system of care because
 
05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
05:47:21.750 --> 05:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
statute that addresses both departments
 
05:47:22.628 --> 05:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
working together
 
05:47:25.830 --> 05:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
knowing how critical it is with
 
05:47:34.150 --> 05:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:37.830 --> 05:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i think i hope karen is here
 
05:47:40.948 --> 05:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
um but she may or may not be but jane
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
should be there's karen oh i'm here i'm
 
05:47:45.030 --> 05:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
here i'm multitasking sorry
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um so the charts here
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is similar to the other part chart
 
05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
with 20
 
05:47:56.470 --> 05:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
20 and 2021 and representative walner
 
05:47:56.480 --> 05:47:56.868 align:start position:0%
20 and 2021 and representative walner
was

05:47:56.868 --> 05:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:47:59.670 --> 05:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
referencing this earlier that if the
 
05:47:59.680 --> 05:48:00.310 align:start position:0%
referencing this earlier that if the
funds

05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:48:03.430 --> 05:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
had been contracted um in a
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
more timely way in 2020 the general
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
funds would look very similar
 
05:48:09.910 --> 05:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
in that middle pie chart compared to the
 
05:48:11.990 --> 05:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
pie chart on the right
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
the new other funds coming in there
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
are a grant that doe has received
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
that they are working with us on
 
05:48:24.310 --> 05:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
so that's what those funds coming up uh
 
05:48:24.320 --> 05:48:24.948 align:start position:0%
so that's what those funds coming up uh
in

05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:48:31.670 --> 05:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:33.430 --> 05:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
i i was just going to say the the large
 
05:48:35.030 --> 05:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
increase in general funds which i know
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
katya has spoken about
 
05:48:38.948 --> 05:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
is really bringing that children's
 
05:48:40.948 --> 05:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
system of care together and
 
05:48:45.350 --> 05:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
bringing those contracts in place
 
05:48:48.470 --> 05:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
all which will help
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
dcyf quite a bit in the future
 
05:48:54.788 --> 05:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of children um
 
05:48:58.070 --> 05:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want to i don't want to sound
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
mean but
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
i i probably can't help it here
 
05:49:06.868 --> 05:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
how do we know i mean it's we have a
 
05:49:08.548 --> 05:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
theory that
 
05:49:10.708 --> 05:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
early intervention even at the infant
 
05:49:11.830 --> 05:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
level is going to
 
05:49:15.190 --> 05:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
result in some some successes
 
05:49:16.948 --> 05:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any way to measure it
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
so we don't actually
 
05:49:20.470 --> 05:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
know whether or not this is a valid
 
05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
theory at this point
 
05:49:24.150 --> 05:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
so how do we how do we say money
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
invested now
 
05:49:29.350 --> 05:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
is is we're sure is going to positively
 
05:49:31.910 --> 05:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
influence the dcyf community in the
 
05:49:31.920 --> 05:49:32.470 align:start position:0%
influence the dcyf community in the
future

05:49:32.470 --> 05:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:49:36.150 --> 05:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm missing something there
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure katya will jump in there but
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
i would also just suggest that you also
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
ask that question of joe ripsom because
 
05:49:43.750 --> 05:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
this is a system that they stood up in
 
05:49:46.150 --> 05:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
new jersey where he worked previously
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
um so he has some lived experience with
 
05:49:50.548 --> 05:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
it as well
 
05:49:52.628 --> 05:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
okay all right go ahead katya yeah and
 
05:49:54.150 --> 05:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'll just quickly mention that
 
05:49:56.310 --> 05:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices that have been
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
proven to be effective
 
05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
are um what we're employing so
 
05:50:04.150 --> 05:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
when we implement something we look at
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
first to see if it's an
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice or a promising
 
05:50:08.240 --> 05:50:09.270 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice or a promising
practice

05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
practice
 
05:50:11.030 --> 05:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
that has been tested and studied and
 
05:50:11.040 --> 05:50:12.470 align:start position:0%
that has been tested and studied and
researched

05:50:12.470 --> 05:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
researched
 
05:50:15.670 --> 05:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
in implementing that to really get at
 
05:50:15.680 --> 05:50:15.990 align:start position:0%
in implementing that to really get at
those

05:50:15.990 --> 05:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes that you're talking about and
 
05:50:19.110 --> 05:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to be measuring this it's
 
05:50:21.030 --> 05:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
not like we're just going to
 
05:50:24.868 --> 05:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
spend money and have no accountability
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:50:27.030 --> 05:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be measuring it as we
 
05:50:29.750 --> 05:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
go along i did want to point out
 
05:50:31.750 --> 05:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
something that you'll see i believe it's
 
05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
a class note
 
05:50:36.390 --> 05:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
um in hb1 this
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health has been
 
05:50:40.788 --> 05:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
one area in this division
 
05:50:43.910 --> 05:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
which has not had non-lapsing language
 
05:50:43.920 --> 05:50:44.948 align:start position:0%
which has not had non-lapsing language
between

05:50:44.948 --> 05:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:50:47.910 --> 05:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
the two years that make up the biennium
 
05:50:49.270 --> 05:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
so we did have
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
funds i know there's been concerns that
 
05:50:53.910 --> 05:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
have been raised about lapse funds for
 
05:50:56.070 --> 05:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health
 
05:50:58.470 --> 05:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
those funds would not have labs if we
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
had had that language that allowed us to
 
05:51:01.750 --> 05:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
carry the
 
05:51:05.190 --> 05:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
funding um from 20 to 21.
 
05:51:08.310 --> 05:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
and so um again that was
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
something that we needed to put in and
 
05:51:12.390 --> 05:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's in there and
 
05:51:16.150 --> 05:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
we're also working with a legislature
 
05:51:19.510 --> 05:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
on some on a bill that
 
05:51:23.190 --> 05:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
would not allow the funds to lapse at
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
the end of the biennium but to carry
 
05:51:26.230 --> 05:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
forward the funds
 
05:51:28.230 --> 05:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
so that they remain committed to this
 
05:51:28.240 --> 05:51:29.670 align:start position:0%
so that they remain committed to this
effort

05:51:29.670 --> 05:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
effort
 
05:51:35.990 --> 05:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:38.830 --> 05:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
lots of questions here representative
 
05:51:38.840 --> 05:51:40.070 align:start position:0%
lots of questions here representative
wallner

05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
wallner
 
05:51:43.830 --> 05:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to know whether or not
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
they depart whether or not the
 
05:51:49.590 --> 05:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health area
 
05:51:49.600 --> 05:51:50.310 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health area
received

05:51:50.310 --> 05:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
received
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
all the funding that they requested
 
05:51:55.510 --> 05:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
and what what were the pre did you have
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
anything on your priority list that you
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.670 --> 05:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
so and unless somebody jumped up and
 
05:52:05.670 --> 05:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
down we did receive all the funding that
 
05:52:07.910 --> 05:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
was requested to stand to continue these
 
05:52:07.920 --> 05:52:09.110 align:start position:0%
was requested to stand to continue these
services

05:52:09.110 --> 05:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:52:12.788 --> 05:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
and um there were no prioritized needs
 
05:52:15.350 --> 05:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
um because they were everything was um
 
05:52:15.360 --> 05:52:15.910 align:start position:0%
um because they were everything was um
already

05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:52:21.110 --> 05:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
no that's what i wanted to know thank
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:29.670 --> 05:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair the way i see this
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
going is we won't rest until we have 100
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
percent of the children
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
having an annual psychiatric exam as
 
05:52:36.788 --> 05:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
well as an annual
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
physical i mean it's it's just there's
 
05:52:40.390 --> 05:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
lots of things that i've
 
05:52:42.868 --> 05:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
witnessed in myself and my children
 
05:52:44.470 --> 05:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
growing up and my grandchildren they
 
05:52:44.480 --> 05:52:45.510 align:start position:0%
growing up and my grandchildren they
have

05:52:45.510 --> 05:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know dream worlds they live in for a
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
while and they grow up and you know
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
some of these things were so deep that
 
05:52:53.280 --> 05:52:54.150 align:start position:0%
some of these things were so deep that
uh

05:52:54.150 --> 05:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:52:57.350 --> 05:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
one grandson could only be referred to
 
05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
as batman he wouldn't answer to his own
 
05:52:59.280 --> 05:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
as batman he wouldn't answer to his own
name

05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
name
 
05:53:03.270 --> 05:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
for a matter of months but i mean
 
05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing we we suddenly called
 
05:53:06.948 --> 05:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
in mental health people and i don't you
 
05:53:06.958 --> 05:53:07.430 align:start position:0%
in mental health people and i don't you
know

05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:53:10.150 --> 05:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
he outgrew it in six or eight months so
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
some of these things i think are
 
05:53:11.280 --> 05:53:12.708 align:start position:0%
some of these things i think are
overreacting

05:53:12.708 --> 05:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
overreacting
 
05:53:15.830 --> 05:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
and this growing a bigger and bigger
 
05:53:18.070 --> 05:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of the children
 
05:53:19.990 --> 05:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
who are likely just going through normal
 
05:53:22.628 --> 05:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
phases of growth
 
05:53:24.150 --> 05:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense that this is
 
05:53:25.750 --> 05:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
growing this much
 
05:53:27.190 --> 05:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have this bigger
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
problem in our society
 
05:53:34.470 --> 05:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
so could i suggest a possible way to
 
05:53:37.200 --> 05:53:37.750 align:start position:0%
so could i suggest a possible way to
address

05:53:37.750 --> 05:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:53:41.110 --> 05:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative weiler's comment and and
 
05:53:44.470 --> 05:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
it sort of uh would feed my issue too
 
05:53:46.628 --> 05:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
and that is you say we're using
 
05:53:46.638 --> 05:53:47.670 align:start position:0%
and that is you say we're using
evidence-based

05:53:47.670 --> 05:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
05:53:51.110 --> 05:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
models it would be nice to get kind of a
 
05:53:51.120 --> 05:53:52.150 align:start position:0%
models it would be nice to get kind of a
summary

05:53:52.150 --> 05:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
summary
 
05:53:55.270 --> 05:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing you know what what
 
05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
what evidence are we looking at
 
05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
what is is that within this budget cycle
 
05:54:04.708 --> 05:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
i i don't know maybe it has to be um
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
but but at this point we have a lot of
 
05:54:11.030 --> 05:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
programs that we know
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
are addressing real
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
medical needs that need to be funded
 
05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.670 --> 05:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
so this gets to the five percent um
 
05:54:31.510 --> 05:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
up and down um and so you can see where
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
we would expand
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
um we talked about the infant mental
 
05:54:36.548 --> 05:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
health we've talked about the care
 
05:54:39.190 --> 05:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
management entity and their capacity
 
05:54:42.070 --> 05:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
you saw the growth in that um and the
 
05:54:44.230 --> 05:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
increased demand for those services
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
erica told us i forget how many
 
05:54:50.470 --> 05:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
applications they're getting a day for
 
05:54:53.110 --> 05:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
individuals seeking those particular
 
05:54:53.120 --> 05:54:54.390 align:start position:0%
individuals seeking those particular
services

05:54:54.390 --> 05:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:54:57.030 --> 05:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then we would look at enhancing
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
communities treatment options
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
to therapeutic day treatment and
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
intensive outpatient treatment
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
i will say just um to go back to the
 
05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
previous slide where we see the huge
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
jump in general funds
 
05:55:12.708 --> 05:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
we are working on a couple of
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
initiatives that would allow us to
 
05:55:18.868 --> 05:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
match those funds with medicaid and so
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
while some services
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
aren't currently covered by medicaid
 
05:55:23.430 --> 05:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that
 
05:55:27.670 --> 05:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
we can use that as a tool and a resource
 
05:55:30.230 --> 05:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to garner that 50 percent
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
on some of those funds so the
 
05:55:36.628 --> 05:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
decrease we would have wait lists for
 
05:55:36.638 --> 05:55:37.190 align:start position:0%
decrease we would have wait lists for
those

05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:55:40.548 --> 05:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
high fidelity wrap around services
 
05:55:42.548 --> 05:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to move forward
 
05:55:43.990 --> 05:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
with the mental health
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
plan for infants and would only be able
 
05:55:47.520 --> 05:55:48.070 align:start position:0%
plan for infants and would only be able
to

05:55:48.070 --> 05:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
do it on a pilot basis or a very
 
05:55:52.470 --> 05:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
targeted basis
 
05:55:55.350 --> 05:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
and we would not be able to support
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
those children who aren't currently
 
05:55:57.120 --> 05:55:58.310 align:start position:0%
those children who aren't currently
covered

05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
covered
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:04.948 --> 05:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
there's the nine step that we've talked
 
05:56:04.958 --> 05:56:07.030 align:start position:0%
there's the nine step that we've talked
about

05:56:07.030 --> 05:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
and benchmarks
 
05:56:13.350 --> 05:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
um so again fast forward program we have
 
05:56:14.230 --> 05:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
been able to
 
05:56:16.948 --> 05:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
keep up we're worried about keeping up
 
05:56:19.270 --> 05:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
but we have been able to do that with
 
05:56:21.990 --> 05:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
additional staffing resources that were
 
05:56:22.000 --> 05:56:24.868 align:start position:0%
additional staffing resources that were
provided

05:56:24.868 --> 05:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:28.868 --> 05:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
the quality assurance reviews
 
05:56:31.910 --> 05:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
are really important
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then the assistance and con
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
consultation for the children's
 
05:56:40.150 --> 05:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
behavioral health programming
 
05:56:43.110 --> 05:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't tell you um the demand
 
05:56:44.708 --> 05:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
on erica's time and
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
for her staff they are constantly
 
05:56:48.240 --> 05:56:49.510 align:start position:0%
for her staff they are constantly
bombarded

05:56:49.510 --> 05:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
bombarded
 
05:56:52.070 --> 05:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
um with requests to provide that
 
05:56:53.190 --> 05:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
technical assistance
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
and to present um information about
 
05:56:58.548 --> 05:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health
 
05:57:01.270 --> 05:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and so that's across the board within
 
05:57:01.280 --> 05:57:01.990 align:start position:0%
um and so that's across the board within
internal

05:57:01.990 --> 05:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
internal
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:10.150 --> 05:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:13.270 --> 05:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
all right and then i'm going to turn it
 
05:57:17.830 --> 05:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
over to karen
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to stop screen sharing i'll
 
05:57:22.230 --> 05:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry
 
05:57:24.150 --> 05:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'll try not to do a bunch of other
 
05:57:27.030 --> 05:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
things at the same time
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:35.430 --> 05:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we're gonna start on page one
 
05:57:36.070 --> 05:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
one one
 
05:57:39.110 --> 05:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
eight which um
 
05:57:40.868 --> 05:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
has only the title of this accounting
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
unit so i'm gonna go ahead and go to
 
05:57:43.990 --> 05:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
page one one one nine
 
05:57:47.110 --> 05:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
which is accounting unit 2052 children's
 
05:57:59.430 --> 05:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
05:58:02.548 --> 05:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
and this has further accounts associated
 
05:58:04.230 --> 05:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
with it right
 
05:58:07.430 --> 05:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes this is uh really like the other
 
05:58:10.830 --> 05:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
area is the administrative part of the
 
05:58:10.840 --> 05:58:15.190 align:start position:0%
area is the administrative part of the
bureau

05:58:15.190 --> 05:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
so i can go ahead and go down to the
 
05:58:18.670 --> 05:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
next one which is
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
2053 which is the system of care the
 
05:58:33.110 --> 05:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:37.270 --> 05:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
so in 20 we were spending
 
05:58:40.868 --> 05:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
about 1.8 million and we're proposing in
 
05:58:46.150 --> 05:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:49.590 --> 05:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
are those are those all general funds
 
05:58:52.948 --> 05:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
for the most part there
 
05:58:56.310 --> 05:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
is about 750 000 of federal funds
 
05:58:58.230 --> 05:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
um and a little bit of other funds which
 
05:58:59.350 --> 05:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
is that grant
 
05:59:03.430 --> 05:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
from the department of education yeah
 
05:59:05.830 --> 05:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you based on what i know
 
05:59:07.670 --> 05:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
of and have seen for contracting
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
activity in this area
 
05:59:12.470 --> 05:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
um this year i i do believe that we will
 
05:59:16.628 --> 05:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
spend most of those funds in 22 and 23.
 
05:59:22.948 --> 05:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
very good any questions here
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
you need another moment to look at it
 
05:59:26.310 --> 05:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
represent walnut
 
05:59:29.670 --> 05:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
weiler bean i just think it's
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
unsustainable growth we don't have the
 
05:59:34.708 --> 05:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
revenue coming in to support this kind
 
05:59:35.590 --> 05:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
of growth
 
05:59:40.230 --> 05:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:45.910 --> 05:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:47.350 --> 05:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
where does this department think the
 
05:59:53.030 --> 05:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:55.590 --> 05:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
45 in general funds and so many of these
 
05:59:55.600 --> 05:59:56.868 align:start position:0%
45 in general funds and so many of these
things

05:59:56.868 --> 05:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:59:58.230 --> 05:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have that kind of revenue we
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the kind of revenue sources
 
06:00:04.868 --> 06:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
these are just not going to work so
 
06:00:08.628 --> 06:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
so what what if you were to um
 
06:00:11.990 --> 06:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
look out to the next biennium is this
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
or is this uh kind of this uh
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
geometric progression going to continue
 
06:00:18.400 --> 06:00:18.948 align:start position:0%
geometric progression going to continue
next

06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
next
 
06:00:22.310 --> 06:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
katya do you have any insight or erica i
 
06:00:26.948 --> 06:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
i would not anticipate that it would
 
06:00:26.958 --> 06:00:27.510 align:start position:0%
i would not anticipate that it would
grow

06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
grow
 
06:00:30.390 --> 06:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
at this um we had a system that wasn't a
 
06:00:30.400 --> 06:00:31.270 align:start position:0%
at this um we had a system that wasn't a
system

06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:00:33.350 --> 06:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're building a system to address the
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
needs of children
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
and to get to the point of how do we
 
06:00:38.788 --> 06:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
06:00:41.510 --> 06:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
cost avoidance i think we look at
 
06:00:42.390 --> 06:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
division two
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
and our division three one whichever one
 
06:00:47.830 --> 06:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
and look at the cost in safety and look
 
06:00:49.750 --> 06:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
at the costs in our criminal justice
 
06:00:49.760 --> 06:00:50.788 align:start position:0%
at the costs in our criminal justice
system

06:00:50.788 --> 06:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:00:53.990 --> 06:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so um if we get this system
 
06:00:56.548 --> 06:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
in place we're going to have the
 
06:00:56.558 --> 06:00:57.430 align:start position:0%
in place we're going to have the
services

06:00:57.430 --> 06:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:00:59.830 --> 06:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
and the supports that are needed for
 
06:00:59.840 --> 06:01:00.470 align:start position:0%
and the supports that are needed for
families

06:01:00.470 --> 06:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
families
 
06:01:03.750 --> 06:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
and children that will really have a
 
06:01:03.760 --> 06:01:04.548 align:start position:0%
and children that will really have a
significant

06:01:04.548 --> 06:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
significant
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
impact on families in the future and
 
06:01:09.990 --> 06:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
where they end up in the trajectory
 
06:01:12.948 --> 06:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
of children we always think in two-year
 
06:01:12.958 --> 06:01:13.750 align:start position:0%
of children we always think in two-year
terms

06:01:13.750 --> 06:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
terms
 
06:01:16.230 --> 06:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
but we really when we're building a
 
06:01:17.910 --> 06:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
system like this we're looking
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:25.830 --> 06:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative yes um
 
06:01:30.310 --> 06:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
erica and katja i i'm wondering um
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
what's what do what do people talk about
 
06:01:36.868 --> 06:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
at the federal level about um
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
a children's system of care and um
 
06:01:41.990 --> 06:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
do you see a future there that the
 
06:01:43.590 --> 06:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
federal government would get more
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
involved in these kinds of these kinds
 
06:01:49.270 --> 06:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
of programs because like katy just said
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
it prevents large expenses
 
06:01:55.350 --> 06:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
in other areas but it's going to take us
 
06:01:56.310 --> 06:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
a while
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
to really build a system and really get
 
06:02:00.470 --> 06:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
to the point where
 
06:02:03.910 --> 06:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're saving those funds in other areas
 
06:02:05.510 --> 06:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
so what do you think the future for the
 
06:02:05.520 --> 06:02:08.390 align:start position:0%
so what do you think the future for the
federal

06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:12.470 --> 06:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:18.390 --> 06:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
so i think we'll see more federal
 
06:02:20.470 --> 06:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
participation for this we have
 
06:02:23.110 --> 06:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
availed ourselves of many different
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
iterations of system of care grants
 
06:02:29.350 --> 06:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
we have seen through our work with the
 
06:02:29.360 --> 06:02:30.230 align:start position:0%
we have seen through our work with the
medicaid

06:02:30.230 --> 06:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
06:02:33.190 --> 06:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
federal medicaid office and building our
 
06:02:35.430 --> 06:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid benefit for the fast forward
 
06:02:35.440 --> 06:02:36.150 align:start position:0%
medicaid benefit for the fast forward
program

06:02:36.150 --> 06:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
we're seeing their sort of hearts and
 
06:02:40.868 --> 06:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
minds open a bit wider
 
06:02:44.708 --> 06:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
around what uh needs to be invested in
 
06:02:48.150 --> 06:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
by medicaid by the federal participation
 
06:02:50.868 --> 06:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
for kids and families and not just
 
06:02:51.990 --> 06:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
having a narrow
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
view of what um they would pay for so
 
06:02:56.628 --> 06:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
them uh broaden their perspective on
 
06:03:01.270 --> 06:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
what is necessary
 
06:03:03.430 --> 06:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
to support these children families with
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
severe emotional disturbances
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
so i think you'll see in the future more
 
06:03:11.590 --> 06:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
federal participation
 
06:03:14.470 --> 06:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
than we've seen there is a huge push to
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
develop system of care
 
06:03:18.628 --> 06:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
and again we've had about four different
 
06:03:20.868 --> 06:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
system of care grants for new hampshire
 
06:03:23.510 --> 06:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
to build upon what we've developed over
 
06:03:23.520 --> 06:03:24.628 align:start position:0%
to build upon what we've developed over
time

06:03:24.628 --> 06:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
i think you'll see more uh broader sort
 
06:03:30.868 --> 06:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
of assistance there
 
06:03:35.590 --> 06:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you have a follow-up
 
06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh no not right now thank you okay
 
06:03:42.548 --> 06:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh anytime so um
 
06:03:46.390 --> 06:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
who which state or states
 
06:03:49.350 --> 06:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
are furthest ahead with implementing a
 
06:03:50.390 --> 06:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
06:03:53.670 --> 06:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
model and do they have demonstrable
 
06:03:53.680 --> 06:03:54.628 align:start position:0%
model and do they have demonstrable
results

06:03:54.628 --> 06:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
results
 
06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
to show that some of the
 
06:04:01.110 --> 06:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
assumed benefits and the out years
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:07.830 --> 06:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
erica says i know that we do have states
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
that we look to
 
06:04:12.310 --> 06:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
and this will be another question
 
06:04:15.830 --> 06:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
that will be really important for dcyf
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
director joe whitson to address it based
 
06:04:20.310 --> 06:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
on his experience in new jersey
 
06:04:23.910 --> 06:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead so our key partners
 
06:04:25.430 --> 06:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of our system of care
 
06:04:29.350 --> 06:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:32.788 --> 06:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
wisconsin uh wraparound milwaukee was
 
06:04:34.230 --> 06:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
our training partner they
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
trained us in uh system of care and high
 
06:04:39.110 --> 06:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
fidelity wraparound
 
06:04:42.628 --> 06:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
um and they have seen demonstral
 
06:04:45.670 --> 06:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh returns on investments in the areas
 
06:04:45.680 --> 06:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
uh returns on investments in the areas
of

06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:04:50.310 --> 06:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
children in dcyf either cps
 
06:04:53.430 --> 06:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
or juvenile justice and a reduction in
 
06:04:55.510 --> 06:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
acute hospitalizations for
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
folks with psychiatric concerns so
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
there's a real return on investment
 
06:05:02.628 --> 06:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
there that is seen nationally and not
 
06:05:04.628 --> 06:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
just in wisconsin
 
06:05:06.708 --> 06:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
and we've also most recently because of
 
06:05:06.718 --> 06:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
and we've also most recently because of
our

06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:05:11.430 --> 06:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
relationship with joe ribson now we have
 
06:05:11.440 --> 06:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
relationship with joe ribson now we have
partnered

06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
partnered
 
06:05:14.150 --> 06:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
with new jersey who has really turned
 
06:05:15.590 --> 06:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
their system around
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
in in terms of right-sizing uh
 
06:05:21.270 --> 06:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health and and
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
their child protection
 
06:05:26.310 --> 06:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
system so he has lots to offer
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of information his experience
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
in that system
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
and how he and i are working very
 
06:05:34.230 --> 06:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
closely to
 
06:05:37.270 --> 06:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
emulate that system we took a number of
 
06:05:37.280 --> 06:05:38.470 align:start position:0%
emulate that system we took a number of
legislators

06:05:38.470 --> 06:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
06:05:41.350 --> 06:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
down to new jersey so that they could
 
06:05:42.310 --> 06:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
hear from
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
folks there um and he they had the
 
06:05:48.070 --> 06:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
same uh experiences wrap around
 
06:05:49.110 --> 06:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
milwaukee is
 
06:05:51.990 --> 06:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
a real decrease in those court involved
 
06:05:54.628 --> 06:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
kids either through cps or jj
 
06:05:56.708 --> 06:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
and those receiving the right behavioral
 
06:05:59.350 --> 06:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
health service at the right time
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
if i can just add in there too from the
 
06:06:02.708 --> 06:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
previous presentation with new hampshire
 
06:06:04.230 --> 06:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
hospital chair you had
 
06:06:06.788 --> 06:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
brought up how do we serve more kids in
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
the community
 
06:06:09.750 --> 06:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
and this is the system that serves those
 
06:06:10.868 --> 06:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
kids in the community
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
this is what will bring down that wait
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
list which will
 
06:06:17.830 --> 06:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know like the ceo of the hospital
 
06:06:19.270 --> 06:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are always children who
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
will need
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
the hospitalization services but for
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
those that we can reach earlier
 
06:06:25.990 --> 06:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
these this is the system that will do
 
06:06:26.000 --> 06:06:28.788 align:start position:0%
these this is the system that will do
that

06:06:28.788 --> 06:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to think i'll get to you
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative wallner in just a
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
second just
 
06:06:37.350 --> 06:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
so in terms of demonstrating results i
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
kind of look at an
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
evolution of knowledge to go from
 
06:06:44.230 --> 06:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
good theory good anecdotal information
 
06:06:45.990 --> 06:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
experience based
 
06:06:49.350 --> 06:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
to academic peer-reviewed
 
06:06:52.868 --> 06:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
studies uh showing uh cost-benefit
 
06:06:52.878 --> 06:06:54.150 align:start position:0%
studies uh showing uh cost-benefit
analysis

06:06:54.150 --> 06:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
06:06:57.030 --> 06:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
to something that's even subjected to a
 
06:06:58.868 --> 06:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
performance audit to where
 
06:07:01.670 --> 06:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
results are are are tested by
 
06:07:02.788 --> 06:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
consultants and
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
and and demonstrated to be uh
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
tangible so where where do you think
 
06:07:12.628 --> 06:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
say new jersey or wisconsin is
 
06:07:15.830 --> 06:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
and that sort of evolution of knowledge
 
06:07:20.948 --> 06:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i would say wisconsin is about 20
 
06:07:24.708 --> 06:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
some odd years
 
06:07:28.470 --> 06:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
into their system evolution
 
06:07:31.510 --> 06:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
new jersey is probably midway
 
06:07:34.390 --> 06:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
in that evolution they're around 10 12
 
06:07:34.400 --> 06:07:34.948 align:start position:0%
in that evolution they're around 10 12
years

06:07:34.948 --> 06:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:07:42.628 --> 06:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:44.708 --> 06:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
okay so my question was more
 
06:07:46.868 --> 06:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
specifically how have they documented
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
their results
 
06:07:51.510 --> 06:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
can can wisconsin give us something
 
06:07:53.670 --> 06:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
that we could read and touch and look at
 
06:07:54.708 --> 06:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
what what their
 
06:07:57.910 --> 06:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
actual results are yes and actually
 
06:07:59.990 --> 06:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
system of care is well documented
 
06:08:01.910 --> 06:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
nationally as to what those return on
 
06:08:04.150 --> 06:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
investments and outcomes ought to be
 
06:08:06.310 --> 06:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
and we are on par with those and we can
 
06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
certainly share the
 
06:08:12.070 --> 06:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
national outcome uh literature with them
 
06:08:14.788 --> 06:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
okay so i think based on where we're at
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
with the
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
status of our revenues come going into
 
06:08:19.350 --> 06:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
the next two years
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
we really need to see something
 
06:08:26.310 --> 06:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
that gives us confidence that this is
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
this is money well invested i'm not
 
06:08:29.350 --> 06:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
saying it
 
06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
isn't it's just new and
 
06:08:35.110 --> 06:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's just relatively a lot of money real
 
06:08:37.110 --> 06:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
to compared to what we have to look for
 
06:08:40.868 --> 06:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
so um so if you could help us help you
 
06:08:42.230 --> 06:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
that would be great representative
 
06:08:42.240 --> 06:08:44.070 align:start position:0%
that would be great representative
wallner

06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
wallner
 
06:08:47.110 --> 06:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh hi i am
 
06:08:50.948 --> 06:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
in 2020 we were only spending
 
06:08:55.510 --> 06:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
and we were spending less than two
 
06:08:57.670 --> 06:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
06:09:00.948 --> 06:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
here so so really
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
we are really at the infancy of building
 
06:09:05.270 --> 06:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
this program
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
and we're just starting to
 
06:09:12.470 --> 06:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
really get the program
 
06:09:15.670 --> 06:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
up and ready so that we can start seeing
 
06:09:17.430 --> 06:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
some of those results
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
and it seems like the future is that
 
06:09:24.310 --> 06:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
we would see a lot fewer children at
 
06:09:26.628 --> 06:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
needing hospitalization which is
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably one of the highest
 
06:09:30.868 --> 06:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
cost programs that we have in our budget
 
06:09:30.878 --> 06:09:31.350 align:start position:0%
cost programs that we have in our budget
is

06:09:31.350 --> 06:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:09:33.430 --> 06:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
a psychiatric hospital is probably one
 
06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the highest cost
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
things that we do so it seems like this
 
06:09:41.190 --> 06:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
is money well invested
 
06:09:44.150 --> 06:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
in order to try to bring down some of
 
06:09:44.160 --> 06:09:44.548 align:start position:0%
in order to try to bring down some of
those

06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:09:49.030 --> 06:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
other high-cost programs
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
i i think we should maybe defer
 
06:09:54.788 --> 06:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
an interactive conversation on this to
 
06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:02.788 --> 06:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
um are there any other uh questions
 
06:10:06.628 --> 06:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
from the committee all right
 
06:10:10.850 --> 06:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:10.860 --> 06:10:13.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:10:13.590 --> 06:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:10:15.830 --> 06:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
i would just ask when um this just get
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
discussed at
 
06:10:18.830 --> 06:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
a working session that we make sure to
 
06:10:18.840 --> 06:10:20.150 align:start position:0%
a working session that we make sure to
schedule

06:10:20.150 --> 06:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
06:10:23.910 --> 06:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
joe gripson to also join that discussion
 
06:10:26.548 --> 06:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
we have a working session scheduled for
 
06:10:26.558 --> 06:10:27.590 align:start position:0%
we have a working session scheduled for
wednesday

06:10:27.590 --> 06:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
and i suspect that mr ripple
 
06:10:34.230 --> 06:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
can it's it's in our house calendar but
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
we can certainly
 
06:10:38.708 --> 06:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
make sure mr winston knows i i don't
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
think i'll be able to have the directors
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
available for the meeting on wednesday
 
06:10:44.070 --> 06:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
it conflicts with governor and council
 
06:10:47.270 --> 06:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
for which they also need to attend
 
06:10:48.868 --> 06:10:48.878 align:start position:0%
so i know that you have several working
 
06:10:50.470 --> 06:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
sessions scheduled over the next couple
 
06:10:52.470 --> 06:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
of weeks so hopefully we can
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
or maybe we could talk about it more on
 
06:10:55.750 --> 06:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
friday and um
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
joe ribson's presentation and have erica
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
and katya join that conversation there
 
06:11:03.030 --> 06:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
so so we as you pointed out we have
 
06:11:04.868 --> 06:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
multiple working sessions
 
06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the one on wednesday is our very
 
06:11:08.548 --> 06:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
first one
 
06:11:11.590 --> 06:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
and so i think
 
06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be making anything
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
that feels like a decision
 
06:11:18.070 --> 06:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing is learning
 
06:11:18.080 --> 06:11:18.548 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing is learning
to

06:11:18.548 --> 06:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:11:21.350 --> 06:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
agree with one another about what kind
 
06:11:21.360 --> 06:11:21.670 align:start position:0%
agree with one another about what kind
of

06:11:21.670 --> 06:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:11:23.430 --> 06:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
ways of working we're going to be doing
 
06:11:25.350 --> 06:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
and what the major issues are we need to
 
06:11:25.990 --> 06:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
look at
 
06:11:29.430 --> 06:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
i i doubt if wednesday's
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
going to result in any sort of firm
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
budget decision
 
06:11:37.350 --> 06:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't worry about missing it is
 
06:11:39.190 --> 06:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say
 
06:11:41.910 --> 06:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
right i will be there i just know that
 
06:11:43.430 --> 06:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
the directors will not be able to join
 
06:11:44.948 --> 06:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
us wednesday
 
06:11:48.470 --> 06:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
all right okay someone asked
 
06:11:51.670 --> 06:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry we can go okay
 
06:11:54.470 --> 06:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
the last accounting unit is 2059 uh
 
06:11:54.480 --> 06:11:54.868 align:start position:0%
the last accounting unit is 2059 uh
which

06:11:54.868 --> 06:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:11:58.470 --> 06:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
is a grant that appears to be ending
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
during fiscal year 22
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
so there's not much to talk about on
 
06:12:06.708 --> 06:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:08.628 --> 06:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
so that is the last accounting unit in
 
06:12:11.430 --> 06:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
that area there is still one more bureau
 
06:12:16.070 --> 06:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:19.270 --> 06:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative weiler raised his hand
 
06:12:23.270 --> 06:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh thank you mr chair i had
 
06:12:25.110 --> 06:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
a question while we had karen rounds
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
here that's that's not relevant to this
 
06:12:29.430 --> 06:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
present but maybe she can give me a
 
06:12:31.110 --> 06:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
quick answer i've got a meeting tomorrow
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
with my county commissioners
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
who are really upset over the state
 
06:12:39.830 --> 06:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh increasing the cap 18 and taking 15
 
06:12:41.590 --> 06:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars of state funds out of
 
06:12:41.600 --> 06:12:42.788 align:start position:0%
million dollars of state funds out of
the

06:12:42.788 --> 06:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:12:46.390 --> 06:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
money that used to go into that so it's
 
06:12:47.990 --> 06:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
got to be picked up by the counties it's
 
06:12:49.750 --> 06:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to cause a tax increase in the
 
06:12:50.788 --> 06:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
counties it's
 
06:12:52.150 --> 06:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest one we've had and so we're
 
06:12:55.510 --> 06:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
wondering why that happened
 
06:12:57.830 --> 06:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i think i that's not something i'm
 
06:12:59.510 --> 06:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak about right now it's a
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
much longer conversation than just a few
 
06:13:01.440 --> 06:13:02.628 align:start position:0%
much longer conversation than just a few
minutes

06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
06:13:05.590 --> 06:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
we anticipate discussing that during the
 
06:13:07.030 --> 06:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
division of long-term supports and
 
06:13:08.948 --> 06:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
services budget which i believe is next
 
06:13:08.958 --> 06:13:10.230 align:start position:0%
services budget which i believe is next
week

06:13:10.230 --> 06:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
week
 
06:13:12.310 --> 06:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's where that county cap
 
06:13:12.320 --> 06:13:13.750 align:start position:0%
that's where that county cap
contribution

06:13:13.750 --> 06:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
is is an accounting unit in that
 
06:13:17.350 --> 06:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
division so it would be best to discuss
 
06:13:17.910 --> 06:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
it then
 
06:13:19.350 --> 06:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh when i also have the division
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
director available all right
 
06:13:24.868 --> 06:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
quick answer when i see him tomorrow
 
06:13:25.830 --> 06:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:13:29.350 --> 06:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.350 --> 06:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're ready to plunge on
 
06:13:40.708 --> 06:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
does anyone need to break after that but
 
06:13:44.230 --> 06:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
that felt rougher than most of them
 
06:13:47.670 --> 06:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
you okay miss fox i'm fine
 
06:13:50.548 --> 06:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
what i do want to ask is whether you
 
06:13:52.310 --> 06:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
want to delve into the next
 
06:13:55.590 --> 06:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
bureau with addressing
 
06:13:58.070 --> 06:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
adult mental health services at this
 
06:13:59.910 --> 06:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
06:14:01.830 --> 06:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're prepared to do it but just want to
 
06:14:03.590 --> 06:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
check in with you because
 
06:14:05.830 --> 06:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
it may also take as long as this one it
 
06:14:07.910 --> 06:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
may not have as many
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
um difficult um questions
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
yeah let me uh let me do a pull of the
 
06:14:15.030 --> 06:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee i
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm prone to wanting to go forward so
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
that you guys are
 
06:14:20.948 --> 06:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
relieved of having to come back on
 
06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
wednesday but
 
06:14:25.670 --> 06:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
um representative walner your hand is up
 
06:14:27.670 --> 06:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
do you do you have a question or do you
 
06:14:29.270 --> 06:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
want to comment on whether we should
 
06:14:30.948 --> 06:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
stop or continue
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
well it's 4 15 and i i i mean i think
 
06:14:35.910 --> 06:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
we've been at it for a long time
 
06:14:38.470 --> 06:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
i i i already have another meeting that
 
06:14:40.948 --> 06:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
i'm supposed to be at it for so
 
06:14:43.910 --> 06:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
um i do want to be here for this for
 
06:14:45.510 --> 06:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
this presentation so
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
if we could wait for mond for wednesday
 
06:14:49.270 --> 06:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
for you ma'am we'll wait till wednesday
 
06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
so well
 
06:14:54.628 --> 06:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
it's really for katja more than it is
 
06:14:56.708 --> 06:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
for me if she
 
06:15:00.390 --> 06:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
if she can come back uh mr ripple can
 
06:15:02.628 --> 06:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
can we work out a time for to finish
 
06:15:05.030 --> 06:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bureau
 
06:15:07.270 --> 06:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
i think sure i think whatever works for
 
06:15:08.868 --> 06:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
the department you have the work session
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 9 30 as usual on wednesday
 
06:15:14.948 --> 06:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
if if they're able to start at that time
 
06:15:16.470 --> 06:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
you can start with that and then go into
 
06:15:18.390 --> 06:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
a hospital to conversation or we can
 
06:15:19.990 --> 06:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
start with house bill 2 and then finish
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
this i think it's really
 
06:15:24.628 --> 06:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
we had we had planned it for 1 pm
 
06:15:26.070 --> 06:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
because of governor and council
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
i have i have one contract on governor
 
06:15:36.390 --> 06:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
and council but
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
um i believe that there's a presentation
 
06:15:39.910 --> 06:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
at the beginning
 
06:15:42.390 --> 06:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
of that um starting at 10 so i need to
 
06:15:44.070 --> 06:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
wait that out
 
06:15:46.868 --> 06:15:46.878 align:start position:0%
and i anticipate questions on that um
 
06:15:46.878 --> 06:15:48.070 align:start position:0%
and i anticipate questions on that um
item

06:15:48.070 --> 06:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
item
 
06:15:51.430 --> 06:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
so so that's just a limitation
 
06:15:54.708 --> 06:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
um and i don't see anybody being able to
 
06:15:57.990 --> 06:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
cover council for me okay
 
06:16:02.708 --> 06:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:04.070 --> 06:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
then i think you could start with house
 
06:16:05.750 --> 06:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill two in the morning and then resume
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
this at one pm
 
06:16:10.310 --> 06:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay outstanding so representative
 
06:16:12.150 --> 06:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
wallner do you have another question
 
06:16:13.990 --> 06:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
no thank you thank you very much i
 
06:16:15.350 --> 06:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
06:16:18.868 --> 06:16:18.878 align:start position:0%
okay so so i i heard your request to
 
06:16:22.310 --> 06:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
adjourn for the day um but i want to
 
06:16:25.910 --> 06:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
um give representative nordgren a chance
 
06:16:27.190 --> 06:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you sir so we won't have
 
06:16:34.868 --> 06:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 on by wednesday
 
06:16:38.150 --> 06:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
a physical document probably or
 
06:16:39.430 --> 06:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
well i don't think you'll i don't think
 
06:16:41.110 --> 06:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
you'll have it in hard copy i do think
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
you'll have it because we just saw a
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
draft a couple hours ago
 
06:16:47.430 --> 06:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
from ols and we all took a look at it
 
06:16:48.470 --> 06:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
and let them know
 
06:16:50.948 --> 06:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
if we had concerns and i think they're
 
06:16:52.548 --> 06:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
if they haven't already they're about to
 
06:16:54.470 --> 06:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
email it to representative wyler
 
06:16:59.510 --> 06:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:03.270 --> 06:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
so but when will we get a hard copy
 
06:17:05.990 --> 06:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
a hard copy probably won't get until
 
06:17:09.270 --> 06:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
okay did that answer your question
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes unfortunately yeah
 
06:17:18.470 --> 06:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
all right so i don't want to adjourn
 
06:17:20.708 --> 06:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
without allowing the attendees to raise
 
06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
their hand
 
06:17:23.750 --> 06:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot here this afternoon
 
06:17:25.270 --> 06:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
and there may be
 
06:17:28.070 --> 06:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
some supplemental contra comments from
 
06:17:28.788 --> 06:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
the public
 
06:17:32.868 --> 06:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
so if you if you have uh something
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
germane to any of the things we talked
 
06:17:36.230 --> 06:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
about or
 
06:17:38.868 --> 06:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
you think will help us make some tough
 
06:17:38.878 --> 06:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
you think will help us make some tough
decisions

06:17:39.830 --> 06:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
06:17:46.708 --> 06:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so um oh wait

you've introduced yourself already
 
06:17:59.670 --> 06:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
let me just move him over yeah he
 
06:18:10.230 --> 06:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:12.948 --> 06:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and and members of
 
06:18:14.868 --> 06:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
the committee um and just in the
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
interest of
 
06:18:17.350 --> 06:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
full transparency i want to let you know
 
06:18:19.590 --> 06:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
that while nami new hampshire is not are
 
06:18:21.350 --> 06:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
not treatment providers we do
 
06:18:21.360 --> 06:18:22.230 align:start position:0%
not treatment providers we do
participate

06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
participate
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the fast forward program providing
 
06:18:26.628 --> 06:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
family peer support
 
06:18:28.788 --> 06:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to add a couple of
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
comments one that
 
06:18:32.948 --> 06:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
um in the conversation one thing that
 
06:18:34.708 --> 06:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
that i think is important that was left
 
06:18:36.708 --> 06:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
out is that suicide's the second leading
 
06:18:38.708 --> 06:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
cause of death for our youth
 
06:18:42.070 --> 06:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
ages 10 through 34 and um and young
 
06:18:44.468 --> 06:18:44.478 align:start position:0%
adults and
 
06:18:47.590 --> 06:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
um and we've seen pre-covered
 
06:18:50.628 --> 06:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
the uh it's well documented the rise in
 
06:18:52.390 --> 06:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
anxiety and depression among
 
06:18:54.310 --> 06:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
our youth and young adults and it's
 
06:18:56.468 --> 06:18:56.478 align:start position:0%
gotten considerably worse during covid
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
so i just think that that's an important
 
06:19:00.230 --> 06:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
consideration as we're looking at
 
06:19:03.190 --> 06:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
um at things moving forward and then you
 
06:19:04.548 --> 06:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
know it's at some point
 
06:19:06.230 --> 06:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
um perhaps when there's more of a
 
06:19:08.150 --> 06:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
conversation about mobile crisis
 
06:19:08.160 --> 06:19:08.868 align:start position:0%
conversation about mobile crisis
response

06:19:08.868 --> 06:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
response
 
06:19:12.310 --> 06:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
but to representative weiler's question
 
06:19:14.070 --> 06:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
about how to pay for this
 
06:19:16.788 --> 06:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
there is the federal suicide prevention
 
06:19:18.468 --> 06:19:18.478 align:start position:0%
hotline act which was signed by
 
06:19:20.788 --> 06:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
president trump in october
 
06:19:24.708 --> 06:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
to create a three-digit 988
 
06:19:27.350 --> 06:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention number which by by
 
06:19:29.270 --> 06:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
everyone's agreement is going to become
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
a mental health crisis number
 
06:19:33.990 --> 06:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
and um and that does allow for charging
 
06:19:35.510 --> 06:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
a telecom
 
06:19:38.310 --> 06:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
surcharge to pay for crisis response
 
06:19:41.030 --> 06:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
services i know people may not
 
06:19:44.708 --> 06:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
like that idea but that currently the 75
 
06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
cents we charge for every telecom bill
 
06:19:49.670 --> 06:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
in in new hampshire right now is paying
 
06:19:49.680 --> 06:19:51.270 align:start position:0%
in in new hampshire right now is paying
for

06:19:51.270 --> 06:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:19:53.350 --> 06:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
raising about 14 million dollars in
 
06:19:55.910 --> 06:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
funds that pays for 911
 
06:19:58.468 --> 06:19:58.478 align:start position:0%
in our state so um just something to
 
06:19:58.478 --> 06:19:59.030 align:start position:0%
in our state so um just something to
consider

06:19:59.030 --> 06:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
consider
 
06:20:00.948 --> 06:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
and that that will be implemented
 
06:20:00.958 --> 06:20:02.070 align:start position:0%
and that that will be implemented
nationally

06:20:02.070 --> 06:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
06:20:05.510 --> 06:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
in uh in july of 2022
 
06:20:08.070 --> 06:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
so we need to be thinking about how all
 
06:20:08.080 --> 06:20:08.708 align:start position:0%
so we need to be thinking about how all
that

06:20:08.708 --> 06:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:20:11.430 --> 06:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
how all of what's been spelled out with
 
06:20:13.270 --> 06:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis and system of care
 
06:20:16.948 --> 06:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
folds into a crisis um response
 
06:20:20.708 --> 06:20:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:23.990 --> 06:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm taking your comment to part b
 
06:20:26.468 --> 06:20:26.478 align:start position:0%
potentially part of the answer to the
 
06:20:28.150 --> 06:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
question that got left open
 
06:20:32.390 --> 06:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
about how we would find a um
 
06:20:35.510 --> 06:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
a central um oh god what's the word
 
06:20:38.310 --> 06:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
the words just escape me the the person
 
06:20:40.628 --> 06:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
you call in who distributes the
 
06:20:43.910 --> 06:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
the calls the central call center
 
06:20:47.590 --> 06:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
um that that this 988 answer may be
 
06:20:50.948 --> 06:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh a potential solution to the question
 
06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
of how we're going to come up with a
 
06:20:55.830 --> 06:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:57.910 --> 06:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
well it certainly fits into yes that
 
06:20:58.948 --> 06:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
overall the
 
06:21:01.830 --> 06:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
the central hub that the state is i'm
 
06:21:02.948 --> 06:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
stepping forward
 
06:21:06.948 --> 06:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
and it will tie into 911 as well as
 
06:21:10.548 --> 06:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
2-1-1 in terms of the doorway
 
06:21:13.110 --> 06:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
and probably katya or someone else could
 
06:21:14.708 --> 06:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit more that
 
06:21:17.830 --> 06:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
as they mentioned before that the rfp
 
06:21:20.230 --> 06:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
the request for proposal announcement
 
06:21:21.990 --> 06:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
relative to who is going to get that
 
06:21:24.390 --> 06:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
contract is due to come out relatively
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
soon and there would be more details
 
06:21:28.948 --> 06:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
about that presumably when that contract
 
06:21:30.708 --> 06:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
is announced
 
06:21:32.868 --> 06:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
so so let's let's roll that into the
 
06:21:35.350 --> 06:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
wednesday conversation miss fox if
 
06:21:38.628 --> 06:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
you care to address it then that'll give
 
06:21:42.150 --> 06:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:45.270 --> 06:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
all right um anything else uh
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
i see uh representative nordgren go
 
06:21:47.360 --> 06:21:48.310 align:start position:0%
i see uh representative nordgren go
ahead

06:21:48.310 --> 06:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
06:21:51.430 --> 06:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
maybe we can include this discussion
 
06:21:58.708 --> 06:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
on wednesday um many of you
 
06:22:00.788 --> 06:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
don't know but there's this group called
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
headrest here in the upper valley
 
06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
and that's a suicide prevention hotline
 
06:22:10.310 --> 06:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
they cover new hampshire even part of
 
06:22:10.320 --> 06:22:11.110 align:start position:0%
they cover new hampshire even part of
maine

06:22:11.110 --> 06:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
maine
 
06:22:14.948 --> 06:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
and vermont and so maybe katja can dress
 
06:22:17.350 --> 06:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
how that fits into the whole system i
 
06:22:18.788 --> 06:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it up today
 
06:22:20.310 --> 06:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
because i wasn't sure this is the right
 
06:22:22.390 --> 06:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
time so maybe you can
 
06:22:26.230 --> 06:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
flash that out a little bit on wednesday
 
06:22:28.548 --> 06:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
we will be prepared to do that which was
 
06:22:29.910 --> 06:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
part of our slide deck
 
06:22:31.990 --> 06:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
um as you can see but we'll make sure
 
06:22:34.468 --> 06:22:34.478 align:start position:0%
that we address it specifically
 
06:22:37.750 --> 06:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah they got money in the last budget i
 
06:22:39.190 --> 06:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
think as a footnote
 
06:22:42.390 --> 06:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
200 000 each year but i'm
 
06:22:45.590 --> 06:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
unsure if they got the money or if
 
06:22:48.468 --> 06:22:48.478 align:start position:0%
i we haven't kept i had kevin searching
 
06:22:49.350 --> 06:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
to see
 
06:22:52.468 --> 06:22:52.478 align:start position:0%
if it was included this budget but i
 
06:22:52.478 --> 06:22:52.948 align:start position:0%
if it was included this budget but i
don't

06:22:52.948 --> 06:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:22:55.990 --> 06:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
think having seen it so maybe we could
 
06:22:59.030 --> 06:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
update that sure i can just say yes they
 
06:23:01.030 --> 06:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
got the money and yes it's in the budget
 
06:23:05.670 --> 06:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:07.030 --> 06:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i would just add representative
 
06:23:08.868 --> 06:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
nordgren and yes they are the
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
certified crisis call center for the
 
06:23:12.948 --> 06:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
state that the 988 number would be
 
06:23:14.868 --> 06:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
directed toward
 
06:23:18.310 --> 06:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
at this point in time yeah
 
06:23:20.390 --> 06:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
06:23:20.400 --> 06:23:22.390 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
committee

06:23:22.390 --> 06:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:23:25.270 --> 06:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr norton and then uh
 
06:23:26.468 --> 06:23:26.478 align:start position:0%
last call for
 
06:23:29.270 --> 06:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
the attendees to raise a hand if they
 
06:23:30.310 --> 06:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
have something they
 
06:23:36.948 --> 06:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:39.510 --> 06:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know it can take a second to find
 
06:23:43.350 --> 06:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:46.468 --> 06:23:46.478 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're gonna be back wednesday
 
06:23:48.788 --> 06:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
