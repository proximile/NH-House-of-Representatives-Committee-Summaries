going rogue I'll always announce that
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to uh call our work
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
session um on S SP
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
437 um we had a discussion last time we
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
were in subcommittee on this one and uh
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
a few issues that we kind of wanted to
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
look at um I've looked into those issues
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
um and my personal feeling is the bill
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
is pretty well written um and we should
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
just pass it as it is um I'll open it up
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
to the sub if you have any other
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts or concerns about taking that
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
direction if you'd like to go a
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%

01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
morning all right we have two
 
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
substitutes here representative Melvin
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
is in for representative
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
aaso and representative Schulz is in for
 
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.870 align:start position:0%
aaso and representative Schulz is in for
representative

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
O'Brien right and representative Gard is
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
on his way I'm
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
sure um we have two early bills that we
 
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
need to get out and I think we should
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
take care of those
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
439 I'm going to move and expedient to
 
01:02:25.279 --> 01:02:32.069 align:start position:0%
439 I'm going to move and expedient to
legislate

01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll start by saying
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
that we have always this committee has
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
opposed using the state's purchasing
 
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
power or investment
 
01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:46.309 align:start position:0%
power or investment
power

01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:47.829 align:start position:0%
power
for

01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:50.269 align:start position:0%
for
political

01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
political
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
um well in this case political posturing
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
for a long long time this bill
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
forbids uh discriminating boycotts of
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
Israel and
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's actually ineffective because
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's an executive order that prevents
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
any of the executive agencies from doing
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill would not apply to the
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
treasurer nor the um retirement system
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
because they're not executive agencies
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't apply to anybody and it is
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
purely put in as a making a statement so
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed representative Schmidt thank
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh I agree with your
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
statement uh also I think that uh when
 
01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
when the testimony in in presenting the
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
bill to us was offered uh the state the
 
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
the the language well the statement was
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
made that this is codifying the governor
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
prior executive order right and I asked
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
the question and some of you were there
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
at the time may recall I said has
 
01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:06.829 align:start position:0%
at the time may recall I said has
anything

01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
happened since that executive order was
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
issued that might influence a different
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
take on what's going on uh with regard
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
to a boycott and so forth and so on um
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
and he kind of finessed the answer but
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is in the meantime we've
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
had six months of um a very destructive
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
campaign in Gaza um which I think uh
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
that that's the thing that people are
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
very upset
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
about the the dying the death the
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
killing the destruction that's going on
 
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
in Gaza and the and that has nothing to
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
do in my opinion with a legitimate right
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
of people to protest that at those
 
01:05:00.269 --> 01:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
actions it has nothing to do with a
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
legitimate right to disagree with the
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
with the executive actions of the
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
Israeli government that's not the same
 
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
as being anti-semitic but the but the
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
language of the bill refers to
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism repeatedly that's not what
 
01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
this is about and so forth so I think
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
this this bill does not work and not not
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I wholehearted
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
endorse the idea of voting itl thank you
 
01:05:29.799 --> 01:05:30.910 align:start position:0%
endorse the idea of voting itl thank you
representative

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
leus thank you um I'm going to support
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
the itl uh what I'd like to say is my
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
vote has nothing to do with my views
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
which I have on the situation the Middle
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
East actions of Israel or Palestinians
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
and all of that I just don't want to see
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
the procurement system uh being
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
influenced by whatever the political
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
Winds of the day are and um it should in
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
my view it has one and only one job and
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
that's to get the best deals for the
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Hampshire in uh you
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
know any purchasing Contracting or
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
whatever so that's my reason for
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
supporting it separate from anything
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
that okay anyone else representative
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair I uh I'm not
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to support the the the itl uh
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
although I I agree with the position of
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
the chair that this uh procurement
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
system should not be contaminated with
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
these types of things but I I I don't
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
want to be misconstrued somehow that
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
that was sending a me a message of
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
support to uh to Hamas and and their
 
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
activity so I'm going to be voting
 
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
against the
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
itl all
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
right okay anyone else represents Simon
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just briefly yes I
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
I won't be supporting the itl either
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
although I do 99.9% of the time um agree
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
with the position that you've intimated
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh and I've struggled with this one
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
honestly I see the arguments on both
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
sides um I making the call last minute
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
because I was on the fence uh right up
 
01:07:18.029 --> 01:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
until now um and I guess I land here
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
simply because yes we don't typically
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
deal with intern International Affairs
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
um but our f federal government who does
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
deal in international Affairs has taken
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
a position on this and they continue to
 
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
support um Israel it's an ally of ours
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
who is at this point whether you agree
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
with it or not which I I respect
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
people's um ability to have their
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
opinion on on what's going on what's
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
right and what's not right um but they
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
are in a state of war and so for people
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
within our country to be boycotting an
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
ally of ours who are in a state of War
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem like a precedent we
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
want to set either so for that reason I
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
won't be able to the itl even though yes
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
almost always I would I would fall in
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
made okay anyone
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
else yes rent gold thank you madam chair
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to briefly say that uh my
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
vote will be in support of itl because
 
01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
of the uh responsibility it would put on
 
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
our procurement officers to try to
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
understand what the politics of various
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
corporations are it can be very
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
complicated my person personal views are
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
um are what they are and they support
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
who they support but I just don't see
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
that tangling up with what we require
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
our procurement people to do in the
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
divis in the
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam chair as you
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
know I will not be supporting itl and I
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
think probably a representative Simon
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
and Dolan probably already said uh where
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
I uh where I stand on that issue um I I
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
would like to comment uh repent Schmidt
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
I I always appreciate and respect what
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
you say at at at Great length and and I
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't think
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
that listening to the testimony there
 
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
were certainly ought to talk about the
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
the current happenings in the Middle
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
East but the boycott devest uh
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
divestment and sanctions
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
policy to impact Israel has been in
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
place long before October 7th and so I
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't look at it that me being concerned
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
about the boycott process has anything
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%

Minority Report well I wasn't really
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
volunteering but it seems like one of us
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
should do that I would
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
think at a as six people voted for it so
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh I guess yeah I am so you're you are
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
volunteering for that but I guess
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:23.000 align:start position:0%

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
motion

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
so the amendment um this this um bill
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
went to
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and um it refers to the
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
real estate Practice Act and
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
specifically refer um adds a what
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
postlicensing what that what that
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
definition is and per the
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
um board we um they asked for a time
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
change of February 1st 2024 rather than
 
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
February 1st
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
2020 and that was the um amendment made
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
in committee
 
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
yes it I'd like to mention that this
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
amendment deletes the sections we had
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
some issues with like the single person
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
for each of the larger
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
um the larger boards are not supporting
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
themselves very well the
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
um the the fees are in the process of
 
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.070 align:start position:0%
um the the fees are in the process of
being

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
readjusted and so we don't quite know
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
how much each board will have available
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
for extra
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
um but I thought that made a lot of
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
sense and also
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
director Courtney was concerned that
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
having one person dedicated to each
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
board would create a single point of
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
failure because that person would do
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
everything and nobody else would know
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
how things ran or how to answer the
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
questions and so she
 
01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
was she was opposed to the idea
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
particularly it being
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
mandated if it turns out that it is a
 
01:14:23.229 --> 01:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
good idea to have a dedicated person or
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
two for one of the larger boards that's
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
well within the opl's authority to
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
there all right any questions man py
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a quick
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
question looks like the amendment
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
Bill am I correct representative
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
gr yes you might remember that in the
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
bill we had for sections and we said we
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
were going to adopt two of
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
else okay that case the motion is to
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 1568 H to Senate Bill
 
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
480 and the clerk and call the war
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%

I move a to pass with as amended on

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
right right do you need to speak to your
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
motion I don't believe so I think we
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
discussed most of it with the discussion
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
on the amendment okay sh
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
it I'll just say that basically with the
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
amendment this is what uh
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Quinn from the board requested so I
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
think we're making everyone
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
happy oh what a marvelous idea if that
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
were to be the
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
that exactly anyone else have a comment
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
question okay in that case the motion is
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
to for Senate Bill 480 ought to pass
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%

01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
yes 20 a0 n all right motion passes 20
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
to Zer does anyone have an objection to
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
consent the bill as amended takes out
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
the the expense so I think it's small
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
enough to go on
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
consent no objection we'll put it on
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
bill but they won't have much to
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
and okay let's try Senate Bill
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
437 since we've got several people here
 
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
Simon uh thank you madam chair the
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee took a look at this um bill
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
and we are moving a to pass is there a
 
01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.870 align:start position:0%
and we are moving a to pass is there a
second

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.830 align:start position:0%
second
I'll

01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
second representative Dolan was
 
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Simon you wish to
 
01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion um yeah so there
 
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
were a lot of moving Parts on this bill
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
um and so uh we were able to take a bit
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
of a deeper dive in the subcommittee uh
 
01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
meeting and um as such I was able to
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
gain a greater understanding of the
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
language and and how it's been
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
constructed um to kind of address the
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that were brought up during the
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
initial public hearing ing um one of the
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
things that really kind of clarified
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
things for me was language changes
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
throughout uh in present RSA the words
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
were provision and regulations now
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
they're amendments meaning that uh if
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to make a change to the
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
building code uh you have to amend a
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
code that's actually been adopted by um
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
the state um board and uh so uh kind of
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
just looking down through the
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill um basically what it uh prevents
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
from happening is on the um municipal
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
level uh keeps individual municipalities
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
from adopting wholesale code that hasn't
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
been approved by the building code
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
review board or basically um adopting
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
full code by a Thousand Cuts uh just
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
doing a thousand different changes to
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
try to get to a new code it basically
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
prohibits those two things um and the
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
reason for that is is basically uh for
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
consistency across the state the fear is
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
that uh um without this um people who
 
01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
are doing work throughout the state
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
won't know from one municipality to
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
another you know what the rules are for
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
that particular municipality and uh it
 
01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
really would just undermine the idea of
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
having a building code review board at
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
all so basically just says that if you
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
um want to have a rule that's more
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
stringent uh than one that the uh
 
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
building code review board at the state
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
level has adopted um that just needs to
 
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
come uh to the building code review
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
board at the state level uh to be looked
 
01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
at and to be confirmed uh that it meets
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
the criteria um and if it hasn't gone to
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
the building code review board Within 60
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
days and and um had that confirmation
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
happen then it's not um effective on the
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
state level it can't be um so what I'm
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
looking for enforced enforced thank you
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
it can't be enforced on the local level
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
so it would give um private citizens a
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
right to civil uh civil action um if a
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
town was trying to enforce a code um
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
that would had not gone through the
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
legal process um I've been told by
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
Council and our own Council that yes it
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
would give a a right to civil action um
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
by an individual uh in in the State uh
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
to recoup the added expense that wasn't
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
um legally put in place so uh thought it
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
was in the end thought it was pretty
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
well written and uh uh made sense to us
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
so that's why I move OTP okay Dolan do
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
second I think the vice
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
chair coined well so I'm in support of
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
us repr Brown thank you madam chair so
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
to representative assignment for me to
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
be clear which apparently is hard
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes the some of the concern about
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
this was what you said that there would
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
be towns that would have
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
differing building codes per town and
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
what you just said they will only be
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
able to ask for an amendment to the
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
State Building Code but will if I
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
understood what you just said will that
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
then be that
 
01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
Town's piece of the building code or
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
will that change the entire state code I
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
no it would just it would just adjust it
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
within that municipality I mean it does
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
a few other things too it's a it's a
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot in the bill um it would
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
allow them to look at other National
 
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
codes uh and adopt some code that isn't
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
addressed by the State Building Code so
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
there are some things that our building
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
code doesn't address they can adopt
 
01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
those things on the local level as well
 
01:22:21.629 --> 01:22:21.639 align:start position:0%
um but yes it would just be effective in
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
their town but it has to be attached to
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
they have to to be amending a code that
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
has already been adopted by the state
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
building code and then passed through
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature they can't just go
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly at it okay and follow up
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
sorry it also means that a local
 
01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment will be reviewed by the
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
building code review board who
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
understands it and it will be publicized
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
so that everybody
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
knows which I which has been a problem
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
you pres G hark thank you just quick
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
question how is it publicized how how
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
will it be
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
publicized it will be on the building
 
01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:05.639 align:start position:0%
code Review Board website along with the
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
State Building Code okay and presumably
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
if a town adopts an amendment they'll
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
have it in their town office along with
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
their copy of the building
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
code okay thank you m I'm sure um yeah
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
one of the other reasons for the bill is
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
it is a they wanted to basically have a
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
clearing house where any codes and
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
amendments to codes in different
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities would all be located in
 
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
the same spot so if you had a question
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
you could go to the State Building Code
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
you know website uh for that town find
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
out what the amended codes are and you
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
would know where you're looking so that
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's not you know a question right now
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
because it's not going through the
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
building code review board all over the
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
time it's not necessarily being posted
 
01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
there you could go into municipality and
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's your word against theirs without
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
doing some real research as to and
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not that town or municipality
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
um adopted the code through the legal
 
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
process did they go through an ordinance
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
did they you know did they do all that
 
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
work or is it just the local enforcement
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
agency basically saying well this is the
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
way that I want it to be so that's what
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to do
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing none representative
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so we're
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
heading in the direction of a more
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and informed
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
process uh in terms of this the inter
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
inter ational and National
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
standards uh and having an an expert uh
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
board building
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
called review board the chairman is with
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
us this
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
morning and uh and so that's to the good
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
because it was more halfhazard before
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
and you had situations in some
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
localities where ordinances were being
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
adopted in an in in an illegal fashion
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
where there was no real legality to it
 
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
and that should not be possible um and
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is this is one of the things that
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
this would get rid of um so this is
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
definitely a step in the right direction
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of giving localities more of a
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
handle on the way that things need to be
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
done and more confidence in the the the
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh standards that are being promulgated
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
because they've been reviewed by the
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
building code review board before they
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
propagated at a state level and a
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
locality cannot Trump the state the
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
state code that you can have more
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
stringent standard but you can't say we
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
don't want that okay so this is
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
definitely an enhancement of the overall
 
01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
process okay thank you anyone else
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
personent Gart and the brown just quick
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
question was did you say International
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
thises is international codes that we're
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
adopting yes some of them are
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
international meaning the United States
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
and whoever chooses to go along with us
 
01:26:04.239 --> 01:26:05.390 align:start position:0%
and whoever chooses to go along with us
thank

01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you madam chair so for
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative Simon from from the
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so it is possible that 10
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities could have a slightly
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
different code than the state code or 20
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities or
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
30 technically all of the
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities yeah it would have to be
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
an amendment to a specific code that has
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
already been adopted by the building
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
code review board and subsequently
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
passed through us so we would have to
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
vote on that but yes they can they can
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
amend that to make it a little bit more
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
restrictive if they want to um but it
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
stringent yes more stringent sorry thank
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
you for the clarification um yes but it
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
would still keep it within the same code
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay and followup follow so did you get
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
a feeling in subcommittee
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
that this process might control
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
so much inconsistency throughout the
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
state that there might be 100
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities with a different code
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
process yes okay representative Shu and
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
then laus thank you madam chair um I do
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
have I guess You' call it a question for
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative Simon is this similar to
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
from time to time in my town we vote on
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
updating our zoning codes and it will
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
state to conform with State Standards is
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
that the idea the same thing with
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
this no well the
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
it's it wouldn't be to conform with
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
State Standards because the State
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
Building Code applies it would be to
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
make a special distinction for Penbrook
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
state although if if a 100 or 200 towns
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
start adopting the same Amendment
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's a darn good chance it should
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
apply to the rest of the state but I
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
believe we heard that there were five
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
towns that had actually submitted
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
amendments which is a pretty tiny number
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
represent laus yeah and this might um
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
help with I don't know U represent
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
Brown's thing um my understanding of the
 
01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
history and please anybody who's been
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
here longer correct me if I'm wrong is
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
that there one time there was no State
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
Building Code and every town could adopt
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
their own set of rules on building and
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
um so when the uh State Building Code
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
was adopted instead of uh just saying
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
towns have no flexibility
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um the decision was made to
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
allow them in some controlled process to
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
have their own amendments to the code
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
for whatever the local circumstances are
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
now while I might not like that actually
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have the state only
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
code I'd rather not have the local towns
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
make it more restrictive I still see
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
this as an improvement I'm going to
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
support it because at least it makes the
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
process regularizes it U makes it have
 
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
to go through official process there's
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
some review that they're not just
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
completely you know off thewall on what
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing and it keeps it all in one
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
place so at least people who are in the
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
trades and Builders can can figure out
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
what's going
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
ones Simon yeah um I was going to
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
mention that as well representative
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
Brown you we've talked about making it
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
more restrictive but the initial concern
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
was that they were dealing with code
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
that was 10 Cycles behind or five Cycles
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
behind and and the and so they were
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
running into issues with insurance
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
coverage and things of that nature the
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
other way that it helps to the question
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
that you were asking before is um even
 
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
though they have made these amendments
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
as representative leus just said they'll
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
all be locatable in one spot so so we so
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
the state knows what those are Builders
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
can go and find out what those those are
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
they're not going to show up on site and
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
have the the local um code guy basically
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
just throw something at them without
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
them having any ability to go verified
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether that's gone through the legal
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
process um so that becomes so you can
 
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
still fight that sort of thing but it
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
comes very expensive for the Builder for
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
the client um because now you've got to
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
take actual legal action this would this
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
would simplify that process and allow
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
them to find those codes um that have
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
gone through the legal process much more
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
easily thank thank you both
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%

the Senate Senator Murphy had uh drafted
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment and I got it changed to a
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a
 
01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.270 align:start position:0%

01:32:14.109 --> 01:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
right gr do you wish to speak to your
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else comments questions represent
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
gold do you have more well I I just was
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to say that all the amendment does
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
is to increase um increase the
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
apprentices to two that a plumber is
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
allowed from one and uh fixed some
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
language that made it sound like it was
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to mention that it still
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the uh federal labor
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program and I would
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
imagine that all of the larger companies
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
that are going to be going for federal
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
contracts will be complying with the
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
requirements of that uh
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
program but the smaller
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
businesses that have enough enough to do
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
keeping up with the the local work will
 
01:33:19.709 --> 01:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
be able to have two app two
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships which will
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.719 --> 01:33:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
else

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.109 --> 01:33:39.119 align:start position:0%

01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes yes Madam chair I would like to move
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.709 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
20241

01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.350 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay sign you wish to speak to it um
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so the amendment is very simple um
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
in the original bill it made it sound
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
like we were going to leave um public
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
comment open um like verbal testimony
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
open for 10 days which seemed uh
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
unworkable uh that people would be able
 
01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:37.159 align:start position:0%
to show up for 10 days and and testify
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
verbally uh so this just splits up um
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
chapter 7 and chapter 8 into basically
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
saying that you can give spoken comment
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
um and that the written testimony will
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
be open for submission it was 7 Days uh
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
we changed it to 10 days because that's
 
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
the general practice
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
um with uh the ability to submit written
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um so we felt like maybe that
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
was not the part uh to speed up um but
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
to allow the public ample time um we
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
sped up some of the processes the the
 
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
regular Bill speeds up some of the
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
processes and the rest of uh rest of the
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh process sorry for using the same word
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
four times um but it only changes it to
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
10 days here so that was the amendment
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
okay represent Brown you wish to comment
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
amendment okay the motion is to adopt

01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
was a bill that we passed last year but
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
the governor had some concerns uh with
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
it as it was written last year so uh
 
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
this bill has addressed that we believe
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
it's addressed those concerns um having
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
to deal with special exceptions for
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
emergency hearings and disciplinary
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
remedial proceedings things of that
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
nature um so we've we've created some
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
exceptions uh for those issues we think
 
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
it'll be agreeable to the governor at
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:03.189 align:start position:0%

gold um excuse me that's okay I move
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's right a of pass with amendment to
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
306 okay is there a
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
second second second by represent
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
goalie all right any further discussion
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
comments questions
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
well I could add that Senate Bill 306
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
allows the state to have its own
 
01:44:28.719 --> 01:44:30.270 align:start position:0%
allows the state to have its own
resolution

01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
um dispute resolution process as opposed
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
to allowing it to be done on the HUD
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
level so by adopting the amendment we
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
have made it incompliant with HUD and
 
01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
therefore we can establish our own State
 
01:44:48.589 --> 01:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
process and I will I'd like to add that
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
we have heard not just on this bill but
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
on many other cases that nobody wants to
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
deal with the the federal HUD
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
regulations so they really want to have
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
process any other comments questions
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
goie all right that case the motion is
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment on Senate
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%

Bill 485 that was different from Senate
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 4 13 from House Bill
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
1385 would be um considered so we wrote
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the part that was
 
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
unique to Senate Bill 485 was the
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
digitally verifiable licenses and the
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
amendment is 1517 2024
 
01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:59.070 align:start position:0%
amendment is 1517 2024
1517

01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
1517
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
however the um I heard from both um
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
director Courtney and I spoke with
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner goule this
 
01:47:11.229 --> 01:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
morning that digitally verifiable
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
licenses are much more complicated than
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
one would have originally
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
thought and we don't know what the cost
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
would be and there's only one state
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's doing this and it requires
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
accessibility or data interface with
 
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
other states to
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
know what their credentialing
 
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
is so the long story short is I'm going
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
to move interim study on Senate Bill
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
485 until we
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
understand we have a better
 
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
clarification as to what's involved
 
01:47:55.229 --> 01:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
second second by representative
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
Schmidt all right representative Schmidt
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
motion you're recognizing me uh I I
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
think that there's some issues here uh
 
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask representative gr to
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
right off the bat what is the other
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
state that that is I don't know I'm
 
01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't know no no it would be
 
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to find that out but there there
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
are some is isues here that are that
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
need to be clarified before we can go
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
forward maybe it's a good idea I'm not
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
sure too many unanswered question so
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
let's let's do interim study okay
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
represent leus thank you yeah I'm not
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to oppose interim study I'm just
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
wondering what is it that this bill
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
intended to do that wasn't covered by
 
01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
bill so the the the house bill and the
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill are both trying to assist in
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
the uh licensing of the mil of military
 
01:49:04.990 --> 01:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
folk and so in the the the person that
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
presented this part of the amendment you
 
01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
might remember is is someone who owns a
 
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
company that does
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
this so there was some concern that they
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
may be the only company that do this and
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have and we certainly wouldn't
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
sign up with only one company
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore what are the requirements
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
and it's a feel that we are not
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
currently this is sort of Cutting Edge
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
computer technology software technology
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we are not on The Cutting Edge of
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
that follow up um so so is it that
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
really the only thing this was intended
 
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
to add beyond the house bill was the
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
digital correct thank you
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brown um I think
 
01:49:56.669 --> 01:49:56.679 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know thank you Madame
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
chair my
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
apologies I'm so recuperating from my
 
01:50:00.679 --> 01:50:03.709 align:start position:0%
apologies I'm so recuperating from my
Senate

01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
testimony you're lucky you got out of
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
there alive you have not done that
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
before um I I think on the amendment on
 
01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.709 align:start position:0%
before um I I think on the amendment on
line

01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
25 sorry line 23 new paragraph Yes yes I
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
see that I think
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
that we did want that
 
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
to be changed uh in 1385 but we didn't
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
do it because we were too short of time
 
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
so we may have to put what is on line 25
 
01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:35.719 align:start position:0%
and 26 in 1385 as an amendment on the
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
Senate side no no because we still have
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
if I'm not correct this is not an early
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
bill so if you want me to draft an
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that only that basically
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
eliminates par section one and talks
 
01:50:55.229 --> 01:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
about about we do need something we we
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
had talked about section
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
two which is to allow
 
01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
um the military education and the MOs
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
related issue addressed and we also
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to um adopt that all boards not
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
only those that are under
 
01:51:19.149 --> 01:51:19.159 align:start position:0%
oplc complete the ru making requirement
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
so if the commiss if the committee
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
wishes is I can submit an amendment and
 
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
bring it next week for section two only
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
and we deal with digitally verifiable
 
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
licenses separately at a later time does
 
01:51:38.109 --> 01:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
that is that amable to the committee so
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
the if I understand you correctly you're
 
01:51:41.119 --> 01:51:42.990 align:start position:0%
the if I understand you correctly you're
suggesting

01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
that you incl include section two which
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
is getting each board to decide
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
what uh military occupation is related
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
to their
 
01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
board which we've been trying to do for
 
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
several years and haven't had a lot of
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
success and it's not in 1385 it's not in
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
1385 so this would be a charge to the
 
01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.189 align:start position:0%
1385 so this would be a charge to the
boards

01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
to do some of this work correct so if if
 
01:52:16.350 --> 01:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
if the committee agrees what the
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
amendment would look like is amend the
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill Title by replacing it with the
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
following and we would just jump
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
automatically to line
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
18 where we talk about training
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
education and service and we would leave
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
out paragraph
 
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.390 align:start position:0%
out paragraph
one

01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:35.400 align:start position:0%

tomorrow if OLS could get it in time we
 
01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
could even do it
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
possibility well I could just pit down
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
