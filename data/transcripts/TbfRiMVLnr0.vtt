well as I'm currently the chair of the
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee um for the

familiar with the charitable gaming laws
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that being said we're going to move
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
on to electing a new chair um this is an
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting um to reform and
 
00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
then upon electing a chair um we'll have
 
00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
a presentation from Lottery one thing
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
when we get to the presentation I'm
 
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
hoping we'll do is we'll hold all
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
questions while Charlie gets through his
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
entire presentation and then ask
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions so we don't interrupt them
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
because we'll probably find it on a
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
later slide so
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative bomy yes uh thank you
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang um are you we can approve
 
00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
the minutes first uh well I was going to
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
have the chair elected but I can do that
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
so there's minutes presented for August
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
14th um I'd entertain a motion the
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
minutes well the reason I said that I'm
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
missing from the minutes as being
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
present thank you so so we get a motion
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
then we can amend them so okay you move
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
sort of point of a question
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
um last time we didn't really sort of
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
have a official minutes keeper and
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
somebody had to help the committee um I
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
had spoken last time about bringing some
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
of the folks I work with to help and I
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
brought somebody I don't know don't know
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
if you've arranged for somebody to sort
 
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
of act as an assistant or I I I brought
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who works with me to do that if
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
you so I think the plan was for your
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
person to do it uh John represented
 
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
janigian is our official clerk okay so
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
once the minutes are taken if you can
 
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
forward on to him and then he'll
 
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399 align:start position:0%

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to we need to
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
address all of those things um when I
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
chair I chaired the marijuana commission
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
years ago um we took a blank sheet of
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
paper and we said okay if we were to do
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
legalization of marijuana what should it
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
look like I think that's what this
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
commission should be doing it's a new
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
world we should be looking at Char
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
gaming I think we all support charal
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
gaming here we want to see charal gaming
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh but we want to make sure that with
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
the new landscape that the way we
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
approach it is what we want as this
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
group and the final report of this will
 
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
be a guide hopefully we create a guide
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
for the legislature going forward as to
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
what we want charitable gaming to look
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
like so this is very important
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
commission uh again we've grown up from
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
a mom and pop operations to Big Time
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
Casino companies coming in so it's it's
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
just a moment in time that we need to
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
pause and we need to address all the
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
issues and I do have a handout I'll give
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
out later about that so with that um
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
Charlie you're
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
up so if you look at your minutes
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.710 align:start position:0%
up so if you look at your minutes
we

00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
theed right obviously we're going to
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
make sure we meet the five Charters um I
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
other issues that are going to
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
arise um and it's up to the group if we
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
think we're straying from the task then
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
we won't go there but I know in the
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana commission we went were let us
 
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
um because it was an important issue and
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
we came up with 54 recommendations that
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
were outside the bounds of that so if
 
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
you want to stay with these five things
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
fine some some of my issues may fall
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
Within These five or six whatever it is
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
five um but yeah
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr CH I I think all of us
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
know that charitable gabing is here to
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
stay I don't think there's any question
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
about that it's how charitable gaming is
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
run is charitable gaming fulfilling the
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
rationale for charitable gaming are all
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the players playing under the same
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
rules and are those rules being applied
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
uniformly across the board and indeed
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
security that we talk about being being
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
necessary for this to work is that in
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
place and is that functioning is that
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
functioning charitable charitable Gabby
 
00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
functioning charitable charitable Gabby
has

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
become a huge entity in in in our state
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
I think we have operating at the present
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
time at least 12 casinos at least 12 and
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many others around
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
under uh under preparation for for
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
opening at at the present time uh there
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
was a time when proliferation was a real
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
concern of the people of the State of
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and a real concern of the
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
legislature and obviously that's not a
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
concern anymore and as a result of that
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
I think uh the landscape has changed and
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
as legislators it's our job to make sure
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
that the landscape is the landscape that
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
we organized we brought forward and we
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
legislated and if that's not if that's
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
not the case then things have to be done
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
to correct that I served on the
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
commission uh a number a number of years
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
ago and we did annunciate a number of
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
things that had to be taken care of I
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
think some of those have been but some
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
of those have not so those are the
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
things that we have to I think we have
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility that's an awesome resp
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
gaming gaming is on television more than
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
the damn
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
news every I mean they're beating
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
prescriptions I'd say you get your
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
prescriptions at
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
DraftKings that's the place to go there
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
are more ads for gaming on television
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
than anything else to me it's it's
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
unbelievable so these these are things
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
that have happened over the last couple
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
of years that that really uh are are
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
important very important uh and what
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
what about the habitual
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
Gibler how what what place is that in
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
our society and where and where's that I
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
guess I've spoken too long but thank you
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
comments thank you um yes I I agree with
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh um the sentiment that we need to look
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
broadly and I think that's uh that that
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
need is you look at these five bullet
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
points it becomes immediately evident
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
whether the state should limit the
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
number of charitable gaming
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
locations uh well how do you answer that
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
question you need to dive deeply into uh
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
what the demand is what the other states
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
have done in terms of limiting or not
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
limiting uh charal gaming sites and uh
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
and why they've done that and uh how
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
that affects revenue and another one is
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
whether more HHR licens would increase
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
reduce revenues to Charities again you
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
got to dive deeply to figure that one
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
out and uh so I I think we need to look
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
broadly in order to answer these
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions and I concur with Senator
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
delandro that uh this is a time where
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's very important to do so it's uh New
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is moving on uh on the
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
gambling issue and we need to make sure
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
it's moving in a good direction okay
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments okay
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%

okay just have your other people
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%

yeah

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:27.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
if if you would be so kind to not tell
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
admin services that I use color Inc I'd
 
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.630 align:start position:0%
admin services that I use color Inc I'd
appreciate

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
it um good morning everyone once again
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre director of Hampshire
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
Lottery with me is Valerie King who's
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
head of our licensing and John con who
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
is the Lottery's Chief compliance
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
officer uh and they do this a lot more
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
than I do so I'll look look to them to
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
answer questions and go through this as
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
you go through this presentation but
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
certainly we'll start with the basics I
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
imagine this will be the first of many
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
times that I or my colleagues will be
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
sitting here asking questions and and
 
00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:08.919 align:start position:0%
and the like so I'll you know we'll
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
start at the beginning and work our way
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
forward obviously the Charities derive
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
significant revenue from the operation
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
of charitable gambling one area we do
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
not regulate which has often come under
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
um question is
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
Raffles we have nothing to do with
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
Raffles so the if you have a raffle and
 
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
city or town you seek permission from
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
that city or town usually the police
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
department um permits you for a raffle
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
held in that town or sometimes you don't
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
seek PR it and we don't know about it so
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise there are four areas
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
essentially of trable gambling that we
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
regulate Bingo uh Lucky Seven which are
 
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
obviously I think everyone knows what
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
Bingo is I certainly grew up helping
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
Bingo when a St ANS and quiny um Lucky
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
Seven are called pull tabs other names
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
are also called break open or seal cards
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
these are cards you can buy that you
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
break open and if you match you win um
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
they are the comparator or the companion
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
really to bingo games you have to bingo
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
license to sell Lucky s tickets and they
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
are the profit Center for most Charities
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
that do run bingo bingo is actually lost
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
leader but Lucky 7 tickets make money a
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
number of years ago our predecessor
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
agency not ours but the predecessor
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
agency racing and triable gambling
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
approved machines what year was that 15
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
2015 2015 and shortly after that we were
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
they were merged with us and became one
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
agency essentially all gambling in the
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
state in the Lottery
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
Commission third area is games of chance
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
obviously which are Casino style games
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
and historic horse racing is the fourth
 
00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll go through them one at the
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
time Val you want to SC Bingo want me
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
um so just to give you an overview of
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
bingo it's it's your traditional Bingo
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
we don't do electronic Bingo it's it's
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
all your traditional callers calling
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
numbers at the um local Bingo halls um
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
they're they're generally held at
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
commercial bingo halls but they can also
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
be held at um locations owned by a
 
00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
charity like a a basement of a church or
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
whatever um they must be operated by the
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
organization they can have assistance
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
from licensed gaming Consultants but the
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
charity is the one in charge and
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be operating the the
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
games um the charitable organization
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
retains all of the revenue that they
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
generate with the exception of a 7% um
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
fee on carry over coverall and winner
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
take all games which the state
 
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.510 align:start position:0%
take all games which the state
collects

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
collects
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
um as as Charlie mentioned Bingo itself
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
is a loss leader which is why they often
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
sell Lucky Seven tickets at their bingo
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
events because that's really where the
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
money is made and they have different
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
fun little games like Charlie mentioned
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
seal cards that help uh generate most of
 
00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:13.190 align:start position:0%
seal cards that help uh generate most of
their

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
revenue and that's the the basics of
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
bingo okay uh second obviously Lucky
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
Seven and Lucky Seven as it described is
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
sold in two ways one is through paper an
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
actual physical ticket that is printed
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
and sold in deal sizes and the second is
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
through a machine and is similarly sold
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
in a deal but is rendered
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
electronically and printed on paper but
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
is not the primary way the W the person
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
finds out if they want or not
 
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.430 align:start position:0%
finds out if they want or not
um

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
The Lucky Seven tickets have a payout
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
similar to what a scratch ticket would
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of priz to the player
 
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
um the state receives a deal fee of $15
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
per deal of $3600 tickets 3600 tickets
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine this is not
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
particularly what's our revenue from
 
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.710 align:start position:0%
particularly what's our revenue from
Lucky

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
Lucky
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
7 uh for deal for year for year I think
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
it's like two two two two million about
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
two million about two million a year for
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
for Lucky 7 both um physical as well as
 
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.350 align:start position:0%
for Lucky 7 both um physical as well as
mechanical

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
mechanical
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
machines yeah just interjected one thing
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
I just want fire five
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
the Lucky Sevens used to be uh only able
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
to be sold in conjunction with bingo
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
games but um the legislature did make a
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
change I believe two years ago to allow
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
at games of chance facilities um so
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
there are a few games of chance
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that have electronic Lucky 7
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
um those are generally the facilities
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
that do not have uh historic horse
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
racing um and so obviously as historic
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
hor racing has come on it's replaced a
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
lot of that electronic Lucky 7 um
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh business um but it is still um
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
possible and it does happen that Lucky
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
Seven sales do take place at games and
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
license want you walk through games a
 
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.909 align:start position:0%
license want you walk through games a
chance

00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
chance
 
00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:24.549 align:start position:0%
chance
do

00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
chance uh so uh Tim do you the emails of
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
commission yeah so uh you should be
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
copying on a couple emails that have
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
everybody in but I'll make make sure you
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
get them okay because I was going to
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
pass something around but no I'll make
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
sure you get Mr chairman I know Kelly
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
right so with with games of chance uh as
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier those are your Casino
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
tile games your black Blackjack your
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
poker your roulette um they're
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
technically they can be operated by a
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
charity but it's really not feasible so
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're operated at games of chance
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
calls basically your casinos we have
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
approximately 14 14 14 licensed game
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
rooms at this time
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
um each charity in order to operate
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
games of chance at at one of these uh
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
facilities you have to have a charity
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
host charity and each charity gets 10
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
game dates per year um at yeah up to 10
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
games game dates per year the revenue
 
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
that the um the room earns on that game
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
night the charity gets 35% and the game
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
operator retains 65% however the game
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
operator can also charge rent um on top
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
and and so that reduces the Chari
 
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.710 align:start position:0%
and and so that reduces the Chari
portion

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
portion
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:02.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
right so so the the state does take uh
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
10% of the it's 10% of house winnings is
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
what the state tax is unless it's a
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
tournament which is 3% of the money put
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
tournament and that's the last bullet
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
so and S of lastly and the certainly one
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
of the areas that's been focused for the
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
last few months uh historic horse racing
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
which was approved during the last
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislative session um it is the
 
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.750 align:start position:0%
legislative session um it is the
replay

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
replay
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
in of priorly run horse races
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
randomized um for display with an
 
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
entertaining display um for a
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
player um these exist I think in five
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
states I think it's five states around
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
the us none near us the closest I think
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
is Virginia um Iowa Arkansas has it too
 
00:30:33.559 --> 00:30:35.909 align:start position:0%
is Virginia um Iowa Arkansas has it too
um

00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
and right now I think within the state
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
there are 1500
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
1500 1,00 1500 machines in the state and
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
so one of the what was that number again
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's the, 1400 150000 I can get
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
you the exact number but it changes
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
daily as you could imagine some come
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
offline some go online some get repaired
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
some get moved but how many how many
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
facilities actually have them so at this
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
point it's yeah it's 10 facilities have
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
them now and that number is growing but
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
to put it in context if I could because
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
there's a certainly a perception when
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking 12 15 16 um Twin Rivers
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
has 3,500 machines in it so to put it in
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
context in terms of size it's still a
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
fraction of as big as the one in Rhode
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
Island at Twin Rivers so it's
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
not there aren't 14 siiz Twin Rivers
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state there are or 10
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
there are are all told they don't equal
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
half of what Twin Rivers has in terms of
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
gaming machines I'm going to call them
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
gaming machines people call them what
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
they want but the legislature called
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
them historic hor racing machines I
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree they are gaming
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
machines by the broad definition that
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
our industry uses them um and I don't
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
like the other words that we we call
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
them so
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
um and so it's a maximum of 12% of the
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
handle is taken out I think right now
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's running about 10 yeah it's slightly
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
10 yeah
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
yeah exact but up 10% so every dollar
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
put in 90 cents is coming back out as
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
winnings to the player the remaining 10
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
cents is left over um there's a unit of
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
measure in our business called win per
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
unit per day it's how much is left in in
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
the tail after a player played a bunch
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
one lost one lost one one lost lost um
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
and of that dollar that's in the tails
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
for example 75 cents goes to the
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
operator uh 16.2
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
5 sense goes to the Lottery Commission
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
and 8.75 is shared between the two
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
Charities that are hosting the events at
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
that facility that
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
night oh sorry I just of um because I I
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
led my boss astray uh so I just checked
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
the last time we did a census at the end
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
of August it was 1,600 machines um
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's grown uh since then um as Charlie
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
said that will change literally day to
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
day certainly week to week week and so
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
we do track that every month or so so at
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
this point it's probably as I said last
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
census was 1618 machines um that'll
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
probably be closer to 1,800 the next
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
time we do that sorry than
 
00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
um one of the rules that we promulgated
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
through jail car approval is that HHR
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue cannot exceed by more than 6.33
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
times uh table Revenue the games of
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
chance Revenue that's for a very
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
specific reason is because on games of
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
chance Revenue the charity receives 35
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
cents in the Dollar on a store horse
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
racing Revenue they receive
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
eight machines are far easier to run and
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
manage they are far easier and cheaper
 
00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
to regulate they are cheaper to deal
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
with and so I we didn't want a situation
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
where the Charities which is the reason
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing this
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
are are held to a det ment because it's
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
easier to have machines that it is to
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
have dealers at tables and surveillance
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
cameras and Pit Bosses and change of
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
shifts and all that and so we want to
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that in any end that no the
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
Charities would not lose out on this
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
process that um all the table games
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
would go away and there' be nothing but
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
machines and buildings and the like so
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
um those places have certain names none
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
of which are appealing so that's the
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
reason for that rule
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.310 align:start position:0%
reason for that rule
um

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
and if they do exceeded that number then
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
half of the HHR Revenue goes to the
 
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
Charities at night it's not a
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
disincentive it's not a punishment it's
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
just meant that you probably should have
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
spent more time promoting charitable
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
gambling versus you know your profit
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
line um and obviously the breakage from
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
that is earmark for problem gambling
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
Services um one of the things I will be
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
seeking this legislative session is a
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
fix to that last year
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature budgeted
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
$150,000 for problem gambling Services
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
breakage exceeded that by
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
$38,000 right now our CFO is having
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
conceptions because he has an extra
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
$38,000 it doesn't know what to do with
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
it's meant to go for problem gambling
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
services but it can't because it's only
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
budgeted $150,000 and we have 188,000 to
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
send there so it'll be a request next
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
session to fix that
 
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.790 align:start position:0%
session to fix that
part

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.790 align:start position:0%
part
um

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
we go through license requirements you
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
sure um so the licensing requirements on
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
slide seven that's specific to games of
 
00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:40.839 align:start position:0%
chance and HHR only um in order to have
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
HHR you have to be a game operator
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
employer so the license requirements are
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
number one for the game operator
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
employer itself which is the game room
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
um the operator of the games
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
um these can be either and the these are
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
generally the entities um and so we
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
review The Entity itself and anyone that
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
they rely on financially for their
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
support the the next group is going to
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
be your primary and secondary game
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
operators and those requirements are
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
basically that they have to be 18 years
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
or older and they can't have a criminal
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
background that um either a felon or
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that involves um deceit or
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
theft and then you have your charitable
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
organizations um they just have to show
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility to be defined as a terrible
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
organization under the statute which is
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
you have to be registered with Secretary
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
of State for at least one year you have
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be registered with charitable trust
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
if required by law and um what's the
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
other one oh and you have to have IRS
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
tax exemption and
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
be not be on their Auto revocation list
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
you want me to go to the next sure Mr Mo
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
so just to go go through um in order to
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
be a goe you have to have a suitability
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
determination and so basically we start
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
by um the the legislature gave us the
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
authority to perform that work and then
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
we send it to the AG's office for review
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
and their um overall approval
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
approval so we begin by um we have the
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
applicants they have to fill out a
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional uh form that gives
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
us all their data and statistics and and
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
and things that we need to look at they
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
have to undergo a criminal history check
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
through the state police
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
their we do a financial review oh thank
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
you um a financial review of all their
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
financial statements um any judgments or
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
petitions that are against them in the
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
court and then we review any deny
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
denials or revocations they've had here
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
or in any other state regarding
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
gaming let me jump in so so certainly
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
that effort is compiled it takes many
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
days as you could imagine to compile
 
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
that data there's a usually a back and
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
forth between our staff as well as the
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
operator who's applying for the license
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
um and that takes in the process under
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
the law has to happen within 90 days for
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
HHR and we usually we usually take 45
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
days and the Attorney General usually
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
takes 45 days at that time so
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh it's an exhaustive process obviously
 
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
you're we're trying to dissuade or
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
dissuade wrong word stop folks from who
 
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible to have a gaming
 
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
license in any other state from having a
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
gaming license in this state
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
um and obviously after that we submit
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
our findings recommendations to the
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
attorney general for his
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
review once we get an approval from the
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
AG's office we also need to make sure
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
that the room itself is ready to operate
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll do a site visit we um review
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
all the internal control controls um all
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
of their documentation that they use in
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
the game room and we actually perform a
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
site visit we review their surveillance
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
um their how they do their their um cash
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
drops and whatnot if they're all ready
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
license on the next slide is merely just
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
a sort of a graph to show you the flow
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
revenue and describing how um it's
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
essentially the split between the
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
operator and the remainder to the state
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
Charities and the next slide is just a
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
pie chart of Revenue distribution to um
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
the state the Charities and The
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
Operators and how that has changed over
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
the last um couple of
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
years the HHR Revenue distribution
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
obviously is if three quarters of the
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
revenue is going to the operator
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the pie chart is going to be
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
operator and so on the next chart is um
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
just the overall re it was requested
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
last year the overall re last meeting
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
the overall child gambling Revenue in
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
this state for FY 23 is that pie chart
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
so it's $15 million of Gaming revenue
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
I would also submit to you that based on
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
our reading the revenue is
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
accelerating also I would note that
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
based on our fiscal note for HHR the
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
current HHR revenue is more than twice
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
what we anticipated per machine when we
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
did our estimate for revenue for the HHR
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
machines we estimated I think yeah 125
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
per machine and I think was 1 12200 or
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
1500 machines yeah, 1500 machines
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
right now the machines are running
 
00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:58.910 align:start position:0%
right now the machines are running
around

00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
$270 per machine which puts them in line
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
with the facilities in Oxford and Twin
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
profitability I think Twin Rivers is
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
running around 290 and I think Oxford I
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
think is 240 so it's between those two
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
profitability

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
profitability
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
and the next slide is essentially a
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
indication of
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
the just the the speed of growth of
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
charitable gambling after HHR begins
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
think uh the next slide is a breakdown
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
of the charity Revenue over the last
 
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.349 align:start position:0%
of the charity Revenue over the last
four

00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
years going to the the amount money
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
going to the the Charities obviously
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's increased as we've made steps to
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
increase vet limits increase facilities
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
increase obviously horse racing has a
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
that and the final slide is the state's
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
revenue for charitable gambling
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
obviously has increased we originally
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
had made an estimate that it would max
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
out around $12 million a year for the
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
state I think that's going to be
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than we anticipated
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
so um that is a lot of information in a
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
very short period of time um and so I I
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
truly appreciate you're saving your
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions till now and we'd be happy to
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have and
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
obviously this is not an exhaustive
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
study this is very top level stuff we're
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
going to be dig on this I imagine Mr
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
chairman over the next year Point by
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
Point area by area and we're happy to do
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
so so thank
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman thank you very much
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
for the presentation early on in the
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
presentation during the Bingo section
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
the highly contested and uh bingo area
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it was a loss leader is it
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
a loss leader due to market dynamics or
 
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
is it state regulations leading to it
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
being a loss leader I I would say that
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
Bingo is just not that
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
popular yeah I think it's an age thing I
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't think teenagers are lying up for
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
Bingo or 20y olds you know say 21 year
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
olds but yeah
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
yeah ch got a question um I know when we
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
did the bill we wanted to try to protect
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
the the the Charities that have been
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
around for a while yeah and we had a
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
phase in uh split was different and it
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
was going to eventually become equal the
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
new Charities because there's two
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
Charities per it's also correct they
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
cannot open the doors unless there's two
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
Chari sponsoring that not correct so on
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
HHR there are facilities HHR talking
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
about HR yeah so um how we doing with
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
that is it been a problem to do that
 
00:43:57.069 --> 00:43:57.079 align:start position:0%
split of the money
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
so so I can address that um it hasn't
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
been an issue yet we're still in the
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
period where we are grandfathering in
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
the existing Charities the Charities
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
that were there before HHR so they're
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
still getting uh a greater share of the
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
overall profits then new Charities that
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
are coming in are are are not getting an
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
equal share
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
um we are getting close to a place a
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
stabilization point where we've grown
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
the pi by two uh but we're not there yet
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and one thing that's actually
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
complicating it a little bit is that um
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
with the BET limits on uh games of
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
chance uh increasing as well that's
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
increased that number so HHR has even
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
further to catch up to sort of double
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
that number um
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
so we may get to a place here early in
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
24 where there is a slight reduction in
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
the amount that any individual charity
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
may get um because we haven't quite
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
quite doubled the pie we've come about
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're about probably at 1.7 1.8 now HHR
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
is still growing substantially but I'm
 
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:06.559 align:start position:0%
not sure if we're going to make up that
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
Gap completely by that time period okay
 
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.750 align:start position:0%
Gap completely by that time period okay
thank

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
you yes question of him Gina hi I don't
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
know if it's a question but I will say
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
with the previous legislation on HHR
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
they did the two Charities which we have
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
charity partners that benefit and I'm
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
very proud of it I was excited to get
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
too there was a little flaw in my
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
opinion in that legislation where it was
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
only for Charities that benefited in
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
20120 we closed down for 3 months in
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
2020 so I felt really bad that we had
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
some charity partners that couldn't
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
return for three months and I did not
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
want to as an operator my other side of
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
the Hat obviously I'm on boards as well
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
but as an operator I didn't feel right
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
about picking winners versus losers so
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
we opted to pair the same tier Charities
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
together the entire year so our
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
Charities actually make a little less
 
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
than they made before as we
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
expand but for us as an operator we
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
decided to make it fair have everybody
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
split everything in half especially
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
given that some of those Charities
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
didn't benefit for those three months so
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
they missed out I didn't want to miss
 
00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:22.109 align:start position:0%
they missed out I didn't want to miss
out

00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
twice well and I would also like to
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
comment a little back it's a little
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
complicated on the pie chart for
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
HHR I know it looks like the operator
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
gets all that but they take on all the
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
expense you also have to make a deal
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
with the machine manufacturers the
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
machines cost maybe 50,000 a piece or
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
you do a lease agreement and you have to
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
pay the totalizer people as well but
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
those are like private agreements so
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
they're very hard to put on a pie chart
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
well the the one thing you said though
 
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.349 align:start position:0%
well the the one thing you said though
was

00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
you made a decision to do something that
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
I thought we had in statute at the very
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
least in rules that said that we would
 
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.790 align:start position:0%
least in rules that said that we would
phase

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
phase
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
in that so that I'm a little concerned
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
about about that that we we were going
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
to phase in um the the Legacy we call
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
them the Legacy Charities versus the new
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
Charities you made a decision to make it
 
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
equal from day one where are we with
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair let me uh see if I can try
 
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
to explain exp the how that works and
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
how operator may choose to proceed as as
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
um Gate City has um the the Charities
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
are given designations or either a tier
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
one or a tier two tier one were the the
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
grandfather Charities for lack of a
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
better term so if you are running a tier
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
one and a tier 2 charity tier one gets a
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of the overall profits
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
from games of chance in HHR right um
 
00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:53.559 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism because we couldn't
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
guarantee that there would always be a
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
tier one or T tier two that you can
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
operate with Charities of the same tier
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
at that point the charity allocation
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
gets split in half so if you could have
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
two tier ones two tier twos
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
um what gate city has done and and some
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
other operators have done as well to
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
make things um more evenly distributed
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
is uh run the same tier at the same time
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
which under the rules creates that 50/50
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
so that's really the operator's decision
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
um we have that mechanism in there to
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
protect the Charities if they if they so
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
choose to run one and two together but
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
they certainly have the right and
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
legally have the ability to operate the
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
same tier at the same time if they if
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
that's what they choose
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that yes sir yeah I'm
 
00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.030 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that yes sir yeah I'm
G

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
G
 
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:50.839 align:start position:0%
to ask for maybe here a heck of a lot of
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
paper if you want or at least a access
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay maybe to a website or something we
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
can get can we have a full list of all
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
the Charities okay by operator how much
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're you know how much they're
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
getting and how much the expenses
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
are so that we can go over and kind of
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
just but by expenses do you mean the
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
expenses of the operator or the expenses
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
that the operator charges the charity
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
the the expenses that the charity is
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
paying that that's reducing that so we
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
know what the operator is charging the
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
charity we wouldn't
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we would be able yeah we give
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
that to you okay no that would be very
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah I think I think the
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee would like to see those kind
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
of numbers um that's so where we're at
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
with the dollars the real dollars yeah
 
00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.430 align:start position:0%
with the dollars the real dollars yeah
of

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
of
course

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
um Senator Senator oh thank you uh
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me Charlie with regards to the
 
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
breakage the the you know the more play
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
the greater the breakage does all of the
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
breakage go into
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
this fun to to for Char for problem
 
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
gambling because usually breakage is
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
split read the old days was always split
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
yeah there was a legislative change last
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
session where all of it goes into
 
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
problem gaming from so 100% of the
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
breakage goes for HHR for HHR yes for
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
sure So based on the play I don't know
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
what number you put in place but that
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
number is going to be exceeded
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
dramatically well yeah so when we meant
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
our estimate on breakage was based on
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
our estimate on revenue and historic
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
horse raising revenue has far exceeded
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
what we estimated so that's why there's
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
more money in breakage right it has not
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
kept at a restricted fund uh it's
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
restricted fund yeah it's it's go for
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
problem gambling and like I said it's
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
the money is exceeded what's in the fund
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
as approved by the the
 
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
budget okay thank
 
00:50:46.119 --> 00:50:48.510 align:start position:0%
budget okay thank
you

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
dick this is a question about licensing
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
and um and historic horse racing uh um I
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
understand that game operator employer
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
license is required in order to run
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing is there a an
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
additional lure or level of game
 
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
operator employer license that uh
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
qualifies uh enables a uh facility to
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
run historic horse racing and if if
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is or isn't uh is there any fee
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
associ C with that uh enhanced license
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
status or additional
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
license um thank you representative I'll
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to explain it as best I can
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
so that in order to apply for a historic
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
horse racing license you need to have a
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
game oper your employer license um and
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
there are suitability determinations
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
done at both levels um the way that um
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
the law or excuse me the rules read
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
right now the historic course tracing um
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
suitability review has many more um
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
requirements um that are put into the
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
into the rule terms of that
 
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional um so the historic
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
course tracing review is very in depth
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's in addition to it
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
supplemental to the games of chance or
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
game operator employer um suitability
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
review so it is a separate application
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
it is a separate license there is no um
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
license fee uh for a historic course
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
tracing license um there is a uh
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
potential investigation fee um and we
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
have a right to be reimbursed up to I
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
believe 50,000
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
$50,000 the uh our experience on those
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
is they they come in you know much lower
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
than that usually between 5 and $110,000
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
U but that's the only fee associated
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
with the application for the historic
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
course tracing uh
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
license there's neither a license fee
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
for the license itself nor in some
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions you pay a license fee per
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
here okay Senator l so Charlie ex Mr
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
director so again could you kind of walk
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
through gaming right so what's the
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
handle what's ggr we're going to hear
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
all these as we go through this and
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
probably giving a base Foundation some
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
members would be helpful to
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
understanding how we get to the number
 
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
that we start breaking apart into
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
operators and that kind of thing so
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you can walk through that a little
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
bit to give a little primer for
 
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.150 align:start position:0%
bit to give a little primer for
people

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
mean um if you could rephrase the
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
question you want to know how the money
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
I put a dollar down right what does that
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
what does that represent how much of the
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
how much kind of walk through what that
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
dollar looks like or the handle I know
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have the
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
handle okay I think I I think I
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
understand your question hopefully I can
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
I can do it so let's uh let's say you go
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
and uh let's use sports betting although
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's not charitable gaming but that's
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
probably that's what I'm most conversent
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
with but you put $100 on the Pats uh
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
this weekend um we would call that the
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
handle um so that's the amount of money
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
actually bet um it would not be a very
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
good BET right now based on where the
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
Patriots are playing um so I'd advise
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
against but um
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
so for
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
us we would be happy so uh when that
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
$100 uh goes uh in um let's say you bet
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
uh ma Jones to third interception um and
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
you've won right so we're going to pay
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
those winnings out um ultimately what
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking at in terms of uh the
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
accounting procedure is the money that
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
comes into the house is the handle then
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
there are prizes paid that is the
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
greatest expense that comes out um what
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
the difference between the money that
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
comes comes into the house and the
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
amount that gets paid out in prizes is
 
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
usually called gross Gaming revenue or
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue we have just to confuse
 
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
you guys you know there there's
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
different terminology that's given based
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
on different games but for the most
 
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
point part that's gross Gaming revenue
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
so as Charlie says that's the money in
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
the tail after after the day after the
 
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
prizes are paid um obviously operators
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
have expenses based on that um and they
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
have to pay whatever U Revenue share or
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
tax is associated with that they have to
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
pay the Charities out of that money um
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's the smaller pie that you
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
start slicing up in terms of taxes and
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
again that takes care of the operators's
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
overhead um and then ultimately then
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
they'll have a profit based on whatever
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
is left over at the end of that so
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully those are sort of the
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
different levels of accounting where
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
things get broken up if that Mak sense
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
sense question yeah I think you're about
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
to say what I'm about to say go ahead
 
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
can I we so we create
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh a glossery of terms that we can hand
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
out as well sort of a primer on
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
definitions we use all day every day but
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
certainly are not English to most people
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
so we can I can create that for the next
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
meeting and so if you can when we're
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
talking about it you'll know the right
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
verbage c l so we'll stick to well we
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
use just tle games again so in a given
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
night the the house will get a certain
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
amount of handle people have bought into
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
games and and do that they have their
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
winners and their losers so they have
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
all their winners they pay out those
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
winners and that comes off that handle
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
that is played that night so whatever
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
the money is that night and then from
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
that handle you have ggr the gross
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue which is basically the
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
net of what they have left over um and
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
then from that the operators can do OD
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
so they can is it a straight split at
 
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
that point or is there additional fees
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
that come out before the split it
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
depends on the game as we've outlaid
 
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
here in terms of what's retained but
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
we'll use historic RAC racing it's the
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
cleanest at the whatever's left in the
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
drawer or the the box at the end of the
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
night if it's $100 they keep 75 and pay
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
their expenses and their employees 25
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
get sent to the other side of the house
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
and that's split two ways 16 to the
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
state eight to the charity
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
um that's the split on that that's the
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
literally one more one more so again so
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
relative to let's go the table games
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
because we have this rent issue which is
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
a specific T charge to our community
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
talk out yes um so again once we get the
 
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
ggr does rent come out off the top of
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
that and then deide it or is rent charge
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
how's that work rent is charged uh so
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
rent for games of chance is a flat fee
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
um that's contracted for before the game
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
date um so that is that is up to the
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
charity and the game the game operator
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
to negotiate um it does vary from room
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
to room um but that that's a flat rate
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
now the only thing that is they they
 
00:57:59.549 --> 00:57:59.559 align:start position:0%
cannot go negative so a charity cannot
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
owe money at the end of the day so if
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
there if the rent was $500 but the
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
charity only made
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
$400 uh they can't lose that $100 the
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
worst they could do is get zeroed out
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
and in Operation game operators
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately will usually reduce rent if
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
they have a unlucky night or an unlucky
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
run um to make the Charities as whole as
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
possible so last question make sure I'm
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
clear on that so rent doesn't come off G
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
comes off the percentage the charity
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
gets and they subtract it from that
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
correct and the the folks um John and
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
Val work with confirm in each
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
Marketplace what a commercial reasonable
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
rent would be to confirm that is they
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
not being overcharge thank you wasn't
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
isn't there in statute a a maximum
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
though is it 750 or is it isn't there is
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
there a maximum there there there is no
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
maximum the what the statement in the
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
law and I'm paraphrasing somewhat is
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
that the only constraints are the fair
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
market rental value for the property for
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
any use so it's not specific to Gaming
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
use so for example if you could rent it
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
out for a wedding at $1,000 a night
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
theoretically you could charge $1,000 a
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
night for um for for gaming um I just
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
want to interject one other thing too
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about the
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
different levels of accounting here and
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's important for those who are not as
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with gaming are coming into
 
00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:29.039 align:start position:0%
this a little bit newer that handle is
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
obviously always a very large number um
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
but in reality that is not the money
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
that walks into the facility so for you
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
know again taking a if you're sitting at
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
an HHR and you're betting you know
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
you're $100 you put $100 into the
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
machine you could sit there and win and
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
lose and win and lose and win and lose
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
you may be up $20 or down $20 at the end
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the day but if you were there for a
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
couple hours betting $2 every you know
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
couple seconds your handle number may be
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
astronomical and maybe $4,000 $5,000 in
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
reality you just had that $100 that went
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
back and forth over and over again so
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's just important to keep in mind when
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
we look at handle numbers obviously that
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
has a relation to ultimately what the
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
revenue is going to be but um it's
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
important to know like if we're talking
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
about hundreds of millions of dollars in
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
handle that doesn't necessarily mean
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's hundreds of Millions ions of
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in the facility it could be the
 
01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
same dollar that moves along very you
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
know back and forth many times so
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
following up on Senator Lang's request I
 
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
think it'd be helpful to have take one
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
facility or make up a facility and do a
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
little chart that shows this much money
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
and where it goes that I think that
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful and then I want to
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
throw a little twist what about poker
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
because poker is handled a little bit
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
differently uh and a lot of lot of rooms
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
do have poker and then there's regular
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
poker and then there's tournaments so
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
can you just touch on on how that all
 
01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
works that I was
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
making go ahead poker how's it how does
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
they have a work poker game with the
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
chips have value chips have no value
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
explain the difference in you go you're
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
GNA test
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
my well I I can address the general I
 
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
the the poker Works differently in that
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
the house takes a rake of it on the top
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
so they're not as opposed to um if you
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
go to the roulette table you know it the
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
house gets paid based on the outcome of
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
the game um in poker the the house takes
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
a rake uh at as part of the game for
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
hosting the game oh raake is just
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
they're taking a a they're taking a fee
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
essentially for running the game so it's
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
not related specifically to the outcome
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
you're not play if you're playing in
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
poker you're not playing against the
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
house they're just they're they're just
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
basically taking a hosting fee for
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
running the game for having the deal
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
when is that fee taken I go and I put
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
money on the table and they give me
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
chips I'm assuming yeah so is a certain
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
certain they get certain less number of
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
chips so when does that transaction
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
happen that that the rake happens right
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
the rake happens on the so you're you're
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
actually I'm not a poker expert but I
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
believe and I could maybe ask Mr goes to
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
help us out but I think that gets taken
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
out of the pot as the action takes place
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
correct that's right so everybody throws
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
their chips in and they pull over the
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
dealer pulls over the rake which is the
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
casino's portion of but what Al so but
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
what percentage is The Rake uh it's a
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
flat fee I believe per table so I don't
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
know the exact amount but it's not high
 
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
and it's it's every Casino across the
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
country does the exact same thing
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay but then but I I I know I know uh
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
representa delandro is a poker player so
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
I think he understands this too so thank
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
you for the compliment but it's to set
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
and it's different on the tournament
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
it's a flat percentage of you know if
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
you play a tournament for $100 is 20% I
 
01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:05.559 align:start position:0%
believe for the so that's tournament
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
play tournament play yeah right but all
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you Mr chair um can you
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
go over the rent again I I'm kind of
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
confused about the fixed rate rent it's
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
a fixed rate rental fee going in and
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
there a percentage of the portion going
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh can we out after that we're mixing
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges here or well can we
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
also back up a little on the rent when
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
did we put rent in in in the statutes
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
was it always there because it used to
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
be the old days charal
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
gaming uh you know used to be in
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
somebody's in the basement of the church
 
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
and the the company would come and then
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
but then in the beginning all of the
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
Charities actually had a be there and
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
have role and even handling the money
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
and then then charl gaming and our state
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
evolved to a point I'm assuming
 
01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line we don't have
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
the Charities helping so that the
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
facility decided they were going to
 
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
charge rent is corre is that a correct
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
so is I understand it because it was
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
before my time dealing with charitable
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
gambling it was
 
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
2015 and the facilities which were
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
operating charitable gambling were
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
actually losing money and they need to
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
add rent as an additional profit Center
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
to allow the facilities to maintain
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
operations is how was explained to me so
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
that was that was the history of it
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
correct that was history that's how rent
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
was added to the law in 15 okay we get
 
01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
to now get question to answer there'd be
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
a base rent plus a percentage of the
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's where I'm confused no I I
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
apologize I probably confused you it's
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
just the base rent so if you come in
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's you would sign a contract with a
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
game operator it would be let's just say
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
for $250 a night that's what you would
 
01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
owe um so the way the cleanest way that
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
this would work is you'd make $1,000 as
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
a charity you'd have a contract for
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
250 so you would pay them their 250
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
you'd get a check for a th000 and you
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
net out
 
01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
$750 so what is the 10% of the Charity's
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
portion um is returned to the the
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
operator as rent it
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
says which and it ranges from 5 to 50%
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
by room so uh on that slide I think what
 
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
that's meant to convey is that um on
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
average based on our
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
analysis Charities end up paying about
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
10% now that is not that's not how it's
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
charged okay so I guess the the best way
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
to say it is Charities still pay on a on
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
a a fixed rate and based on our analysis
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
of the the relation between that fixed
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
rate and how much money they actually
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
get it ends up being around 10% on
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
average if that makes
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
sense okay follow follow and you also
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
said they're not allowed to lose money
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
correct so that would be less rent or or
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
the same rent correct so if there if the
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
if the amount of money if the amount of
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue that the charity was going to
 
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
get from the gaming day exceed did their
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
agreed upon rent um they'd have to
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
reduce that rent to at least make make
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
it a break even for the charity okay
 
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so I had a new charity
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
approach me a couple of weeks ago that's
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
I not going to mention the name of the
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
facility that said they F they got their
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
first check the first that
 
01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.630 align:start position:0%
first check the first that
electronically

01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
sent uh but then they got a bill in the
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
mail for rent no one talked to him about
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
rent I I think we need to we need to get
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
our hand around rent here um as part of
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
this um I I I I told them I think
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's a cap on it I was wrong it
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like there's a cap on the
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
rent and I I I think that's something
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to really address and I I
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
know it's one of our you know one of our
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
charges so but I think it would really
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
be helpful to have a a chart with an
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
example that we can you know one for
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
games a chance and one for HHR how the
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
money flows I know I know there's it's
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
totally different and then I think we
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
have an explanation now on on poker I
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
think we're okay
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
well well lucky S I had a question about
 
01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 too um so with with the Advent
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
of HHR is it is it uh to to have for the
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
terrible locations it used to be they
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
had to have Bingo running that day to do
 
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.670 align:start position:0%
had to have Bingo running that day to do
Lucky

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
Lucky
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
Sevens uh for my observation that wasn't
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
always followed but that's another
 
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.789 align:start position:0%
always followed but that's another
discussion

01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
but is is Lucky Seven in the charal
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
locations dying because of HHR I would
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
imagine they are uh because I don't are
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
they still some of these facilities
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
still have
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
Bingo and we have strictly bingo halls
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
we know those still exist we know we
 
01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
have other uh you know uh veterans
 
01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
facilities other locations that have
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
Bingo um that that do sell Lucky 7 uh
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
but is Lucky Seven in the terrible
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
gaming locations is that a dying thing
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
so for the most part yes um there are
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
still some facilities that are not have
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
not have decided not to do HHR at this
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
time that still have Lucky Seven
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
machines in games of chance facilities
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
it says assuming that they have Bingo
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
because I thought the statute said that
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
unless the statute change then no longer
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
have to have Bingo um the law was
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
changed with regard to that and Mr chair
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
just to explain a little bit about I
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
think some of the rationale behind that
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
was um we were
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
getting um very limited bingo events
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
where maybe one or two members of uh
 
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
staff or people who are walking by uh
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
were being pulled into the room to run a
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
bingo game for a few minutes so that
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
they could keep Lucky Seven machines on
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
um so at the legislature decided to
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
divorce Lucky 7 from Bingo and allow
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 to also be operated with games
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
of chance again because of HHR the
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
prevalence of that in games chance
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
facilities is definitely reduced uh but
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's not it's it's still it's still
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
present in some some locations okay
 
01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:44.030 align:start position:0%
present in some some locations okay
thank

01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
you Lang and then so again just two
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
things I want to just go back and just
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
clarify some about rent so rent comes
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
out of the 35% that the charity gets but
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
on top of any other any other gaming
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
operator gaming operator's money they
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
get rent on top of that it just NE it
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
can NE never go negative is the only
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
thing that is correct with the
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
clarification that it is a it is a flat
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
rate fee it is not it is not related by
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
percentage to the 35% that they receive
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's a flat rate fee that comes out of
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
that 35 35% is less than the rent they
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
pay nothing for rent they pay they pay
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
the lowest number for rent get nothing
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking a a snowy Wednesday night
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
when nobody decides to go out and game
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
right and so they may have a flat fee um
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
but the 35% is is less than the rent so
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
therefore they would just get zero the
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
charity would get zero dollars for that
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
night's activity correct so again I I
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
think we bring this up again in next
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
meeting if you can prce a chart that
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
shows the flow the actual example of one
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
fac not real numbers one
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
facility this is and show the various
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
steps of how the money flows for both
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.229 align:start position:0%
 
helpful

01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
right right it'd be helpful to see what
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
the range of rents are
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
and so one more fell so go back to Lucky
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
s our conversation now about Lucky Seven
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
so lucky s are now allowed in Social
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
Clubs BFW American Legions those kind of
 
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
places U moose clubs um
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
um how many LIC how many facilities are
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
those licensed by you as well do they
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
have to come in and apply for a license
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
and how many of those locations have we
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
seen an increase a reduction in those
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
locations uh that on
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's um I I'd have to look to see for
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
the actual number but it's probably
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
so well representative duet had his hand
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
up before and just go going back to
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
breakage real quick because I've been
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
kind of wondering I know the dedicated
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
fund is
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
150,000 um and looking at the trend
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
lines for uh Revenue right now obviously
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
breakage is going to be a bigger number
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
are you seeing an uptick in requests for
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
problem Gam issues are are you tracking
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
that is it something we need to correct
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislatively to make that dedicated
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
fund bigger because of that or if if
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing any change it just
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
curiosity so we have been in touch with
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
the um with the Council on um problem
 
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
gaming um who is a a private uh entity
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
that um has been associated with the
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
state for number of years uh they were
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
contracted with the state um uh most
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
recently in the last fiscal year um we
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
have not seen a significant increase
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's something that we've been looking
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
to see um there's been a pro probably a
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
slight increase in the number of calls
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
being received
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
um but it's not um it's it's it's
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
not escalating at the same level as the
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
amount of gaming is um so thus far um we
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a huge uptick in Rook quest
 
01:13:23.679 --> 01:13:25.110 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a huge uptick in Rook quest
for

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
services follow yeah yeah so to to the
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
point of U the dedicated fund being said
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
of 150 is that adequate at present is it
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
something that you know how does the
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
director supp we address I mean candidly
 
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's not enough to do it well it
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
just isn't it should be a larger fund it
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
should either be zero or significantly
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
more it's just enough to not fix a
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
problem but cause one in the sense of if
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
you should hire staff there should be
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated folks looking at this there
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
should be dedicated research looking at
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
this um one of the difficulties is if
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
you don't look for a problem you don't
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
see the problem and so there are more
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
folks that probably have an issue that
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
are being addressed currently so be Paul
 
01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
again sorry sorry Mr chair be clear
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
Lottery doesn't have staff that is
 
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
looking at specifics to problem gaming
 
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
we we deal with an outside vendor
 
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
correct so the the law created a council
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
on problem game
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
which we which is administratively tied
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
to us which has a specific meaning in
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
the law so I as you can imagine it would
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
be more than awkward if I was the head
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
of Council on problem gambling it would
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
make no sense so I'm fully in support of
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
it but certainly divested from
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
it okay represent BR had a question
 
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um for my own
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
information mostly but
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
um Lucky Seven decline is that because
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
Kino um I know no I would it would
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
likely be that folks that had Lucky
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
Seven machines have now have historic
 
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
Forest racing machines because a lot of
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
the social clubs for had Lucky Sevens
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
for years and they made quite a bit of
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
money and then all of a sudden they got
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
the Kino and now they're taking out the
 
01:15:08.639 --> 01:15:09.550 align:start position:0%
the Kino and now they're taking out the
Lucky

01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
Lucky
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
Sevens um I I have you seen that you
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
could take a look and see do some
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
analysis on that frankly we haven't at
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
this point I think the decline obviously
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
is it's relatively slight and
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I would have to say there
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
were there were a few fairly large games
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
of chance facilities that had a
 
01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
significant number of Lucky Seven
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
machines um what the one in Manchester
 
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
um that's that has um transferred to
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
Historic horse racing I think that would
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
have the most material impact on that
 
01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven number so anecdotally I
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
don't think we've seen that Kino is um
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
has has eaten into that those but um we
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
can we can do some further analysis on
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
on that and come back to you on it well
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
the interesting about Kino it's
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
different than than
 
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
U charal gaming is that a town has to
 
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
vote it in uh so not every town where
 
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
where are we with that is it about half
 
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
the towns or cities I know it's your
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
favorite topic no actually it's ironic I
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
was in Portsmouth last night oh you are
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
pitching there for the public hearing on
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
Kino uh the Portsmouth uh mayor and city
 
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
council we have 84 town nine cities and
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
one unincorporated Township that have
 
01:16:27.199 --> 01:16:28.270 align:start position:0%
one unincorporated Township that have
authorized

01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
Kino um there are a number of towns and
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
cities that or not cities number of
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
towns and unincorporated townships where
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
there would be no lensey so we didn't
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
seek approval you know of some of the
 
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
places particularly at North Country um
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so there are a few cities like
 
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
conquer for example hasn't approved it
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
Keane hasn't approved it um Portsmouth
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
has yet to approve it you know knock on
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
wood they will next election um but
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the state's
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
population is that lives in a place
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
where Kino or is bordering town that Keo
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
so my town of stratum I I got a finally
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
got somebody I'm not a former
 
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
constituent let's say called me say Pat
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
why we have Kino here and I said well
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
first step go talk to the three
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
restaurants that pour liquor in this
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
town and if if they want it then then
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
did talk to the selectman about getting
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
a warrant article but I don't think any
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
of the three restaurants really want it
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
so so why bother you know as as a
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
practical matter of the the bars and
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
taverns at cell Kino it's one in
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
five launch Keo and it's a decision by
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
the business owner whether they want or
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
not want it but some businesses fits
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
great in sports bar it does great right
 
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
um but you know if you sell if you're a
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
fine dining not going to happen so
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
Ames this is a question on historic
 
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
horse racing and the uh takeout or
 
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
commission which is in the statute at up
 
01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.030 align:start position:0%
commission which is in the statute at up
to

01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
12% um and I've puzzled over that that
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
those words up to
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
12% and uh wondered what are the what
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
are the factors that uh key into a uh
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
less than 12% um takeout and uh and what
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
in fact are you seeing in terms of take
 
01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
up um fundamentally that's a decision by
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
the operator and the floor mix of the
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
machines at any given time and it has
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
number of variables one is the player
 
01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
base that you're deriving your revenue
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
from if there's no other choice so for
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
example say there was a HHR facility in
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh there's nothing else around
 
01:18:51.629 --> 01:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
you could have a lower prize payout but
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
if you're in a area where there's four
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
or five facilities around you you have
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
to have a competitive prize pound
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
because the players will know and they
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
will know immediately and so that's
 
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a point of a variable the
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
operator will want to use competitively
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
against the other rooms nearby and
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
that's a decision you know day in day
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
out the floor mix um we joke there are
 
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
some of our facilities that they never
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
saw a hand card they didn't like so they
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
keep moving machines around constantly
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
to get the right floor mix and so um
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's what that's that's it's very much
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
a business decision on the operator on a
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
daily weekly monthly
 
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
basis follow up go set it looks like
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
on so let's see we're we're talking
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
about take out from the handle yes and
 
01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
the handle is everything bet do I have
 
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
that right no so we're talking take out
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
of the money left at the end of the
 
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.430 align:start position:0%
of the money left at the end of the
night

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
night
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
yeah no sorry we're yes we're talking
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
about Price p yes talking about handle
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
correct so in the example before where
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
there $2 $2 $2 yeah it's
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
the $2 time 10 times he did it is $20
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the that's the handle
 
01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
and then the make out from it is up to
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
12% of that do I have that right you do
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry yes you do and and that
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
number is an incredibly important part
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
gambling so just that
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
um and this is why it's very difficult
 
01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
to do an overview of everything because
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
the the accounting that we went through
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
before of you have the handle then you
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
have the prizes paid and then you have
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
the till and you start making divisions
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
out of that that is not how historic
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
horse racing operates historic hor
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
racing operates on a takeout at the top
 
01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
so the house takes the money off of the
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
top and then it's paramutual wagering so
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
the all of the prize money then goes
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
into a pool that is then competed for
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
amongst the players so the accounting of
 
01:21:07.709 --> 01:21:07.719 align:start position:0%
from our perspective for HHR is a little
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
bit flipped on its head where the money
 
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
gets taken off the top and then you
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
start talking about the prizes the prize
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
pool at that point in time yeah it's
 
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
um well I'll leave it at that I'm let
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
Senor alandro I think you G and then if
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
you think of it but if you use the per
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
perut cuds that $2 bet that you put in
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
off the top
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
comes 10 sets right off each dollar
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
correct which is uh correct all right
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
and then and then you get you get
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
returned on on your on your on your bet
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
based on the the calculation is based on
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of the body that's that's bet
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
but off the
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
top correct go correct and to uh
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
represent Ames earlier just uh question
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
about how much it actually comes in it's
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
a lot more than 12 it actually comes in
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
just slightly under 10 on average okay
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
so people should people should
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
understand that so is that is that under
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
10 consistent with other loc other
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
facilities make it too high then then
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
the payouts are going to be less and
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
then you
 
01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
I looked at M sorry I looked at Main and
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
R Island last night and it's very
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
competitive with those okay I think BR
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
Island one of the rooms has a smaller
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
has a a lower payout but I think it's
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
because it's geographically uh
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
separated someone have a question over
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
okay well I was just going to say yeah
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
Nationwide it's somewhere between 8 and
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
12% and that's what operators have found
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
is the best return to get the customers
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
back right you take 15 20% you're not
 
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
not going to get the return the players
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
aren't going to have an entertaining
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
experience so that's really kind of
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
where the nation settled in some
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions Vegas Atlantic city where
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's highly competitive and I want more
 
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
time on device for my players that's
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
going to be my competitive Advantage
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
like um like you mentioned that's when
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
you see a little bit lower but they're
 
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
still not lower than about 7% yeah I
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
mean the provision regarding 12% was
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
actually put in as a consumer protection
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
at the time it was not meant to be uh it
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
was meant to say we won't go lower than
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
this because if you have a room up in
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
Berlin for example where has no
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
competition would be unfair to have
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
those players be have a lesser product
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
yeah then there's jurisdictions where
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
there is no cap you could hold 80% if
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
you want it but all the operators are
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
still on that 8 to 12% right
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
right sen representative am again I'm
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
sorry wa representative am yeah um
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
so there are slots that are not
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
paramutual much
 
01:23:58.159 --> 01:23:59.709 align:start position:0%
paramutual much
more

01:23:59.709 --> 01:23:59.719 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
um frequent in the United States and
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
there's historic horse racing which is
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
on a paramutual basis and so
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is sort built into
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
the slot
 
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
machine uh
 
01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.830 align:start position:0%
machine uh
machine

01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
programming is essentially a takeout
 
01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
because the the payack back is not
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
100% it's less every overall there's
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
going to be a loss to those who gamble
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
with slot machines and that's in the 8
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
to 12% range that you were talking about
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
correct slot machines HHR they have
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
other class to which are based on
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
lottery um math it's all in that 8 to
 
01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
12% for if I may it's it's really a a
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
question of competition engaging the
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
market and what what you
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
can take out and and uh you won't be
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
hurt by it competitively and what you
 
01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
can't cor it's just about getting the
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
players back right if I go in and I lose
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
too much money or I don't get enough
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
time playing I'm not entertained or I
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
never win then I'm not going to get
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
those players
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
um my plan at the moment is to go to
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
11:30 does others have puring things
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
before that or or do okay CU I think
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
there's still more questions but for
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
respecting everybody's time we'll keep
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
it to two hours for today um I do have a
 
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at at the
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
commission the official commission
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
charge whether whether the state should
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
limit the number of charal gaming
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
locations right now there's no limit I
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
can come you know Senator Lang and I
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
could say we're going to we want to open
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
one of these places if we meet all the
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
characteristics of uh uh you know
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
background checks and all that we can
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
open one of these uh we don't have a we
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a restriction on the number U
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
unlik Kino we don't because I I I was
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
grilled on this when with my HHR bill
 
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
was well wanted we wanted we have a opt
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
in for the towns for historic racing I
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
was say well no this is just a form of
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
of gaming that that already exists in
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
these locations so but the question
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
comes in the future do do we want to
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
limit the number of these locations
 
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's the big issue to me to address uh
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
I know when we had our Casino bills in
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
the old days there was always one or two
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
then it was arguments why not
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
four right now we have like 12 is
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
it it's well it's 10 HHR facilities
 
01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
operating currently and there are more
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
we come online
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
Okay um but with less owners right
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
there's owners that own m multiples
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
correct correct right right but how
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
about charitable gaming itself how many
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
how many charitable gaming 14 we're at
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
14 now yeah so we had a high water mark
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
of around 16 16 right so okay so this is
 
01:27:08.669 --> 01:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
one of the big issues we got to we got
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
to address um and um and the problem for
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
me is we want more Charities involved so
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
the way to get more Charities involved
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
is to have more of these um but then as
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
we consolidate because there's some
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
consolidation going on and we're taking
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
two smaller ones and making one larger
 
01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
one and but we're limiting we're
 
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
limiting it to two Charities where the
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
where the Charities are going to get an
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
astronomical amount because they're
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
bigger bigger facilities so we have to
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
have some kind of I think in our
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
discussions uh how do we how do we
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
control that um my goal in with HHR was
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
not to hurt any of the existing
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
Charities and what they were making and
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
I think we succeeded in that um but you
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
know going forward if we wind up having
 
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
consolidation and bigger facilities I
 
01:28:02.830 --> 01:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
think we have to have we have to look at
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
what that looks like in terms of the
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
number of Charities that can participate
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
any given day uh because we're looking
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
at right now my understanding is that uh
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
for the bigger bigger Halls that we have
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
um for 10 days you can walk away with a
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
charity you can walk away with over
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
100,000 uh for basically doing nothing
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
and they love it uh and I don't blame
 
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
them um and it's it's a wonderful thing
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
for the Charities uh but it's really I
 
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
think we got to really this why I say
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
big picture because the the environment
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
is changing that we're you know the
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
whole complexion a lot of Outsiders now
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
coming in probably a lot more money
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
coming in building larger facilities and
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
um we don't have
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
any again all of our regulations and all
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
of our rules were based on smaller
 
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.510 align:start position:0%
of our rules were based on smaller
facilities

01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh that uh you know all did okay uh now
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
the world has changed and we got to I
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
think have to address that but one of my
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts was um and I know uh
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ames was very active when
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
we were looking at casino
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
casinos um you you chair the commission
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the regulations how we would
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
do that and that was that was at the
 
01:29:18.199 --> 01:29:19.189 align:start position:0%
do that and that was that was at the
heart

01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
heart
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
of all of the other uh
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh gaming bills for Casino bills that
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
came and then then those bills stopped
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
because there was no interest
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
anymore um is it do we I'm just throwing
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
this out to the commission and the
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
Charlie you too um do we want to match
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
up what representative ames's report did
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
with what our regulations are today
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
because basically the facilities we have
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
are real casinos I mean with HHR they
 
01:29:55.629 --> 01:29:55.639 align:start position:0%
are real casinos um I think I didn't
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
talk to you in advance about this but do
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
you think that would make some sense and
 
01:29:59.159 --> 01:30:04.910 align:start position:0%
you think that would make some sense and
then

01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
Charlie the
 
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh undertaking of that commission back
 
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.070 align:start position:0%
uh undertaking of that commission back
in

01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
2014 or 13 something like that
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
um was
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
the reg regulatory structure that should
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
be in place in the event that the
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
legislature decided to go forward with a
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
large casino and it was um either in the
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
either a single large facility or maybe
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
two or possibly three but a very small
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
number so big
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
Casino uh the commission's charge was
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
not to opine on
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
the should or shouldn't but if you do it
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
this would be uh the best way to do it
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
at least in the Judgment of the
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
commission and that's what we
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
developed um and in the end put forward
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh separately from the commission a bill
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
and I sponsored that that called for a
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
large Casino maybe two I don't remember
 
01:31:18.669 --> 01:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
um basically using the regulatory
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
structure and that came close but didn't
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
make it um so uh there's a lot of
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
material in there and the uh commission
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
was uh assisted in its work by a entity
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
that uh we contracted with after a
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding process uh White
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
Sands gaming something like that um and
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
they were very good I thought we all
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
thought actually and uh and so there's a
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
lot of material there that could be
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
looked at in connection with this but
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
bear in mind that
 
01:31:55.709 --> 01:31:55.719 align:start position:0%
unless there was a recommendation to
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
consolidate what's out there already
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
which would be extremely difficult and
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
go to a um a large Casino um platform if
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
you will um a lot of
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
it is for large casinos a lot of the
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
work product there is for a large Casino
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
model and we're talking
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
about probably we're talking about um a
 
01:32:21.239 --> 01:32:22.709 align:start position:0%
about probably we're talking about um a
uh

01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
a number of and that's part of our our
 
01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.990 align:start position:0%
a number of and that's part of our our
um

01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
charge how big the number is a number of
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
relatively small gaming rooms um as I
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
understand it um and so there is that
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
that starting point do we want to look
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
at the big ones uh which means
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
consolidation because it really doesn't
 
01:32:49.109 --> 01:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
a big one is going to swallow up every
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
Everything the small um probably I don't
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
know um yeah so it was the Massachusetts
 
01:32:59.709 --> 01:32:59.719 align:start position:0%
model uh that we were looking at at that
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
time okay so but there are certain
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
principles in
 
01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
that there are certain principles in
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
there whether it's a large Casino or
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
small Casino wouldn't you say I mean of
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
I I was just I'm thinking out loud here
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
that that possibly we could match that
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
up with what the regulations we have is
 
01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
there something that we're missing that
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
we need to have
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh because I know I wish Senator dandre
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
was still here um um I know that's one
 
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
of his big things you know is is is the
 
01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.790 align:start position:0%
of his big things you know is is is the
regulations

01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
proper now last term we had a joint
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee with the Senate where we tour
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
these the you were on it we tore a bunch
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
of these facilities and from our from
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
our standpoint things looked pretty good
 
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
you know we looked at we saw the cameras
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
we saw the the room The Counting
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
Room um and and all the other things
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
that are are going on um I'm just saying
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
is there a way that we could we could
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the work that you had
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
done to match it up with the regulations
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
that we have now is there something that
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
else that we need to do um and Lou I
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
said um I was s i was suggesting that
 
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
possibly we take the the report that was
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
done that was shared by commission that
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
was chaired by representative Ames and
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
match it up to our regulations now but
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative Ames feels that well that
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
was really for a large large Casino
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be relevant um but I thought
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
maybe there are certain aspects of that
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
that maybe we could learn from that's
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
all I think Abes represent Abes is
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
correct that was for LGE facility that's
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
what we looked at that's all that's all
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
the information we gathered but
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
certainly there are a few things that
 
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
that we could we could take uh would
 
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
help us here uh but indeed he's exactly
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
right that was for a large facility and
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's where we spent all of our time at
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
that at that point in time but it seems
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
to be we're we're growing into lar of
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
facilities here that was my point and I
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
think that's that's where the the
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
interface of of the Synergy takes place
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
because we have uh if if you look at the
 
01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
television we have live casino here in
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
beer that offer
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
everything so so some of it could be
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate you know it's funny how the
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
market works you know if I was a big
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
Casino guy I look at at New Hampshire
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
and say well wait a minute this is wide
 
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
open there's no there's no limit on
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
number of casinos but am I going to be
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
competing with 14 other 15 other
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
locations uh maybe I'm not going to
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
build a bigger place here um but then
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
again it's wide open they could build a
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
bigger place if they wanted to take the
 
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.750 align:start position:0%
bigger place if they wanted to take the
risk

01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
so uh again we got plenty of time to
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
talk about these things and the
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
landscape has changed dramatically since
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
since our last right since our last
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank thank you so so I guess I'm think
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
talking about this consolidation thing
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
you you were commenting on and I think
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
we have a consolidation of ownership
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
right so we have some ownership
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
consolidation going on where have one
 
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
person or one business managing multiple
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
um versus the mom and pop we talked
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
about where we had one person managing
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
one facility um but to my knowledge we
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a consolidation where
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
someone's walked in and said we're going
 
01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
to close these three down and focus on
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
this one that hasn't been um what's
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
going on within the state while while
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
they're buying multiple ones they're not
 
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
consolidating into a single giant
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
facility as far as I know how about n
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
what's that actually happened in Kean
 
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
there were two facilities that merged
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
into one but other than that you are
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
correct Senter right and how many do how
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
many do we have in nsha do we have three
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
three yes two eligible for HHR but now
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
correct I don't know what you know I
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
know what what we know about the plans
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
in naswa for the expansion down by the
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
mall well they're going to the Pres more
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
we don't no as as the regulator we have
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
not been approached with the plan okay
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
with so is a practical matter when it
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
comes to these we're the last stop on
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
the line you have to go to the town
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
first before you can visit before you
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
you have to go to town approval before
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
you can apply with us so right follow so
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
so so again I just want to clarify the
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
consolidation necessarily someone's
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
buying up 14 casinos going to turn into
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
one giant Casino in New Hampshire that's
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
not what's happening in the industry
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
right now as far as I know um and then
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
SEC secondly just to remind everybody we
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
currently have a moratorium right so out
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
of the 14 gaming licenses that's the
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
maximum number of HHR license we can
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
have in this state that expires 24 June
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
end of June 24 if I'm not mistaken where
 
01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
I won at 24 that moratorium goes away
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
and again anybody who applied for a
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
gaming license would be eligible to add
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
the modifier of having HHR as well um so
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's currently a little bit of
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
constraint on the market um if you will
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
um and lastly I just remind what what
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
executive director uh McIntyre said was
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
that the one casino and in um Twin
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
Rivers 3500 gaming machines in one
 
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
facility we have roughly 1,600 spread
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
out amongst 10 facilities so there is
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
some Market space and Market Gap that's
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
happening again to deal with I'm
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
assuming travel plans right uh for
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
people yeah and most of the the
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
facilities are concentrated as you can
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
imagine On the Border um there's not a
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
lot of interest north of State conquered
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
U most of the facilities are within sort
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
of that magic 1H hour drive of the mass
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
border again but but again it's
 
01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
unconstrained right now um we're talking
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
the future now not what's happening now
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
could a big Casino could move in if they
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to with all the amenities if they
 
01:39:06.589 --> 01:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to take the risk uh there's
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
nothing stopping them right where when
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
we talk used to talk about casinos it
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
was always limiting the number to to a
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
three but I I I like it the way it is
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
now myself I like it spread out the way
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
it is uh because we're helping Charities
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the throughout the state as
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
best we can um and but but it's up to us
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
as at the end product of this to address
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
that issue and we have to address what
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
do we want this to look like um least
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
Senor I I I if if I understand the world
 
01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:44.199 align:start position:0%
of of G right now there are there are
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
three proposals for large facilities one
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
in Rochester at the Lilac ball one in
 
01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.669 align:start position:0%
in Rochester at the Lilac ball one in
CER

01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
CER
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
right and there's a proposal before the
 
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
pleading Board of con for a rather large
 
01:39:58.510 --> 01:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
facility and there's uh there's the
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
situation in nashaa where they would
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
like to move from one area to to the
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
shopping center which uh represents in
 
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
terms of square footage an enormous
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
growth uh growth pattern so I I I think
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh what's ha what I see happening here
 
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
think this is the issue that that we all
 
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
have to be cognizant of is is the
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
enormous expansion of of an existing
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
venue and and now you've got to talk
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
talk about the the number of Charities
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
that are going to be there the amount of
 
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
money that's raised there uh when
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing comes there but
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
when you when you talk
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
about 100,000 square fet now that's not
 
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
the church
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
basement to the best of my knowledge and
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
then you know it isn't father father
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
Mone getting up and say team number two
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
will conduct the games on Tuesday night
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
those those days are going forever and
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh I I I think that's the thing we we
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
have to be cognizant of both the
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
Charities and in us as as Regulators
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
because if you get that kind of of
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
expansion it's going to require
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
certainly more surveillance on on on
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
part of of the entity the Lottery
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
Commission and there'll be more there'll
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
be more activity but that seems to be in
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
play as we speak and um we can't limit
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
advertising and marketing is a is a good
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
strategy but we we're seeing television
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
advertising that's advertising casinos
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh I I think that's
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
something we have never seen before
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
we're adver advertising casinos in New
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
that gives people an opinion that we
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
have full range GBL uh you know in in
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
new G and I those are the things that we
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
should be cognizant of that our
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee should be should be looking at
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
you know thank you Mr this is a small
 
01:41:59.790 --> 01:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
thing but and thinking about this last
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
night I don't think in our statutes we
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
do we do we have the term
 
01:42:07.589 --> 01:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
Casino no it's it's one of the sticking
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
point so as you can imagine a number of
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
cities and towns have asked us to go
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
visit them because of this very topic
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I they asked me to Define casino and
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
I said it's not defined because it's not
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
in the in the law the law calls these
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
charitable Gaming facilities and so do I
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know we're in the executive branch
 
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
we don't get the right laws and makeup
 
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
words so no no it doesn't it there's a
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
law related to a casino or House of
 
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.149 align:start position:0%
law related to a casino or House of
ill-repute

01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
ill-repute
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
being but other than that there's
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the laws they're defined
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
certainly historic horse racing you
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
didn't know that was part of your job
 
01:42:43.709 --> 01:42:43.719 align:start position:0%
you didn't know that was part of your
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
job to regate my wife would suggest that
 
01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.629 align:start position:0%
job to regate my wife would suggest that
yeah

01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
yeah well that that just dawn on me last
 
01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.589 align:start position:0%
yeah well that that just dawn on me last
night

01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
night
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
because most of these facilities are
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
calling themselves casinos now and
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
technically well is that it's not
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
violating a law I don't think but it's
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
but it's it's these facilities called
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
themselves casinos before they were HHR
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
for authorized right they did like I
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
mean you know you could call yourself a
 
01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
beastro a cafe a restaurant I don't know
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
what it is it's just it's a gaming
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
facility and so well I think it's a
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
small thing but I think I think casinos
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
are here so I think I think the
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
legislature should at least Define it in
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
the statutes that's something that could
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
be in the report that we could suggest
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
to the legislature to do and also I
 
01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
could suggest Mr chair I'm not in that
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
seat but if I can ask a question yeah if
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
we could also um re review a fee or a
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
cost of doing business to communities
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
that actually host these it would
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
certainly go a long way to those
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
communities of the number I have visited
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
and has been a bunch it has been number
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
one on their topic is
 
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
I expect increased services in my
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
community for this activity can we get
 
01:44:00.189 --> 01:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
money from the state for to reimburse us
 
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
essentially for this and so like the
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
casino Bill representative Ames and I
 
01:44:06.510 --> 01:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
worked on a number of years ago included
 
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
a essentially a mitigation fund for the
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
local community to be to host this
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
facility I think that makes a lot of
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
sense with care right I know it's in the
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
it's in our charge but I just want to
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
bring it up again okay I I agree with
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
that that's that's good because again
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're looking at everything
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
I you can't get away with not looking at
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
it all and say it's grown it's growing
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
what do we want it to look like that's a
 
01:44:32.589 --> 01:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
good point when we used to do the casino
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
bills that was always a point of issue
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
the town you know was always Rockingham
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
Park was always the Rockingham Park was
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
the location it was the ideal location
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
they all had plans for for Rockingham
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
Park uh location that's gone now um but
 
01:44:47.679 --> 01:44:48.310 align:start position:0%
Park uh location that's gone now um but
I

01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
remember there was there was provision
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
in there to to help the Sal them out
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
with the the traffic issues and
 
01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.270 align:start position:0%
with the the traffic issues and
everything

01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
else in in that legislation there were
 
01:45:04.109 --> 01:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
Provisions for the for the for the codes
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
and for for the locals uh with regard to
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
sharing of revenues but also the law
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement the ability of the locals to
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh to take to out their share but also
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
to participate yeah and and these kinds
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
of things are going to are going to pop
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
up pop up in my opinion because of the
 
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
size of the entities I mean the entities
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
are growing in physical space and and I
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
think that's something that we have to
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
think about uh call look at when when
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
the public in the marketing sees Casino
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
they expect something there's an
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
expectation there and it isn't it isn't
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
the expectation for charitable gabing
 
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's an expectation for a casino and
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's how that's how they are now being
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
marketed as casinos that
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
requires a certain amount of of scrutiny
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
on the part of of the locals because the
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
locals are being called to service the
 
01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.390 align:start position:0%
locals are being called to service the
parking

01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
parking
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
lots uh and I know in Manchester that
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
has been a concern to our police force
 
01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
what's happened in those in those
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
parking lots uh Abate Behavior Uh the
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
stealing of of vehicles at I so sure
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
that there's there's there's a certain
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's a certain amount of cost
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
associated with this that's got to be
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
absorbed by somebody because somebody's
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to pay
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
it so well this want to follow them Tim
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we took the tours we did ask
 
01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
the question about security most of most
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
of the facilities had Security in inside
 
01:46:37.870 --> 01:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
Security on their own um I can't recall
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
if that's in the statute that they had
 
01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
to have security but most did have
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
security it's it's a regulatory
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
requirement for the historic coring
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
facilities to have a security plan that
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
we uh so we don't we don't dictate
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what that needs to be but they
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
need to demonstrate to us so his
 
01:46:59.629 --> 01:46:59.639 align:start position:0%
facilities with HHR machines correct
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay we do not have a similar rule or
 
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
statute um with respect to games of
 
01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
chance gener right right again this is
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
something that we should be addressing
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
as as we go along Tim than
 
01:47:19.629 --> 01:47:19.639 align:start position:0%
so in simcast racing right again a
 
01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
different form of gaming that goes on
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
but s cast racing that goes on um I know
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
the brook I'm not sure I should say
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
their name but they they pay C Brook a
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
fee for operating simoc cast are tune
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
about $225,000 a year the town gets for
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
allowing that activity so again maybe we
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
can bring the language in that looks
 
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
where that comes from and what that fee
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
looks like and maybe there's a place for
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
that kind of similar language in futral
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
isolation I mean yeah there's no
 
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
question there certainly regarding the
 
01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
percentage that is
 
01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:52.270 align:start position:0%
percentage that is
the

01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
25% that can be looked at in terms of
 
01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
who gets what I the budgeted amount for
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
the state we will well exceed that and
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
so there's more money as well as other
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
funds available the the profitability of
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
this is more than double what it was
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be and that's only going
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
to accelerate as facilities come online
 
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
in nashwa and otherwise there will
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
be significant sums of money generated
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
by this activity that could be sent to
 
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns follow yeah so
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
again I'm not saying where the
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
percentage comes from what happens or
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
anything else it just seems like we
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
already have a mechanism in law when it
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
comes to gaming for Revenue sharing with
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
communities we probably try to should
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
try to stay consistent in that model um
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe so we should probably look at
 
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
what that looks like and see how we can
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
do that I also think it should be relate
 
01:48:44.910 --> 01:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
to the amount of activity in the city or
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
town so like Nash would get more than
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
Lebanon just because of the activ
 
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
involved and how much it would be
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
so again I just want to stay consistent
 
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
right so I'm not sure how that historic
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
how that uh Sim Gast racing model Works
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
to give to the municipality and what
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
what mechanism in law does
 
01:49:08.189 --> 01:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
that it's not through us so that's them
 
01:49:10.109 --> 01:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
them on their own are choosing to do
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
that I think so we'll check them thank
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
you you'll set there you have your light
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
on I was thought thought you were going
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
to no it's okay so um any other
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions from anyone I do have a
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
question represent Jan again yes so I
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
was just looking at the um the second to
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
last page the charity Revenue fouryear
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
comparison and
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
um you said Bingo is a lost leader so I
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
can see there's negative amounts for
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
each year there so I'm assuming the
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
revenue in each column there is that a
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
expenses yes
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay so the the Charities have they've
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
paid the
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
rent and then then they've also
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
subtracted whatever um wages they've
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
paid or other expenses they've incurred
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
and then this is the
 
01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:08.310 align:start position:0%
and then this is the
net

01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
net
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions for
 
01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
today seeing them so let's let's uh talk
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
about the next meeting so the F oh is
 
01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
another one oh representative Ames I
 
01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.070 align:start position:0%
another one oh representative Ames I
think

01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
um there there is a question that needs
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
to be thought about maybe we should talk
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
about it next time it's up to you but uh
 
01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
$150,000 is $150 yeah ,000 allocated to
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
the work of this commission and the
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
question obvious question is how can we
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
best make use of that and uh you know
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're getting going and I in we're
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
starting into a time period we're
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
starting late cons because of various
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
things that have happened and here we
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
are uh we're going to run out of time in
 
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
the meantime if we're going to get
 
01:51:06.589 --> 01:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
expert help if that's what the money is
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to be spent on we need to figure
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
that out and figure out what we want
 
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
that help to focus on um the one example
 
01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh which I may be a poor example but
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's we talked about uh the bill that I
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
worked on years ago and the uh report of
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
that commission we could have uh we
 
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
could certainly use help I'm not going
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
to do it uh going
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
through um
 
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
that work product and identifying parts
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
of it that should be that might be
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to the work of this commission
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know that kind of thing well it's
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's funny you say that because that's
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
why that's where I was going with that
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh but it didn't seem like there was
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
that much excitement about doing it but
 
01:51:52.109 --> 01:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
I was thinking of using an outsider to
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
to go through that but probably you know
 
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
we have to go out to bid I would imagine
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
to have somebody help us with that and
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
then match it up with our regulations
 
01:52:04.069 --> 01:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
here um and um using a white sand kind
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
of white sand like it was white Sand's
 
01:52:09.149 --> 01:52:09.159 align:start position:0%
kind of firm uh to do that um because
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
that that's the area I thought we would
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
need help on because none of us have the
 
01:52:16.109 --> 01:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
time to do that or the expertise to do
 
01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
that Senator because cedo charitable
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
gaming has grown across the country I
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
mean we think of it as as New Hampshire
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
but Delaware had to put charitable
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
gabing in they were the first state to
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
have casinos at the tracks and that was
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
a model that we used in the past but
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
they've been they've been forced to have
 
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming so charitable gaming
 
01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
is there and we we ought to be able to
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
examine what it's what's happened around
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
around the country with regard to this
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
because it it's in my opinion
 
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's becoming very very large very large
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that maybe 10 years from
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
now that that might occupy the greatest
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
portion of the of the activity by by the
 
01:53:04.679 --> 01:53:08.550 align:start position:0%
portion of the of the activity by by the
lottery

01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
commissions when when uh was there a bit
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
process to get get them in I don't know
 
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
how the state I would imagine there's
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
a yeah so it's um Whit New Jersey and
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
there's a number of companies that do
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
this like Spectrum comes to mind they're
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
also out of New Jersey um there are a
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
number of Consultants that could do this
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
type of stuff
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the recommendations of the
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
wh Sands report we've tried to
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate into our operations because
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
if you're doing a if you're gambling in
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
the state you should have the comfort
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
that it's being regulated well and
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
regardless of what you call it we should
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
do it correctly and so we've tried to
 
01:53:52.350 --> 01:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into our operations so
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
that I I can tell you with a certainty
 
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
approaching death and taxes we're
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
nowhere near as bad as it was in 15 when
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
we did this we did that report in terms
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
of regulations I mean obviously we can
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
make improvements but it's done much
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
much better now so so you know the
 
01:54:07.229 --> 01:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
companies who this kind of work is what
 
01:54:07.239 --> 01:54:08.030 align:start position:0%
companies who this kind of work is what
I'm

01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
hearing not companies but there are
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
companies that do this yes there are
 
01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
Consultants that do um this and I mean I
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
certainly can generate a list pretty
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
quickly okay um for the next and if we
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
want to go to bid it's not that terribly
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
hard to do certainly we had number of
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
when I was on a study commission back in
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
2011 we had Consultants come in then and
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
I know a number of them is still there
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
Lou and I were on that one together
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
remember yeah
 
01:54:34.159 --> 01:54:37.229 align:start position:0%
remember yeah
yeah

01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
so certainly and there's a budget and
 
01:54:41.790 --> 01:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
the budget I'm sorry I didn't address
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
this earlier but the the budget I
 
01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
forwarded around was one administrative
 
01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:47.719 align:start position:0%
Services required us to generate a
 
01:54:50.109 --> 01:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
Budget prior to us meeting the the last
 
01:54:51.629 --> 01:54:51.639 align:start position:0%
time so I had to submit something
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
Bradman Services which can be amended if
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
the body sees fit that that's just a a
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
placeholder essentially for a
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
budget yes uh what what I would
 
01:55:04.069 --> 01:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
recommend and I've seen in other
 
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions is to get the list there's
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
probably two to four of these very
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
reputable um organizations have worked
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
for other states have them come in to
 
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
either the next meeting allocate 10
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
minutes each let them pitch and then
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
when we find the scope send that out and
 
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
let them come back with their
 
01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:25.719 align:start position:0%
number is we could even arrange that
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
remotely if they wanted to pitch sort of
 
01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
via tombs or zom uh Zoom or
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
teams Charlie I I'll I'll I'll reach out
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
to you we we'll coordinate okay thanks
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for that idea so uh and again
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
eventually we have to do an RFP of some
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
kind correct yeah and actually I oddly
 
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
might have the draft of the one we did
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
so um there's also I've talked to
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
Charlie about this before nickel G's
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
which is the National Council of
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
legislators from gaming states which
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
will provide us an incredible amount of
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
research I think it's like a $2,500
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
membership year annually for the state
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
or something like that but they'll open
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
up their all of their white papers to us
 
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
include responsible gaming
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
conversations um you know uh financials
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
for lot for gambling that's going on
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
across multiple States so I'd consider
 
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
joining an organization like that that
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
could provide us just simple white
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
papers that we can read and understand
 
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
without necessarily I as in addition to
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
whatever else we choose to do but okay
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
do you belong to any of those do you you
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
must get stuff you must get in fact
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
actually to senator's point I get asked
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
every year am I going to Nickel G's this
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
year and I always say no we're not
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
members and like we keep adding more to
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
the pile and so we're the number one
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
sports bet state in the country in terms
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
of per capita next number two sorry
 
01:56:52.109 --> 01:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
you're number one we're three now damn
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
it so we're a very prevalent sports
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
betting uh state so we get asked
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
frequently to be on panels in nichel G's
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
and I have to say I'm sorry I'm not
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
going so yeah so just to be full
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
disclosure I have been on their panels
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
before I discuss discuss gaming gaming
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislation what New Hampshire's doing
 
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
how it's going um I find it to be an
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
incredibly useful tool to find out
 
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on in other states how
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
they're regulating things what their
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
financial models look like um there's
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
been some inredible again I've got two
 
01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
or three of their events um it's an
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
incredible conversation so you suggest
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
and they charge a fee for disinformation
 
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
yeah well no if we're a member we would
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
get it as part what I'm saying so for a
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
simple flat fee we could probably get
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
access to lots of white papers and
 
01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
conversation points that are available
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
only to the members of nickel G's
 
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
without having to necess probably not a
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
bad way to spend the
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
money it sounds like well so the
 
01:57:46.109 --> 01:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
commission I'll pay for you to get that
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
certainly we belong to a number of
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
associations as well and sort of
 
01:57:52.069 --> 01:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
get the benefits of this membership just
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
because of shared knowledge of our
 
01:57:55.229 --> 01:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
industry yeah what kind of dudes we
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
talking about or I think it's like 2500
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
bucks a year five maybe five grand a
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
year at most okay all
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
right all right so let's let's talk
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
about the next meeting so I think I
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
think we continue on this thing I'll
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
talk to Charlie to see if we can um I'm
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
going to kind of got it you know from a
 
01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
company I guess they prefer to have the
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
RFP in front of them before they come
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
and and and make a
 
01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
presentation because we have to be kind
 
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
of specific as to what we're looking for
 
01:58:27.629 --> 01:58:27.639 align:start position:0%
and then we can have a preliminary
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
invite them to our next meeting and they
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
can tell us who they are but they're not
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to probably they can say these are
 
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
the service we
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
offer um so um but that plus having I
 
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
think Charlie U um kind of a there a a
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
lot to do with the split of the money
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
and split of the money is something that
 
01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
we need to really understand how that
 
01:58:52.109 --> 01:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
works having that sample of how that
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
works for each of the CATE you know the
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
two major categories can I also
 
01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
recommend that we present an analysis of
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
gaming across New England because it's
 
01:59:04.109 --> 01:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
the most comparator area we do this in
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
terms of the the revenue split the size
 
01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
of the area because it will all impact
 
01:59:13.629 --> 01:59:13.639 align:start position:0%
on how we go forward um the market is
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
the market if you look back 20 years
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
casinos didn't exist essentially in New
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
England other than the tribes in concut
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
and now it's a much much more mature
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
market and so okay what we do going
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
forward should have an like we don't do
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
this in a bubble New England is a very
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
small area and so I was going to suggest
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
we do that as well okay okay that's
 
01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
great and then don't forget the uh ahead
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
just concur in that I think that's very
 
01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
important and uh I think it's important
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
that it be done in a way
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
that can relate
 
01:59:48.239 --> 01:59:49.750 align:start position:0%
that can relate
Massachusetts

01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
slots facility to char Gaming facilities
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
here with HHR and the different ways in
 
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
which we um require the revenue that's
 
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
produced is distributed compared to and
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
then there's the uh licensing fee which
 
02:00:10.589 --> 02:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts is multiple thousands
 
02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
um you know for the slots it's maybe
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
25,000 and then the big one is much
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
the it's million so uh wi and
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
Springfield was $85 million license fee
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
and plain Ridge was 25 million license
 
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
fee 25 and they pay every year a $600
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
license fee per machine yeah so so that
 
02:00:33.629 --> 02:00:33.639 align:start position:0%
would be great uh really important and
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
also to that end I did um make a point
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
of printing out the uh tracker study for
 
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
the American gaming Association which
 
02:00:42.189 --> 02:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
tracks Revenue across the country by
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so I have a copy for
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
everybody I didn't want to pass it out
 
02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
because Senator Lang looked at me like I
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
had three heads when I brought a stack
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
of paperwork and I was afraid of getting
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
shot so um I have that as well if you
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
want to grab a copy it goes by
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction by jurisdiction why don't
 
02:00:56.669 --> 02:00:56.679 align:start position:0%
we why don't we hold the next meeting
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
you can hand okay all right I'll hold it
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
then okay last thing part of the next
 
02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
minute yeah RSA 284 colon 23 is where
 
02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:05.719 align:start position:0%
that Municipal language comes from it is
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
28423

02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll work with Charlie we'll
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
finalize all the things for the agenda
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
that Charlie will be doing uh and we'll
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
make a decision whether we want to bring
 
02:01:33.629 --> 02:01:33.639 align:start position:0%
these companies in yeah
 
02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so um so when so let's work
 
02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
backwards we have to have our work done
 
02:01:43.709 --> 02:01:43.719 align:start position:0%
by November 1st of
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
20124 that's 12 months um I I I don't
 
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
think meeting once a month is
 
02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.390 align:start position:0%
think meeting once a month is
enough

02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh every other week may be a little too
 
02:01:58.589 --> 02:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
much I'm I'm thinking about maybe every
 
02:02:01.149 --> 02:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
third week uh what's going to happen
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
though once we hit June the legislators
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
around the table are going to start
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
worrying about running for office
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
again uh and but we do have
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
until you know November 1st plus we have
 
02:02:19.149 --> 02:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
to have some time to write a report so
 
02:02:19.159 --> 02:02:21.270 align:start position:0%
to have some time to write a report so
so

02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking of starting
 
02:02:27.629 --> 02:02:27.639 align:start position:0%
with um every third week um I'm willing
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
to do every other week uh but I'm just
 
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
looking for everybody's sense of of that
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
I um Mr chairman the third week would be
 
02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
November 7th and that's election day
 
02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
yeah doesn't necessar have to be a
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
Tuesday either okay and then the fourth
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
week is the
 
02:02:50.109 --> 02:02:50.119 align:start position:0%
14th no well I I was thinking the week
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
of the sixth
 
02:02:54.910 --> 02:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess it would be better to have a
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
standard day that we do this on uh I
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
know it's election day that day so the
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
legislators have to be cover Bo You Know
 
02:03:15.069 --> 02:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.079 --> 02:03:17.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:03:17.229 --> 02:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%

02:03:21.550 --> 02:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
session and but which brings us to let's
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%

02:03:23.239 --> 02:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
