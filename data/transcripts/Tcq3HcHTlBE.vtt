chairman hunt

and and esteemed colleagues
 
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
well this bill i'm sure is very
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
unpopular but i i put it in not only
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
because i've
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
been president of our association at uh
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
in rochester
 
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
at least two terms
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
and i've been on uh our condo uh
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
association committee the board of
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
directors for decades i am no longer on
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
the condo association board of directors
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
uh however i do keep my finger on the
 
00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:40.950 align:start position:0%
uh however i do keep my finger on the
pulse

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
pulse
 
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.350 align:start position:0%
and we
[Music]

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
all of the complaints that i've gotten
 
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
in my email
 
00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
but the purpose for this was that this
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
last time that we had an increase in our
 
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
condominium fees
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
it was quite a jump
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
association members were angry
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so we talked about it
 
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
and they said well we just voted a
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
majority of us a pretty good majority of
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
us just voted
 
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.310 align:start position:0%
us just voted
to

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
stop this fee from going in
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
why didn't that work and i said because
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
you need two-thirds and so out of 60
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
units which is the size of the
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
condominium association that i'm a
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
member of and i've owned two condos and
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
i've been there since 1995. so i don't
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
even want to count how many years that
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
is it makes me feel old
 
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
is it makes me feel old
so

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
i said all right let's try for a simple
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
majority which would be 50
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
plus one
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
and at that point
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
the association members would have been
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
able to reject the decision of the board
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
of directors
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
and i know that that makes everyone very
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
nervous because now the association
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
owners and members actually have a say
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
instead of letting the board
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
have the say
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
and i understand representative boards
 
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
so it's it's there's a lot of tension
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to put this in because they
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a say i did not touch the
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
two-thirds for any other decisions to be
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
made we just carved out the the fees and
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
that was going to be it
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
and if this doesn't work we'll i'll just
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
work on the 40 members that will need to
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
override the board of directors next
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
time because we got really close
 
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.110 align:start position:0%
time because we got really close
but

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
they were they were angry i was kind of
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
upset too because of the jump in the
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
fees it was huge
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's why that's why i've
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
i've submitted this uh piece of
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
legislation in hopes that it will pass
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
but i know that it won't thank you very
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions from
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
the committee members yes representative
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much when you refer to as
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
condominium fees are you talking simply
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
about the monthly fees nothing else no
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
assessment assessment trash base
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
anything of that sort
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you for the question
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's that is correct so none of
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
the other decisions by the board would
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
be affected by this they still remain at
 
00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.270 align:start position:0%
be affected by this they still remain at
two-thirds

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
it really is oh and um
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
i did get a call from
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
a banker or bankers that were concerned
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
about the condominiums being able to the
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
associations being able to procure loans
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
in case that there's a need for it which
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
we've had several situations where we've
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
had to get loans for the association
 
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.309 align:start position:0%
had to get loans for the association
and

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
when i took out
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
or added in i can't remember which one
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.230 align:start position:0%
it was
but

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
special assessments weren't touched
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
either so that made them happy and
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
they're they're like fine we see no
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
problem with this so really if if you
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
have a roof problem or you need to do a
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
siding or something happens we actually
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
had a section of our our condos are not
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
stacked we have
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
sections of condos and so there was one
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
section that actually
 
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
section that actually
burned

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
burned
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
terribly and the whole that whole thing
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
had to be rebuilt they those members of
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
the association were were displaced and
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
had to live in a hotel for months
 
00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.469 align:start position:0%
had to live in a hotel for months
um

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
but they we did rebuild so at that point
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
we needed to to get a loan for some uh
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
important things and we were able i i
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
just know that being on the board being
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
president of the board and having
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that i had formed in the
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
whole nine yards that
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
we were doing just fine with maybe
 
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.909 align:start position:0%
we were doing just fine with maybe
incremental

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
condominium fee increases
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
before the two-thirds law went in
 
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.230 align:start position:0%
before the two-thirds law went in
and

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
special assessments were you know nobody
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
likes a special assessment really i mean
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know how long do we have to put up
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
but we the special assessments worked
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
just fine and then when they
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
peel off then then you're back down to
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
a reasonable level instead of having to
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
maybe you know
 
00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.630 align:start position:0%
maybe you know
supplement

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
supplement
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
in in cases where there may be a tree
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
that goes through a roof or something
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
like that so sorry to have such a long
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
answer thank you for the question
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question which is um i was
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if you've spoken to other
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who may um feel that this
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
is this is problematic beyond your own
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
condo association
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
i i have had
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
some conversations with them and i do
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
understand some of the problems that
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
arise as far as
 
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.389 align:start position:0%
arise as far as
the

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
lack of involvement
 
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
lack of involvement
of

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
and i understand this i understand the
 
00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.710 align:start position:0%
and i understand this i understand the
whole

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
i've been there
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
and and so the reason why i have
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill is because we we
 
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.790 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill is because we we
were

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
wanting to turn it into a simple
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
majority but i know that it does raise
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
some problems but then you also have
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
you know i read one email where
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
from from actually a friend someone i
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
went to school with
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
in laconia
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
and he said well by having the
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
two-thirds put in place and into law
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
that prevents
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
the association members from being able
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
to override the board and i just thought
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
to myself good lord so by putting the
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
two-thirds in you completely take the
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
voice away from the members
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
and unless you really push it which i'm
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
able to do because i'm really pushy
 
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
able to do because i'm really pushy
but

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
but yeah i do i i understand both sides
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
but i i'm hoping for for a sorry
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up please further question may
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
inquire so i i believe i've text for
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
protect um if i'm wrong let me know
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
isn't there a statewide
 
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.110 align:start position:0%
isn't there a statewide
association

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
that represent condos and if so have you
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
they don't like it
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's a short that's the short and
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
sweet answer to that one
 
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.630 align:start position:0%
sweet answer to that one
yeah

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
needless to say uh you have no other
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
supporters for this bill i mean i got a
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
whole pile of
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
pile of people who are opposed to it so
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
um and this committee has
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
not only did it pass it and we've had
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
this issue try to repeal it and revisit
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
it several times so we're we all pretty
 
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.230 align:start position:0%
it several times so we're we all pretty
well

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
but i i i want to take this opportunity
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that some of my
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts and arguments are still true so
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
you are a board member
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
did you say
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
i was i am not currently a board member
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
on the association board of directors i
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
have been president
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
two terms and then you know other terms
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
i've just been on so so when this big
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
raise came you were not on the board at
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
the time no no okay
 
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
the time no no okay
uh

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
i assume that the board made a big
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
presentation about why the increase was
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
well there wasn't much of an explanation
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't there those of us who
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
disagreed with it uh voiced our opinions
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we our board is is uh doesn't like
 
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.870 align:start position:0%
and we our board is is uh doesn't like
to

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
communicate very well
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
so there was not a whole lot of of back
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
and forth it was just a kind of a shut
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
up type of a deal ouch okay so um
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
and and we have heard this
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
before that boards are are maybe
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
aloof or elitist in some way but i was
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
intrigued by the idea that you were
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
actually on the board for a while said
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
so which of course this was never a
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
problem when you were on the board right
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know yeah so so the question then is
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.590 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
probably

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
because we would think that one of the
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
resolutions of this problem would be
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
that maybe the board needs to be
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
replaced with people who are more
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
communicative to the condo owners would
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
you believe
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay like i said um everybody's in
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
opposition this committee has pretty
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
much been on record for years to is in
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%

brooks
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
but i'm here in my capacity as the
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
chairperson of new hampshire's
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
legislative action committee through the
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
community associations institute
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
i'll try to be brief especially given
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
what you just said
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
but i do just
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
want to convey some information to the
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
committee regarding this bill
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
so associations uh in this state are
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
non-profits and so the only financial
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
resources they have are the assessments
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
they collect from their unit owners they
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
have of course important business to
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
take care of with that money insurance
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
electricity landscaping snow removal
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
things of this nature and all that they
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
have to work with
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
is the budget that they establish and
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
then the assessments they collect from
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
the community and i mentioned that only
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
to make clear that to the extent that
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
the board ends up with their hands tied
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
about the amount of money that they can
 
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
about the amount of money that they can
collect

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
there isn't an alternative resource it's
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
not like they're going to dip into
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
profits or something like that
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't exist for them
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
a few years ago
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
in 2016
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
when there was a large amendment passed
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
to 356b the condominium act in the state
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was included was
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
an explicit fiduciary obligation that
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
the board has to the associations
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
i think it becomes that much more
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
important when a board is saddled with a
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
fiduciary obligation to do what's best
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
for the property i think it becomes that
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
much more important to allow them to do
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
their job
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
for them to to be hamstringed with
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
something as important as the financial
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
resources that are going to be collected
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
over the course of a year and used for
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
the property i think can put them in a
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
very difficult position depending on
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
what the needs of the property are
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
and of course by way of reminder boards
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
are elected by the community which means
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
that in a community where
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
the majority of people don't like what
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
the board is doing they have the ability
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
at the next election to replace all or
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
some of their board
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's what happens when the elections
 
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.150 align:start position:0%
that's what happens when the elections
occur

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
that maintenance
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
the taking care of the property that the
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
board does with the funds that they
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
collect it goes well beyond aesthetics
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
i think unfortunately
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
some folks erroneously believe that it's
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
really just a matter of to what extent a
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
community has curb appeal
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
but it really it goes much deeper than
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
that especially when a property starts
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
to lose curb appeal and then problems
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
sort of further develop
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
we have all at this point heard of the
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
tragedy that occurred in florida
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
the loss of human life in a building
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that community
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
associations institute operates on a
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
national level
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
and in response to that incident they
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
established three national committees to
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
study what went wrong and how that might
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
be avoided in the future
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
i was asked to serve on two of those
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
national committees and i did so
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i will share with you that what came
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
out of those committees were essentially
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
two primary recommendations
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
one that buildings get inspected more
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
frequently by persons qualified to
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
perform those inspections throughout the
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
life of the building especially as it
 
00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:32.950 align:start position:0%
life of the building especially as it
ages

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
ages
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
in two and this relates to the ability
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
of associations to conduct that first
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
aspect the second big recommendation was
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
that communities have to do a better job
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
of raising funds so that they have the
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
money that they need to address problems
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
when they're discovered uh it turns out
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
that down there there's a lot of arguing
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
that there it was known that work needed
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
to be done and there was a lot of
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
arguing about it based on the cost and
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know that's typical
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's basic human nature for people to
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
not want to have to pay more money
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you since working with
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
boards is is all that i do
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
boards don't love raising condo fees
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
they are owners as well and they pay
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
those same fees so they're getting hit
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
with whatever increase they apply to the
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
community as well
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
in addition the board members feel the
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
ire of the community so they don't take
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
it lightly and they don't want to do it
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
but there are times when they need to do
 
00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:31.750 align:start position:0%
but there are times when they need to do
it

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.710 align:start position:0%
it
and

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
looking ahead unfortunately in the
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
immediate future
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
based on the increasing costs of
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
everything based on inflation that's
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
applying to everything in the years
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
ahead boards are going to have to
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
increase their budgets possibly
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
substantially just to maintain the same
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
level of services that they're getting
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
now so the idea that there would be an
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
inability on their part
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
to raise the fees without having a
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
majority of the community appear to say
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes we want to pay more
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
is is not workable and it's putting
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
those board members in what i think is
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
going to be a really untenable
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
situation and it's doing so
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
or would do so if this bill passed for
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
no good reason because as the sponsor
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
just explained to you mechanisms already
 
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
just explained to you mechanisms already
exist

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
the communities in new hampshire based
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
on the existing law have the ability to
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
override the board's budget yes it's by
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
a two-thirds majority but that's the
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
same standard that applies in most sets
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
of condominium documents for other
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
community decisions including amendments
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
to their documents so it's not
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to have that standard in
 
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.470 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to have that standard in
fact

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
i was here when it was being considered
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i said it then and i'll say it again
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
now it's entirely appropriate that it
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
takes a majority of the community to
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
reject the board's budget because it's
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
the board that has the obligation to
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
create the budget in the first place and
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
has a fiduciary obligation to make that
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
budget suitable for what they know the
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
needs of the property to be
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
but again if a board came up with an
 
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.270 align:start position:0%
but again if a board came up with an
absolutely

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
absurd budget the community does have a
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
means to act already
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's in place so
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
i also just want to mention briefly
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
because bankers were mentioned to you in
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
issue of associations getting bank loans
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat of a popular
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
thing right now because a lot of
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
associations have not set aside the
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
money that they should have over the
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
past you know 20 30 years for what are
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
now major projects coming due the
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
lending industry has responded they do
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
offer products now loans that are
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
specifically geared towards condominiums
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they have already
 
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.870 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they have already
adapted

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
adapted
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
since 2016
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
when they found out that the community
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
could even by the two-thirds reject the
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
board's budget they changed the closing
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
documents to protect themselves and the
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
bankers have told me that directly there
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
are now additional papers required that
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
the board needs to sign additional votes
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
that need to happen and be documented
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
specifically because the banks are now
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
being asked to lend money to
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
associations whose communities
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
next year could show up at the annual
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
meeting and reject the board's budget
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
so even under existing law
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
the bankers have already had to take
 
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.669 align:start position:0%
the bankers have already had to take
account

00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
the risk associated and they've already
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
done that
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
so i would submit to you that that's not
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
really an issue here so
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
in closing i would just like to say that
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire legislative action
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee of the community association's
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
institute opposes the bill
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
we oppose it for the reasons that i've
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
stated and
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
we hope that you will
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
leave the law as it currently stands it
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
is sufficient in this area and again in
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
the immediate future it's really what is
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
needed more so than than what's being
 
00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.549 align:start position:0%
needed more so than than what's being
proposed

00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you do you accept questions
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
do um
 
00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.669 align:start position:0%
do um
condominiums

00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
condominiums
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
get advised in terms of amortization of
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
debt in other words
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
do they put aside money
 
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.909 align:start position:0%
do they put aside money
for

00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
areas that might need uh work are
 
00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
areas that might need uh work are
predictable

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
so a lot try to do that
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
i can't say that it's universally done
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
but there are engineers that are capable
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
of providing specific reports some of
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
these engineers much like certain
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys or accountants or other types
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
of businesses actually specialize in
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
working with condominiums and boards can
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
get a study that tracks you know what
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
their needs will be in the future
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
the engineers that do a good job with
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
this even project
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
you know the rising costs over time and
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
things like that so that um associations
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know would be able to put the money
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
aside unfortunately you know all of the
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
associations that are 20 30 years old
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
haven't necessarily done that to the
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
extent they should and that's why the
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
bank loans are becoming popular
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
for those who have to face major
 
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.149 align:start position:0%
for those who have to face major
projects

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming before commerce again
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
mr d'addario
 
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
mr d'addario
welcome

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
have you had a chance to run this bill
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
back past any of um your the condo
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
associations you represent
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
and what could i just ask you for the
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
question thank you um if you've had a
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
a sense of what some of them feel
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh certainly if i were to summarize
 
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.070 align:start position:0%
uh certainly if i were to summarize
overwhelmingly

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
my clients feel that if changes like
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
this are made to the law
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
that uh being on the board will be no
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
place to be in the future
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
because if you pass a budget that
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
accounts for the financial needs of the
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
association but it involves an increase
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the fee and then the community shows
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
up to say we're not paying it
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
then as a board member you don't want to
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
be there saddled with the responsibility
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the consequences of what happens if
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
the property isn't properly cared for
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
and so most board members
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm hearing from would leave the
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
post and many of them have no idea who
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
would step up under those circumstances
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
well fat
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you uh
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
be sure to push the red button
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%

people i'm here today to voice my strong
 
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.710 align:start position:0%
people i'm here today to voice my strong
opposition

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
to hb 1146
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
as it currently stands it is hard enough
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
to get unit owners to run for the board
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
positions many condos that i represent
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
have unfilled board positions and have
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
to beg people to stand as a board member
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
owner apathy
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
is a struggle and participation
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes is difficult
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
this bill will create an untenable
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
situation from that perspective
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
it will make the ability to pass a
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
budget much more complicated but beyond
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
that it will have other implications
 
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.110 align:start position:0%
that it will have other implications
and

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
they came to me as i sat here this
 
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.070 align:start position:0%
they came to me as i sat here this
morning

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
as a an owner of a large management
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
company we are requested to provide
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
information to lending institutions
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
regarding reserve levels uh regarding a
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
whole array of different questions so a
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
person can get a loan
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
the standards have increased since the
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
tragedy at surfside in florida
 
00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:19.430 align:start position:0%
tragedy at surfside in florida
exponentially

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
exponentially
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
banks and mortgage companies are very
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
hesitant to lend money to condominium
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
associations if a bill like this comes
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
to fruition
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
not only will it create problems
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
internally it will make it virtually
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
impossible for condominium owners to
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
sell their units because institutions
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
will look at it and say the funding
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
levels are not sufficient as attorney
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
daddario said
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
there is an outcry when there is an
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
increase in fees but people have come to
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
understand it and frankly they're going
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
to have to understand it a lot more as
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
time passes the whole landscape of the
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
condominium association from an
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
operational perspective is changing and
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
all of it is now being pointed to
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
surfside in florida
 
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.510 align:start position:0%
surfside in florida
the

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
situation there
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
has caused people to re-look at the
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
construction stability and operation of
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
community associations and with that the
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
only way they prosper is if there is
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
sufficient funding to maintain them this
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
bill will have a chilling effect on
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
having that funding available
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
with that said i ask you the current law
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
is more than sufficient it gives the
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in the association
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
a voice i think it was was well crafted
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i see at this point no reason to
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
change it i ask you to find this bill in
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
expedient the legislate
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh i see none good thank you thank you
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%

past speakers in their opposition
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
and our association board is in strong
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill for the same
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
reasons that we just talked about and
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
i won't reiterate all of those items
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
we are volunteers
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
there are five of us and if we had to
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
hire a management company
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
to do the work for our association it
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
would be thousands of dollars in extra
 
00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.389 align:start position:0%
would be thousands of dollars in extra
expense

00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
expense
 
00:28:52.399 --> 00:28:53.430 align:start position:0%
expense
and

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
from what i've heard our own association
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
we've been doing a great job we have a
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
good reserve
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
we've only had to raise our fees once
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
from believe it or not 115 to 125
 
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.909 align:start position:0%
from believe it or not 115 to 125
dollars

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
and i do recall that when we did that 10
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
dollar increase we did have some people
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
who were
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed to it but we had to do
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
it to keep up with the expenses of our
 
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.190 align:start position:0%
it to keep up with the expenses of our
association

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.230 align:start position:0%
association
if

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
our volunteer board
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
is restricted
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
is proposing
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
that i can tell you right now that the
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
five of us would probably resign because
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want to take on the
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
liabilities that would be facing us
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what would happen i
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody would step up to
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
serve on the board because we haven't
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
been able in seven years to get anyone
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
to step up uh and it comes up every year
 
00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:48.870 align:start position:0%
to step up uh and it comes up every year
as

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
the board seats rotate nobody's come up
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we'd be able to get
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
anybody to do that
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have 80 and 90 year old residents in
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
our community who don't come to meetings
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to come to meetings
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes they vote sometimes they don't
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
so it would be very very difficult
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
for us uh to maintain what we've done in
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
and we've done a good job so we are in
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
total opposition
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you very much
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
sir velo
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is vincent
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
cervelo i'm

from 335 fox run road in hudson so i
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
speak for myself as well as being the
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
president of the village of barrett hill
 
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.549 align:start position:0%
president of the village of barrett hill
association

00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
and i very much like the other gentleman
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
before me and in opposition to uh
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
this bill it serves no purpose because
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
the board per se has a an a difficult
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
job in itself just to conduct business
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
in a normal normal cycle to add anything
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
more to that you know we our board
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
members are parsimonious and judicious
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
in how we
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
we handle
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
fees and we don't have any assessments
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
because in our monthly programs or
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
monthly fees we adjust for both the
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
operating budget and the reserves to
 
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.389 align:start position:0%
operating budget and the reserves to
replace

00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
replace
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately this year we've been
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
faced with
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
we're replacing decks at this
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
association that's 30 years old and
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
we've got wood prices that have gone up
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
35 to 40 percent to cope difficult to
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
cope with
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
snow plowing the landscaping have gone
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
up from 15 to 30 percent
 
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.590 align:start position:0%
up from 15 to 30 percent
unseen

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
unseen
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
escalations in prices
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know we have five board members and
 
00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:57.350 align:start position:0%
you know we have five board members and
we

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
continually approach the community about
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
providing you know more board members
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
and volunteering and everything else and
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the hard reality is that
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
only a minuscule amount ever comes
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
forward to provide those
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
the board is a representative governance
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the the association and we try to do
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
it always in the best interest of all
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
the residents uh on an ongoing basis so
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
this this bill should just be allowed to
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
die quietly because it serves no purpose
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for listening to me
 
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.509 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for listening to me
okay

00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's 304 units it's a large property
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
i also serve as vice president of the
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
board there
 
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.549 align:start position:0%
board there
and

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
we regularly have difficulty meeting
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
the 33 and a third uh quorum to just get
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
the business of the annual meeting done
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
and um sometimes we have to take two or
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
three passes at that that's the level of
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
apathy and that's really what we're all
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
struggling with here is the apathy uh um
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
so uh i believe owners do have a voice
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.430 align:start position:0%
and um
if

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.630 align:start position:0%
if
if

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
if uh the impacts of
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would be
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
very damaging to boards trying to get
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
business done if there's an emergency
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
repair they have to go out and it's very
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
very hard to get
 
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.789 align:start position:0%
very hard to get
um

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
get participation from owners um in in
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
our association about 70 percent of the
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
um condos are rented so owners may not
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
even be in this country very often it's
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
just difficult to get uh people on board
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
i uh i
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
just strongly urge you all to consider
 
00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:08.869 align:start position:0%
just strongly urge you all to consider
the

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
it's already difficult for volunteers
 
00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:12.470 align:start position:0%
it's already difficult for volunteers
um

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
to provide good fiscal governance i'm
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
very lucky i've served on a board that's
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
never had a special assessment in 40
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
years but the property is 40 years old
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
and it does need constant repair and
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
getting those things done is very
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
difficult and it would not serve any
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
member of the association have a board's
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
hands tied here so i do urge you to
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill accordingly thank you

representative from hillsborough
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
district 45
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
45 spans the three wards on the west
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
side of manchester
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
the northernmost ward where i live
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
borders on hooksett and many condominium
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
and homeowners associations
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
have been developed there for the clerk
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
i do have a written testimony that i
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
will get to you afterward
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
although i will deviate from it perhaps
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to begin
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
differently than i had planned
 
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.150 align:start position:0%
differently than i had planned
um

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
i think perhaps we need to do some
 
00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
i think perhaps we need to do some
definitions

00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh the people behind me who have spoken
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
on behalf of condominiums and
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
condominium associations
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
are different than the people that would
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
be referenced with this bill
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
condominiums and condominium
 
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.990 align:start position:0%
condominiums and condominium
associations

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
are different from homeowners
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
associations in a couple of basic ways
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most basic way is that the
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
condominium owner owns an individual
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
unit i am a condominium owner i own a
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
unit i don't own a building a
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
freestanding building i don't own any
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
lawn i don't know any of those types of
 
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
lawn i don't know any of those types of
things

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
i am a member of the communities
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
association though and i share an
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
ownership stake
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
in what the association owns
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
now the homeowners association which is
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
the subject of the bill before us today
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
is different each owner owns an
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
individual property perhaps an
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
individual lot as well so for the most
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
part when we talk about homeowners
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
association we are talking about
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
freestanding units
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
in both types of associations both types
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
of communities there are shared and
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
common interests and and those will be
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
impactful as we talk about the bill here
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
so to return to my comments i'm here
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
today to introduce
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
house bill 1380 on behalf of
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
constituents whoever they said are my
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
neighbors and other new hampshire
 
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.870 align:start position:0%
neighbors and other new hampshire
citizens

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
many of them contacted me after a 2020
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
house bill passed by this committee was
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
passed by the house on a voice vote and
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
then of course
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
covid reared its head and the senate
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
laid the bill on the table
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
the bill before you today is identical
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
to that bill
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
hb 1380 prohibits homeowners association
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
deeds or other instruments pertaining to
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
conveyance of real property or interest
 
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.470 align:start position:0%
conveyance of real property or interest
therein

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
therein
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
from prohibiting or restricting the
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
installation and use of solar
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
photovoltaic energy systems
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
the bill makes any portion of a deed or
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
other legal instrument that prohibits or
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
places unreasonable limits
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
on the installation or use of solar void
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
and unenforceable
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
installation or use of solar systems
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
would no longer be subject to terms of
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
the governing documents
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the homeowners associations under
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
this bill does not require that such
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
documents be rewritten however and it is
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
not a mandate
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
instead hb 1380 puts the decision about
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
solar into the hands of the owner of the
 
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
solar into the hands of the owner of the
unit

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
rather than by permission of others such
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
as the board of directors
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
currently though it would be possible
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
for an association on an individual
 
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.630 align:start position:0%
for an association on an individual
basis

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
to grant some requests for solar
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
installation and use and not others
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
thereby even changing the physical
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
unifor uniformity of the association
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
that many people cherish as well
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
i do realize that there are objections
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
to this a bill of this sort uh part of
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the fact that condo
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
and homeowner's law is relatively young
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
in the scheme of things
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
i do understand and am respectful of
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
those differences and those concerns
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
however in bringing this bill forward on
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of constituents and other new
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents i am honoring their
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about increasing costs of
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
energy and the ramifications of those
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
increasing costs
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the need for clean and renewable
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
energy and expansion of its use
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
some association documents have existed
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
and more new hampshire citizens and
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
residents have gravitated to ownership
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
and living in communities of homeowners
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
associations since those documents were
 
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.589 align:start position:0%
associations since those documents were
written

00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
but the landscape of our current world
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
colored by topics like inflation supply
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
chain issues and climate concerns
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned in everyday news has changed
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not without
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
precedent for example the california
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
solar rights act
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
prevents homeowners associations
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me these masks are difficult to
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
breathe through sometimes
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
the california solar
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
solar rights act prevents hoas or
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations from limiting a
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
person's ability to install solar panels
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
as do more than two dozen other states
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
solar installation would still be
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
subject to local ordnance ordinances
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
zoning regulation permitting and
 
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.230 align:start position:0%
zoning regulation permitting and
inspection

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
and would not intrude upon common or
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
limited common elements of the
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
association again that's because in the
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
homeowners association the owner owns
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
the building as well as probably the lot
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
the bill however would allow an owner or
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
owners of a unit under their control to
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
make choices about their energy systems
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
and cost of energy
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'd like to close by just highlighting
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
three of the misconceptions that exist
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
partially because of the interchangeable
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
use of the words condo and homeowners
 
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.349 align:start position:0%
use of the words condo and homeowners
association

00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
first of all homeowners and are not
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations are not condos
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
the property is controlled by the owner
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
and therefore this bill would talk about
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
installation on that property not on
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
common areas
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
so if i owned a homeowner if i were in a
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
homeowners association and owned my own
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
building and controlled my roof took
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
care of the repairs for my roof and
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
other another ways had control of my
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
roof i could put my solar panels there
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
that would not be considered common
 
00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:19.910 align:start position:0%
that would not be considered common
property

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
also this is not a mandate
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
it is actually almost the reverse of a
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
mandate it's lifting a requirement that
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
exists in some homeowners association
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
documents the requirement being that
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
solo panthers panels cannot be used and
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
therefore there would be a freeing of
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
the ability of the homeowner who owns
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
the building
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
to use solar panels if he wished he or
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
she wished sorry
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
the documents
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
documents as you've heard from people
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
behind me talking about condominiums are
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
critical to the running and operation
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
of any kind of a community
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
organization like this
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
those documents would not become void
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
and unenforceable
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing that this bill as it's
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
written and as the other 24 plus bills
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
are written would do
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
is to make sections or portions that
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
talk about solar panels
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
void and unenforceable the documents
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
would not need to be written the
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
documents would stand however there
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
would be aspects that were unenforceable
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
that is also what we see in other
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
legislation throughout the country
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for allowing me
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
to present this it is a
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
passion of many of my constituents to
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
have solar for many reasons
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
related to economy related to clean air
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to exist in home in which
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
they will be happy and comfortable for
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
many years i'll take questions thank you
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative abel
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes welcome back we're so happy to see
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
you good to see you thank you
 
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.030 align:start position:0%
you good to see you thank you
um

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe that i live in a
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
homeowners association in which
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
which are all
 
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.230 align:start position:0%
which are all
evolve

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
evolve
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
individual structures
 
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.430 align:start position:0%
individual structures
and

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
in which there are
 
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.710 align:start position:0%
in which there are
some

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
houses that have solar panels and some
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
do not and this has existed for a long
 
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.230 align:start position:0%
do not and this has existed for a long
time

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
and i just
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
want uh but
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
would you that's my first question i
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
have a second question uh absolutely
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
although we talk about uniformity when
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
we talk about homeowners associations um
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
by virtue even of topography things are
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
different um some people are not
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
oriented to to be able to harness solar
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
for instance and would not be interested
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
in it interested in it some people live
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
on hills and the driveways are
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
configured differently so um although
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
there is a great deal of uniformity
 
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.470 align:start position:0%
there is a great deal of uniformity
there

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist total uniformity and
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
apparently your homeowners association
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
is elected to allow solar to be part of
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
that change from uniformity
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
further question yes thank you um
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
my question involves whether the solar
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
panels would be on the roof of a
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
building or could be
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
i think there are probably four or five
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
different placements that that have
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
worked in
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations that have used
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh this bill to get solar energy for
 
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.550 align:start position:0%
uh this bill to get solar energy for
them

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.589 align:start position:0%
them
um

00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
the bill specifies that common areas
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
cannot be used for placement and so the
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
condo ducts the not the docks i'm sorry
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
the association docks the documents that
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
go with the homeowners associate
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
association will play a role here
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
if for instance you have a unit it's an
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
individual free standing unit and the
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
roof is controlled totally but totally
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
by you you could put your panels there
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
if the lot is also controlled totally
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
totally by you you could put your panels
 
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.550 align:start position:0%
totally by you you could put your panels
there

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
if however according to the documents
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
for the association
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
they are association maintained or no
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
association managed and you do not pay
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
for instance for
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
roof repairs then you could not put them
 
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.550 align:start position:0%
roof repairs then you could not put them
there

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
the common areas
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
element gets a little bit murky because
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
there are things like limited common
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
areas and true common areas but as
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
crafted this bill
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
only allows you to put
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
you as a homeowners association member
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
allows you to put these panels in places
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
that you are in control of
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
and the roof or the lawn if that were
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
the case by documents could be those
 
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.710 align:start position:0%
the case by documents could be those
places

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you representative
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
what is the definition of significantly
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to significantly
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
increasing the cost or expense or
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
significantly decreasing the efficiency
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
and who determines whether it's
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
significant well that would again be a
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
board thing a lot of these a lot of
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
these elements with homeowners
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
associations as i said are run by
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
documents and boards and so the board of
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
directors would probably assume that um
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
let's say that they um wanted to be sure
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
you maybe they would ask you to only put
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
your panels in a certain area of the
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
property and perhaps that area of the
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
property does not get enough solar
 
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.190 align:start position:0%
property does not get enough solar
interaction

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
to harness this energy that would
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
probably significantly reduce that
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
however as as i think with most things
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
particularly with with condo and
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
homeowners association law being as
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
young as it is i think some of these
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
things are evolving as we go and some of
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
them as as we've heard from people
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
behind me with whom i agree on a lot of
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
issues but some of them are up to the
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
board of directors or volunteer group
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
who do their very best to to manage the
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
associations that they that they deal
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
with and to come up with the right
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
answers and some of the things we've
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
talked about previously
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
involve mechanisms to make sure that
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
those best interests are are are
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
maintained so to answer your question
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure a hundred percent
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
but it would be within the homeowners
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
association themselves to to work those
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
types of things out but seriously if
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
someone told me that i could put my
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
solar panels only inside my garage
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
um i would have a concern
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess that's where my question
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
would aim at
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
given that we we don't single family
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
homes and i know homeowners associations
 
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.549 align:start position:0%
homes and i know homeowners associations
can

00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason they want to call it
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
for the for the discussion purpose we're
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
talking about people who own
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
their own house in a stand-alone
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
separate building
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
do you actually have a story or an
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
analogy story where
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to put photovoltaics on
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
their building and went to their
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
homeowners association and they the
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
homeowner association said no yes um and
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
that was the genesis of my reintroducing
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
this bill which was also in the last
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
session um
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
the woman is has currently moved but
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's like a psychiatrist
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
i i do live in a condu association but
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
just above me is a homeowners
 
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.630 align:start position:0%
just above me is a homeowners
association

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
and she had a marvelous marvelous home
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
um very nice and and very well appointed
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
and she was she did request solar from
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
her condo association they did put it to
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
a vote that was their means of of
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue and she came she
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
came armed with a lot of information
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
she just sold that that caught the her
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
freestanding condo for half a million
 
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
freestanding condo for half a million
dollars

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
but she was also told that that could
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
easily have been a hundred thousand
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
dollars more
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
she also gave me some figures that
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
showed that she could have recouped the
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
cost of of her equipment her
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
installation equipment
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
in seven or eight years this is 03102 so
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's uh near hooksett
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh and that
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of that seven year period she
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
would have paid off the insulation costs
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
begun savings and then being able to
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh return some of that energy
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
under a net metering relationship but
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
she was denied
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
since then the neighbors decided they
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
didn't want her to do that right and
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
what they were citing was the aesthetic
 
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.309 align:start position:0%
what they were citing was the aesthetic
element

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
element
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
i i understand that i understand that
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
people buy condominiums and and
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
homeowners association buildings because
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
they do agree with the aesthetic as i've
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
said again i don't want to mix things up
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
here but i do live in a condominium
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
i have previously owned another
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
condominium i've served on boards of
 
00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:21.670 align:start position:0%
condominium i've served on boards of
directors

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
directors
 
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.549 align:start position:0%
directors
um

00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about homeowners
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
associations no i'm just i'm coming to a
 
00:50:26.319 --> 00:50:28.470 align:start position:0%
associations no i'm just i'm coming to a
point

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
there when i bought my condo there were
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
many many things that i could check off
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
my list for there were a few things that
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
i totally didn't like
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
i had to accept that that uniformity was
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
not going to totally happen i have some
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
incredible pillars
 
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.109 align:start position:0%
incredible pillars
that

00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
i understand they are thematically
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate but they've always bothered
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
me it didn't stop me from buying from
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
buying the um the condo association so
 
00:50:53.119 --> 00:50:55.430 align:start position:0%
buying the um the condo association so
uniformity

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
uniformity
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
and by the way other units don't have
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
those pillars
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
i sometimes wonder why me why do i end
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
up with these pillars
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
but the uniformity aspect it's important
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
the aesthetic element is important but
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking here about energy savings
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking here about clean energy
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the futures
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
of the condominium uh and as homeowners
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
associations i heard a report driving in
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
this morning that gas prices are likely
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
to hit four dollars a gallon in the very
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
near future
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh energy costs energy uses um are
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
important to us especially in the world
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
that has changed so drastically in the
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:42.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
similar to last bill we have
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
nobody else in support so we'll just go
 
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.309 align:start position:0%
nobody else in support so we'll just go
through

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:53.109 align:start position:0%
through
the

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
opposition and we'll start out with the
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
community association let's do with gary
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
d'adrio once you start out gary and
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
good morning again and thank you again
 
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.309 align:start position:0%
good morning again and thank you again
for

00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
allowing me some time for the record my
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
name is gary d'addario i'm here in my
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
capacity as the chair of the new
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislative action committee
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
of the community associations institute
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i practice community association law
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire

that's the sole focus of my practice
 
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.950 align:start position:0%
that's the sole focus of my practice
so

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'll begin with
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
some of the actual language of the bill
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
it starts out by saying that any
 
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.829 align:start position:0%
it starts out by saying that any
covenant

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
covenant
 
00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:47.190 align:start position:0%
covenant
condition

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
or restriction
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
contained in any deed contract mortgage
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
security instrument or other instrument
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they unreasonably uh
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
restrict one's ability to install solar
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
shall be void and unenforceable
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's really pretty bright actually i
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.430 align:start position:0%
want to
so

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me empowerment i just want to
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
take a quick step back
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
we are not to be clear
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
both as a group and myself personally
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
we're not against the idea of solar or
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
against the idea of
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
clean energy we're just not i myself had
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
solar installed at the last house that i
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
lived in
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
but i was not within an association and
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
there weren't any uh documents or
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions that i was supposed to
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to make that much clearer
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
getting back to the language of the bill
 
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.349 align:start position:0%
getting back to the language of the bill
um

00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
what i just read was very broad
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
these documents deeds and contracts
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
mortgages security instruments
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
they already exist
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of folks out there
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
who i think we should consider
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
and who presumably wanted to get the
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
benefit of their bargain
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
i understand that homeowners
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
associations are different than
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
condominiums but i represent homeowners
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
associations as well
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
and what they have in common is that
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
like condominiums they exist in part
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
because of their documents
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
their documents create these
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods they lay out the terms and
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
conditions uh by which they're supposed
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
to operate and the restrictions that
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
presumably all of those who voluntarily
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
agree to buy into that association are
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
willing to live by
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
and so um i think they really need to be
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to to go ahead and do that to to
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
live within the confines of the
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
governing documents that created them
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
and that everyone who's become a member
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the meantime had an opportunity to
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
review and presumably agree to live by
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
those owners who bought on the basis of
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
restrictions and these people exist i've
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
spoken to them
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
for some they really have a primary
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
interest and a primary focus on living
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
in a community that has a very set
 
00:55:09.119 --> 00:55:10.549 align:start position:0%
in a community that has a very set
appearance

00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
appearance
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
including all the consistency and
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
everything looking the same the way they
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
do in condominiums and associations and
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see why we should deprive those
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
folks of the benefit of the bargain if
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
they found an association whose
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
documents had restrictions that they
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
wanted some folks have bought into the
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
association because they wanted to live
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
around people with those restrictions
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that having been said it's also
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
important to note that those
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions can change internally
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't need to override and
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
overrule all of these documents and say
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
that they're unenforceable and and say
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
what associations can and can't do
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
because they have that power already
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
through the amendment process
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
so in any association that for whatever
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
reason has documents
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
that would be overly restrictive of of
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
solar right now
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
to the extent that a majority of that
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
community decided that they wanted solar
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
they would simply vote to amend the
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
documents and make the necessary changes
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
and adopt solar and i think that we
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
should let communities do it that way
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
because again otherwise what we would
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
really have is the state
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
imposing changes and invalidating
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
documents that already exist
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
that that people feel that they should
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
be living by and that courts would
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
enforce as covenants running with the
 
00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:35.990 align:start position:0%
enforce as covenants running with the
land

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
land
 
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.789 align:start position:0%
land
um

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh my last comments would be this uh
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
based on what the the bill sponsor said
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that this is intended
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
to apply for
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
or to homeowners associations and not to
 
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.870 align:start position:0%
or to homeowners associations and not to
condominiums

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
condominiums
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
i think that easily enough
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
a provision could be inserted that
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
explicitly states that it doesn't apply
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
to condominiums i think without that
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
they would certainly be those folks who
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
would argue that perhaps it does
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
especially since it's being inserted
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
into 477 which is more of a general real
 
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.150 align:start position:0%
into 477 which is more of a general real
estate

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
estate
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
section of the rsas
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
my next comment about if the bill was
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
was to move forward
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
by way of recommendation um again we
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
heard from the bill sponsor that
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
the bill is not meant to allow owners to
 
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.270 align:start position:0%
the bill is not meant to allow owners to
put

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
solar equipment in places that they
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't control
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
in other words the common areas of an
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
association which you know no owner has
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
a right
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
to exercise dominion over
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
to that end i know that that's the word
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's used in the statute areas
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
controlled by such an owner
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
but in my experience whether we're
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
condominiums or associations the
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
documents generally don't speak in terms
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
of control
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's more about ownership
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know owners own their unit or in the
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
case of a homeowner association they may
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
own the home itself the whole
 
00:58:04.799 --> 00:58:06.390 align:start position:0%
own the home itself the whole
freestanding

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
freestanding
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
but they typically don't own other areas
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh in any event my suggestion is to
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
replace the term controlled um because
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
it could cause uh potential confusion
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
um with um areas that are solely owned
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
by the unit owner in question and i
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
think that that would at least if this
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill were to go forward i think that
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
that would at least uh prevent some
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
confusion in some arguments that might
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise occur over where things might
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
be placed
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
representative herbert has a question
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
so am i correct in
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
am i correct in assuming that say
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
technology changes or whatever occurs in
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
gas goes net gas goes to a hundred
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
the existing law allows for
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
a democratic vote of the association
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
and and that can change
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
the uh so so the state legislature is
 
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.789 align:start position:0%
the uh so so the state legislature is
not

00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
needed a new law
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
outside of what your recommendation is
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's you already have the ability we
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
already have the ability as a homeowners
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
association to
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
update and if we so wish
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
correct that's actually i would suggest
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
an excellent way to describe the
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
situation that this bill isn't needed
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
because if a community wanted
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
to allow for solar they could do that
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
through the document amendment process
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
that already exists that would be based
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
on a vote of that community
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
and by the way the reason why that's a
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
lot more fair
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
is that when people accept deeds
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
to properties that are in condominiums
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
or associations one of the provisions
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
states not only that they're taking
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
ownership of the property subject to
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
those documents but standard language
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
also says that they're taking the
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
property subject to any amendments to
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
those documents
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
and so that if that community should
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
vote to so amend their documents
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
technically speaking those owners all of
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
them even the ones that didn't want to
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
see you know a solar panel perhaps
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
all of them have agreed to live by those
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
documents if they're amended as well
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
but again the amendment that's
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
contemplated is by the community
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know not by the force of the state
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
good morning again good morning mr
 
01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:05.190 align:start position:0%
good morning again good morning mr
chairman

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
yeah mike yeah sorry
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the ceo and founder of great north
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
property management
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
who manages approximately 25 000
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
condominium and homeowners association
 
01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:16.789 align:start position:0%
condominium and homeowners association
units

01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
i'm here today although i support clean
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
energy options and i believe in them i'm
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
here today to voice my strong objection
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1380. i'm doing so for the
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
following reasons and much of which
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
is reiterating with attorney
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
daddario said
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
many people buy into hoas homeowner
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
associations because they enjoy clean
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
and cohesive atmosphere in a
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
neighborhood governed by
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
established association documentations
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
and rules and regulations
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
that they understood when they acquired
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
in this particular bill essentially
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
those restrictions
 
01:01:58.559 --> 01:01:59.670 align:start position:0%
those restrictions
those

01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
deeds are all going to be upended
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
in an effort to allow something that the
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
members did not bargain for when they
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
acquired the property
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
as attorney daddario said the resolution
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
in an association is very simple you
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
amend the documents to allow it and if
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
association wants it and if the majority
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
of unit owners want it
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
then you amend it
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
you cannot allow the minority of one
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
person or two people to control the
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
majority it's not fair it's not
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate so with that said i'm not
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
going to prolong your agony
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
i ask you to find this an expedient to
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
legislate i think it's bad public policy
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
to try to insert yourself into something
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
that already exists in statute and in
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
law so have a great day great thank you
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
chair we'll call on uh
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
we get the right bill here make sure all
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
right vincent uh cervelo
 
01:03:01.599 --> 01:03:06.789 align:start position:0%
right vincent uh cervelo
again

01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
morning again good morning again since
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
the the issues and the salient points
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
have already been
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
outlined there's no need for me to say
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
anything further and
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
i also favor clean energy and efficient
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
energy where we can secure it um
 
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.870 align:start position:0%
energy where we can secure it um
but

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
you know the the fact that heating oil
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
and gasoline have gone up from gasoline
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
in particular from 150
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
to now 350 is purely and simply the
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
function of bad policy in washington
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
and it's an incumbent i think on people
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
to really push back on on those types of
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
adjudications that cause that kind of
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
escalation because otherwise we have
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
plenty of fossil fuel in this country
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much okay thank you
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
good morning again good morning again
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself and my wife and
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
board of directors of my association
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking in total opposition of this
 
01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:15.109 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking in total opposition of this
bill

01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see why the state should mandate
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
something that we can all already do and
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's already been approved i don't
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
understand that and with all due respect
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not california i would
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
we own our own building and we could put
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
solar panels on our roof
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
my wife personally thinks they are
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
hideous and ugly
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
but someday and i've read something
 
01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.109 align:start position:0%
but someday and i've read something
about

01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
some company was trying to develop roof
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
shingles that would actually act as
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
if that happened maybe our association
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
would change and amend our documents and
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
allow it
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
another example
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
that would be comparable to what my wife
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
says about solar panels is we did have
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
one unit member put up pink flamingos on
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
her lawn
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any doc documents or
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
amendments that said that she couldn't
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.390 align:start position:0%
do that
but

01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
when her neighbors saw it they were down
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
in less than a week
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
and we've since made provisions for that
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
not to happen again
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
um we we control our association we have
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
votes it's the democratic process
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's working great
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
i would think
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
99.999 of the time
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
so i really don't understand why
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
this should be mandated and
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
we are in total opposition and i thank
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of pink flamingos in our
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
area because we're very close to
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
lunenburg leominster where they're all
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
made made in america so everybody seems
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%

an email uh pretty well stating my
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
opinion i am president of the condo
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
association at white rock and bow and
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
one thing that has
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
continually gone through my mind is i am
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
quite surprised that these two bills
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
even were introduced into uh and got as
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
far as they have gotten on what is
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
basically internal matters within
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
individual condo associations to which
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
people buy into
 
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
people buy into
voluntarily

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
asked to stay if they choose not to
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
like what's going on they have voices
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
they can oppose anything
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
but they are asked to live within what
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
they bought into which i have them sign
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
off on when they come they are presented
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
with the rules and regulations and the
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
condo docs they are asked to sign a
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
paper saying that they have read
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
and accept those rules and regulations
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
and it is by far not necessary for a
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
state to come in
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
and and even
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
suggest that these rules and regulations
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
to which they have agreed to can be
 
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.670 align:start position:0%
to which they have agreed to can be
overridden

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
overridden
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's what i have to say
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%

i will open up the public hearing on
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
1378 and he's got his microphone on so
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
good morning representativery thank you
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is jordan ullery
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative hillsborough 37 and i'm
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
introducing house bill 1378
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the inspection of public
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
lodging houses
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh bill it places no burden
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
not already placed on the business
 
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.430 align:start position:0%
not already placed on the business
to

01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
maintain records
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
all it does is say that these records
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
need to be available
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
on the presentation of a warrant
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
our local chief of police and several of
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
the other surrounding towns that have a
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
lot larger number of motels routinely
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
get a warrant
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
for this type of uh information
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of privacy if you remember
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
back a few
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
we passed out of the uh general court an
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to the uh constitution that
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
was put on the ballot
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's one of the few
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments that was
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
actually passed by an overwhelming
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
number of individuals and or persons
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
are when it was put on the ballot that
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
is a right to privacy we each have
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire enshrined in our
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
constitution a right to privacy
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
now the extent of that privacy can be
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
limited in certain cases we don't have a
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
right to privately kill someone
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
but we have the right
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
to general privacy
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
in our daily activities
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
and if we want to uh
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually something well there's our the
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
website that
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's out there that allows you to to
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.719 --> 01:13:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
fine

01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
01:13:08.159 --> 01:13:08.870 align:start position:0%
you know that's
a

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
choice that you made and the other
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
person hopefully was doing it
 
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.350 align:start position:0%
person hopefully was doing it
consensually

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
consensually
 
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.229 align:start position:0%
consensually
so

01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's perfectly fine
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's not fine but it's
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
none of the sheriff's interest as to
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh who's in that particular room and
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
what their names are
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
on a general
 
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.630 align:start position:0%
on a general
search

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
search
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
just a broad blanket search of what's
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
which is what current law allows the
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
sheriff or police officer or i would
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
assume even though they're not mentioned
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
because the state police didn't
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
exist in uh what was it
 
01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:48.310 align:start position:0%
exist in uh what was it
um

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.470 align:start position:0%
um
1923

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
1923
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
when the bill was first or when this law
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
was first put into effect
 
01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.830 align:start position:0%
was first put into effect
so

01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
it's a really simple bill all we're
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
doing is saying yeah have to have a
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
present or a warrant
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
to which probable cause has been
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
attested which warrants have that's part
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
of a warrant at any rate
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
this is a constituent driven
 
01:14:16.719 --> 01:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
this is a constituent driven
bill

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.270 align:start position:0%
bill
the

01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
constituent is here he has testimony
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
that he would like to give as mr khan
 
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
that he would like to give as mr khan
and

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
regarding his family's own experience
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.630 align:start position:0%
which is
are

01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.390 align:start position:0%
are
disturbing

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.270 align:start position:0%
disturbing
but

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
the rule of law is to control government
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
this helps control government
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
now i will admit that the entire chapter
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be updated in some fashion yeah
 
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.310 align:start position:0%
needs to be updated in some fashion yeah
um

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm open to some amendments
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
but the law itself needs to be present
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
for a wide variety of reasons
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
not the least of which is
 
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
not the least of which is
i

01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
had presented a bill to transportation
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
many years ago to allow for the safety
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
inspection of trucks which has already
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
uncovered some into
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
men coming down for labor uh illegal
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
labor and women who are coming down here
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
for the sex trade
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
that was several years ago that's just a
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
safety inspection that was a lot of
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire registered vehicles but
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
now can be applied across the board as a
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
safety inspection so anyone who goes
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
through the toll
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
or the weigh stations can
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
may be subject to that
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
human trafficking is despicable
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh and there needs to be some method of
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
controlling that
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
merely asking for a warrant doesn't get
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
into that uh
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
the fact is that if i go to a motel i'm
 
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.950 align:start position:0%
the fact is that if i go to a motel i'm
expecting

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
expecting
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
some privacy of being in that hotel
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
while i'm there and not having the local
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
jean armory come in and
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
just and i know they don't and i know
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
this is going to sound
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
bad but they can right now just go
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
through the card and see who's there
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
and for what you know that's just all
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
just to see who's there
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
the 1970s
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
isn't appropriate
 
01:16:26.159 --> 01:16:28.310 align:start position:0%
isn't appropriate
today

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's the essence of the bill i'd be
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the committee of
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
further additions or modifications of
 
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.310 align:start position:0%
further additions or modifications of
this

01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
particular chapter need to be taken are
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
there any questions mr chairman
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
evidently we do representative burroughs
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
is first
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for question taking my
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
question and this is a would you believe
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
and what do you think scenario this is a
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
real story in my community we had a
 
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.030 align:start position:0%
real story in my community we had a
murder

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
murder
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
an army navy store um
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
there were swat teams all over the place
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
so in that scenario when their time is
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
of the essence and they were i mean the
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
whole town was in lockdown we were
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
terrified of of what had happened
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
how would this bill impacted if if let's
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
say they thought that this person was
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
staying in a certain lodging um facility
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
um how would that impact the timing of
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
them going in to check that
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
under current law and i'm sure the the
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
the sheriff or the attorney general will
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
correct me but under current law
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
if you cannot search a house
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
without a warrant unless
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it's the unless
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
that is the important thing exigent
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances can be abused but they're
 
01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:38.950 align:start position:0%
circumstances can be abused but they're
not

01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
to a large part and if they are
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
then they're going to get
 
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.669 align:start position:0%
then they're going to get
uh

01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
the the entire case
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
is thrown out
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh fruit of the poisonous tree i think
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
is the uh the terminology that's used
 
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.270 align:start position:0%
is the uh the terminology that's used
so

01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have an effect in my view on
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
that because exigent circumstances
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
would allow access to information
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
based upon the life of a person or
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
impending uh harm to a person in the
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
same fashion that uh
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
a non-law enforcement person can use a
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
firearm to defend themselves or others
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up should that be in the bill
 
01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.149 align:start position:0%
follow-up should that be in the bill
though

01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
to specify that i don't think so
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
um i will leave that to the attorneys to
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
to to give some uh extra
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
oomph to it but i don't think so it's
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
not in the it's not in the uh the law
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
for search warrants
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
but if you hear somebody screaming
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
inside the building you can break into
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that house
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay any other question so i guess i i
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
have a real problem with a statute um
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
but we'll start out with do you know any
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
hotel today
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
that has a book or a card system
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
well it depends on what you mean by book
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
well that's what the statute says yeah
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
well when was the statute written sir
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
evidently you just told us 1923.
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
and uh when was it last modified i have
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
no idea
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'll leave that to the attorney
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
general's office but i think it was 70
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
73 something like that
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
but actually if you take a look at the
 
01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.229 align:start position:0%
but actually if you take a look at the
uh

01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
signing when you go to a motel you're
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
signing into a card system you're using
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
your card to get into the place
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
i suppose that would be a justification
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
you're correct sir some modification
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be made right well yeah but
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
even and i said oh well i had put my
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
credit card to look for
 
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.550 align:start position:0%
credit card to look for
incidentals

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
incidentals
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
it might not be my car it could be
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
somebody else's card it could be my
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
parents paid for me ahead of time
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
so that that's not telling you anything
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
other than you have another name that's
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
not that would be illegal you can't they
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
would the hotel would be in violation if
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
they were using that as the name
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think most hotels are in violation
 
01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.750 align:start position:0%
i think most hotels are in violation
today

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.350 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
um

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
would this apply because
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
the way i'm reading it that their book
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
or their
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
card system is now pretty much
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
electronic because i know when you go
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
into a hotel you need a
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
picture id but you cannot rent a room
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah if
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
i you know the conferences that i go to
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
in different states and and uh even here
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
in the state with the knights of
 
01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:50.550 align:start position:0%
in the state with the knights of
columbus

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
columbus
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
when you go in well when you make your
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
reservation you give them the card
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
information that's going to secure the
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
room and then when you show up does that
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
information match the card information
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
is the routine procedure
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
now do we need to put that into law
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
modify this particular chapter in
 
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.390 align:start position:0%
modify this particular chapter in
some

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
manner so that it reflects current
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
business practices and business
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
practices into the future so the
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
language would be open-ended that
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
verification of identity upon
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
blah would be inappropriate
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
is it my
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that you already we
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
already have laws that say that you
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
cannot stay in a room without proper id
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that i think that's
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
more of a business activity
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe i've already ran into
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
this issue we tried to rent a room for
 
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.709 align:start position:0%
this issue we tried to rent a room for
uh

01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
a relative in town they didn't have id
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
they would not rent the room even though
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
we were paying for it she had no id so
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
she could not get a room
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
so she drove home that night
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'm famous for those
 
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.390 align:start position:0%
i'm famous for those
okay

01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
obviously the only other question i have
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
and when i read this definition of
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
lodging house
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
it somewhat implies that if i have two
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
or more rooms or habitually and i don't
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
know what habitual means but if i rent
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
out the my property enough
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
that means i have to uh
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
have signatures from these people who
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
booked online
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
and through a you know through airbnb
 
01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:45.990 align:start position:0%
and through a you know through airbnb
verbo

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
verbo
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
how i don't have any of that
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
well as i said uh
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
open into language that would allow this
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
to go forward into the future for many
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
decades as this bill has
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
set in the back corner for many decades
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate now
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
banning it all outright i will disagree
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
with the constituent that brought this
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
forward uh for the reasons that he will
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
explain but
 
01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:14.390 align:start position:0%
explain but
uh

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
opening the language i think
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
can replace uh
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
the first sentence uh very very
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
easily uh maintain a record
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh verify identity
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
that kind of uh
 
01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:30.629 align:start position:0%
that kind of uh
language

01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
would allow
future

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
record keeping in whatever manner
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
happens to be the most efficient for the
 
01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.229 align:start position:0%
happens to be the most efficient for the
business

01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
as well as give law enforcement the
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
needed access to the information i do
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
think that if law enforcement's going to
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
go in and rummage through the records of
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
who's sleeping in which hotel or cavan
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.350 align:start position:0%
or whatever
uh

01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
they probably should have a reason for
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
doing that rather than
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
not have a reason fair enough thank you
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
all right we'll call on richard khan who
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
the constituent who has a real life
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you ladies and gentlemen of this
 
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.470 align:start position:0%
thank you ladies and gentlemen of this
committee

01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
my name is richard khan i live in hudson
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to cover three main points
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
number one
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
the civil liberties
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
issue number two
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
possible law enforcement point of view
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
and number three what makes it personal
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
before representative allery agreed to
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
submit this bill on my behalf he says
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
i need you to talk to chief avery
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill avery is the chief of police in my
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
hometown of hudson new hampshire
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
the first thing chief avery said to me
 
01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
the first thing chief avery said to me
was

01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
i wasn't aware that there was this law
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
allowing law enforcement to see the
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
hotel registration log whether it's
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
cards or computers doesn't matter
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
on demand
 
01:25:05.679 --> 01:25:06.629 align:start position:0%
on demand
okay

01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
he says when he has to go i think hudson
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
has like two
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
hotels in it
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
and he says when he has to search a
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
business hotel or otherwise
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
his words not mine
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
that he likes to get a warrant because
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
and the prosecutors in court appreciate
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
that because it makes their case in
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's his words okay
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
he said also that he would check with
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
somebody i don't know who he spoke with
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the attorney general's office to see
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
what the compelling law enforcement
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
interest in it was and he has
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
he wasn't able to find out as far as i
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
can tell
 
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.870 align:start position:0%
can tell
okay

01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
number two is the
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
civil liberties issue
 
01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
civil liberties issue
police

01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
should always need a warrant to search
 
01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.709 align:start position:0%
should always need a warrant to search
any

01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
business or
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
private property i heard it mentioned
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
that there's always well what if there's
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
something really bad that happened and
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
they have reason to believe the suspects
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
in this hotel well
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
exigent circumstances i heard that
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
already mentioned
 
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.430 align:start position:0%
already mentioned
now

01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
the third point which is the one that
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
makes it personal to me
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
is where my family came from
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
especially on my dad's side now i know a
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
lot of people compare when they don't
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
like something and they want to make a
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
point that compared to the nazis
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
well my father was born and raised in
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
what became nazi germany
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
i used to ask him
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
and my late uncle walter when were you
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
first aware you had to leave the country
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i am going to tie this back to this
 
01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.030 align:start position:0%
and i am going to tie this back to this
bill

01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
for them the defining moment was 1936 my
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
dad was in some kind of children's camp
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
and he remember seeing signs around
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
germany uden unervunch meaning jews not
 
01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.470 align:start position:0%
germany uden unervunch meaning jews not
welcome

01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
my uncle walter
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
when he
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh he remembers in july of 1936
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
riding in the back seat of the car with
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
my grandparents
 
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.629 align:start position:0%

uh he served in the u.s navy in world
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
war ii uh he's 95 years old so
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he could not be here to
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
confirm this but
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
he said that it wasn't german soldiers
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
that had come to the hotel it was the ss
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%

my interest in this bill
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
is wanting to make sure that
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
we are not going to
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
fall into that trap well
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
trusting the law enforcement to use the
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
proper restraint and getting the warrant
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
unless they really have exegen

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.350 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm done i'll take any
questions

we are not there
yet

01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%

representative mackel here
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you chairman what would your
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
opinion be
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
on a voter id
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
in order to vote
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
is that impinging
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
in that case if we look
 
01:36:08.639 --> 01:36:11.350 align:start position:0%
in that case if we look
at

01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
the community's right
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
to have a fair
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
point of order please mr chairman i'm
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
wondering what um producing an id
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
a voter for to vote has to do with this
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.629 align:start position:0%
particular bill
uh

01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
which has to do with a warrant for
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
i just want to get you to clarify that
 
01:36:33.679 --> 01:36:34.870 align:start position:0%
i just want to get you to clarify that
he

01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:35.830 align:start position:0%
he
he

01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
took liberties okay with his testimony
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
and so we're just
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
playing it out because he opened the
 
01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.430 align:start position:0%
playing it out because he opened the
door

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
door
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you certainly and i welcome
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%

a fair and honest election
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
in a republic a democracy quasi
 
01:36:54.639 --> 01:36:56.790 align:start position:0%
in a republic a democracy quasi
democracy

01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
is essential
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
the identification for that is minimal
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
it is free for the asking
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to have proof of
 
01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.109 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to have proof of
residence

01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
residence
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
that is your responsibility which you
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
accept freely as a citizen and if you
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%

everybody knows they give a lot of
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
information away when they're on the
 
01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.229 align:start position:0%

that
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%

in this discussion
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
it is similar
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.830 align:start position:0%

voluntarily you've given it up
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
and you've done so under the internet
 
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.950 align:start position:0%

we have
guaranteed

01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
guaranteed
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
rights that originated
 
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
from our maker
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
that so-called natural rights we
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
voluntarily give up some
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
to participate in our community
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%

when we vote

period
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.709 align:start position:0%
we are
extremely

01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
free and forgiving state
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
it would be wonderful
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
great on that note thank you very much
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%

yes can you hear me sorry yeah uh money
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
for the record mike summers new
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire president ceo of new hampshire
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
lodging and restaurant association
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh we aren't really taking a bill a
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
position on the bill as written um
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
frankly we would leave it to you all as
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
our policy leaders makers uh to
 
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.070 align:start position:0%
our policy leaders makers uh to
determine

01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
determine
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
how this should play out
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh but since uh this bill opens the door
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
in this section of the statute we have
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
another concern which chairman hunt
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
actually alluded to earlier which is the
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
section that refers to shall keep a book
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
a card system calls each guest to sign
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
there in his own legal name or name by
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
which he is no commonly known said book
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
a card system etc uh frankly in today's
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
day and age hotel commerce you guys
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
already kind of discussed this uh with
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know the pandemic and contactless
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
payment contactless check-in uh in some
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
hotels in some states you don't even go
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
to the front desk or talk to anybody you
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
essentially get your checking in your
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
phone you run up to the door you tap the
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
door door pops open
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
so ultimately we'd like to see that kind
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
of removed
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
and to representative ulrie's testimony
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
earlier this section of the statute
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated since 1973 so i
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
think it's time that we did something we
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have a clear
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation of what that should be
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
but we're certainly happy to work with
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
the committee to figure out what that
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was asked or
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
statements made earlier about having an
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
id to rent that is more of a business
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
decision than required by statute in the
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire but that business
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
it stems from the fact that you don't
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to be
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
tricked into allowing somebody to rent
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
who's using false identification
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
or no identification false credit cards
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
those so identity theft and those kinds
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
of scenarios so i don't believe anywhere
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
in statutes required in new hampshire
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
but most businesses do require it as a
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
as a protection of the business
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
and since we're here and going through
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
all the old statutes i thought i'd throw
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
a couple other options on the table for
 
01:43:18.239 --> 01:43:19.030 align:start position:0%
a couple other options on the table for
you

01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
also within section 353
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
section 3a posting of rental rates
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
requires that you have your minimum of
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
maximum room rates posted inside the
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
hotel room that was last updated in 1979
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
and frankly i think most hotels in the
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
state are in violation of that part of
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
the statute as well simply because the
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
rates change almost daily at this point
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
it's all online we've all seen it so it
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
becomes kind of a moot point
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
the other section i would throw out
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
there is 353.5 which is under signs
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated since 1959
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
which also requires that if you are
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to post the room rate outside on
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
the side of the road you have to have
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
your minimum and maximum prices and it
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
has to be of a size that can be read by
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
the traveling public uh so
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
again if you're going to open the can of
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
worms we're going to go all in on this
 
01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
worms we're going to go all in on this
so

01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
i thought i would
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
i would offer those to the committee for
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
consideration uh i'm certainly happy to
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions you may have
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
but um it's here we figured we would ask
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
so is there anything in the actual rsa
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
353 that you would think we should keep
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
or should we just repeal the whole thing
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think there are some sections we
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
should keep yes
 
01:44:31.119 --> 01:44:31.990 align:start position:0%
should keep yes
um

01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
i could read the list if you like but uh
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll look at it save that for
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
another day yes
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative below
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
um you represent the restaurant lodging
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
association were there a little closer
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
to mike with their specific um hotels or
 
01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.350 align:start position:0%
to mike with their specific um hotels or
um

01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
bed and breakfast owners that
 
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.750 align:start position:0%
bed and breakfast owners that
phoned

01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
phoned
 
01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.950 align:start position:0%
phoned
you

01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:57.830 align:start position:0%
you
yeah

01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill yes thank you
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
for the question representative so yes i
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
have been contacted by a few members and
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
again this is kind of a side effect of
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
the pandemic frankly
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
but we do have some facilities that are
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
either have switched over to are in the
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
process of switching over to that
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
contactless check-in payment system so
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
they found themselves in a bit of a
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
conundrum about well if they don't
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually come to the front desk and talk
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
to anybody how do i get them to sign
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
something because we're of adopted
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
technologies in order to deliberately
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
avoid that that transaction head
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
scenario so i did get a few property
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
owners that had called me and asked
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions about that unfortunately when
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
we had these conversations in the fall
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
we'd already missed filing deadlines so
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't really take it up but when we
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
found this bill had been conveniently
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
filed we thought we would jump in on the
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
coattails so to speak
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you sir for
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
taking our questions uh aside a little
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
so aside from all of the uh out of date
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
language of the overall section
 
01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:02.470 align:start position:0%
language of the overall section
the

01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically has
 
01:46:05.119 --> 01:46:06.470 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically has
bolded

01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
bolded
 
01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.830 align:start position:0%
bolded
that

01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would require a warrant
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
in which probable cause has been
 
01:46:12.719 --> 01:46:14.470 align:start position:0%
in which probable cause has been
attested

01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
attested
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
lodging owners lodging keepers whatever
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
you want to call them
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
that this law would pertain to
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
in having some record of who is on the
 
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.189 align:start position:0%
in having some record of who is on the
property

01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then upon presentation of a warrant
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
providing that information to law
 
01:46:37.119 --> 01:46:38.310 align:start position:0%
providing that information to law
enforcement

01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
because that's that's the crux of the
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
bill regardless of all the other changes
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
that might need to be made this bill
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with providing a
 
01:46:45.199 --> 01:46:47.510 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with providing a
warrant

01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement or excuse me law
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement requiring a warrant
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative and as i
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
said at my opening statement we don't
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
haven't really taken a position on
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
requiring a warrant we obviously will
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
work with law enforcement we value their
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
partnership uh we certainly have seen um
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i think you're going to hear in
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up testimony we've certainly seen
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
that there has been human trafficking
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
and other kinds of issues that have
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
started to develop into new hampshire a
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
little bit so we certainly have some
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about you know law enforcement
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement's ability to react to that
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
again we leave that to you all as our
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
esteemed policy makers to figure out
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
what that should look like and what that
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
balance should be
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
but going back to the keeping of the
 
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.990 align:start position:0%
but going back to the keeping of the
record

01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i most businesses would keep it anyway
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
but i do think that there should be some
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
record kept by the business for obvious
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
reasons right um so that in the event
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
that enforcement has to do some sort of
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
investigation three months later that
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
there is some record that needs to be
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
that can be reviewed to track people's
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh progress uh in the event that they're
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know chasing a felon or whatever it
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
but beyond that um you know most
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
businesses would keep the record simply
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to need
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
records of these transactions simply for
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
irs purposes and other areas that they
 
01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:01.109 align:start position:0%
irs purposes and other areas that they
they're

01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
required to report or maintain but um
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
but beyond that we're not really
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
adopting a position on the law
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement aspect of it we obviously
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative terry
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
on a lighter note i trust as we draw to
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
the conclusion of
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
the q a on your testimony thank you for
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
your testimony and with respect to the
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
broader concerns that you've raised with
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
respect to section 353 i would just like
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
to thank you for enlightening me as to
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
the possible reason why and i believe
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
this is not only the case in new
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire but other states
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
i have a firm recollection of
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
taking a motel room for the night
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
for a rather reasonable rate of 79 or 99
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
but when i looked at the back of the
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
door inside of the back of the door it
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
indicated that the maximum room rate was
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
over a thousand dollars
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much i think i've got
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
it now
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
will be called the wreck rate
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
well and if i can respond i think that's
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
really the problem right you you
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
post that on the back of a door and
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
frankly you have to put in you know it
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
might be 99 and it could be 2500 a night
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
depending on what's going on so and
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
hotels end up putting these wildly
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
astronomical numbers because they don't
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
want to get caught in this thing where
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
well you know that's higher or lower
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
than the posted rate et cetera so
 
01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:25.910 align:start position:0%
than the posted rate et cetera so
um

01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
the one other thing i was going to add
 
01:49:27.599 --> 01:49:28.390 align:start position:0%
the one other thing i was going to add
was

01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.109 align:start position:0%
was
the

01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
discussion around id um you know really
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
a big part of the requirement of the
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
idea is a credit card right so you use
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
your credit card to
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
reserve the room but then you're coming
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
in you're actually going to pay with a
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
credit card you're wanting the id to
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
back up the fact that you are actually
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
the person that has rights to use that
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
credit card so anyway i defer thank you
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative vargas
 
01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
uh representative vargas
yes

01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um for your testimony you have
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
to pull close to mike close
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
oh can you hear me now yes okay thank
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony i'm
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
curious are there any protocols today
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of in in the
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
association um that if a police officer
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
or any law enforcement agent comes in
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
and asks for this information
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
what what what's the protocol today is
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
this just information that gets released
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
i know i can't even find out you know
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
like if my husband's upstairs so i'm
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
just a little curious about that so
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
currently again under the current
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
statute if uh an officer comes in and
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
requests it we're gonna uh share with
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
them information we
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
most of our businesses would do it in a
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
limited fashion and usually it would be
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
a case of and i would defer to obviously
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's etc but usually they would
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
come in and ask about a specific
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
individual they're not coming in to just
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
see the entirety of who's in the hotel
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
um but usually that information is
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
shared because i think most hoteliers in
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state understand that they're
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
required to share that information with
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
okay brian
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
nukem we saved the best for last here
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
for us to tell us why
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
why you really are in opposition to this
 
01:51:07.679 --> 01:51:21.990 align:start position:0%
why you really are in opposition to this

place to stay most people utilize them
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
for reasons such as visiting local

01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
most reasons uh people use hotels
 
01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:18.550 align:start position:0%
most reasons uh people use hotels
for

01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
pleasant activities
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
hotels however
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
have people that visit for
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
more menacing reasons hotels provide an
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
attractive place for drug dealing drug
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
using prostitution human trafficking
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
sexual exploitation of children white
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
collar crimes fugitives because the
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
hotels offer a place of anonymity
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk a little bit about
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
in which we inspect the
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
hotel logs
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of times we're dealing with
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
criminals who have arrest warrants who
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
are on the run from crimes that could
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
range from the most petty to the most
 
01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:56.709 align:start position:0%
range from the most petty to the most
serious

01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
when we are investigating someone that's
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
wanted for a crime we may go talk to
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
somebody and they may say hey joe is
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
staying over at a hotel in manchester
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
so we would go to a hotel in manchester
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
and we would request to see
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
you know the guest log book to see if
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
his name is on it however when you don't
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
have the specific hotel that they're
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
staying at
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to get a warrant
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
to follow up with that case
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
therefore we're going to all the hotels
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
in manchester or merrimack or nashua or
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be so it's a very fluid
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
trend right now is
 
01:53:35.679 --> 01:53:36.550 align:start position:0%
trend right now is
people

01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.589 align:start position:0%
people
will

01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
rent hotel rooms either under their name
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
or under a friend's name
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
and they will set up shop to sell drugs
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
or do other illegal activity
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
hotels are a busy place so the uptick in
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
traffic really isn't suspicious most
 
01:53:50.719 --> 01:53:51.589 align:start position:0%
traffic really isn't suspicious most
times

01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
and they do that because it's not as
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
suspicious as if they were doing it at
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
their own house where the neighbors
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
would call or other residents down the
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
street would call if something was out
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
of place
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
often these activities are happening
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
in a room right next to a family that's
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
trying to enjoy a vacation or a business
 
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:09.350 align:start position:0%
trying to enjoy a vacation or a business
traveler

01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
one example that
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of comes to light that just
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
a few people got arrested in milford new
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire for possession of
 
01:54:19.199 --> 01:54:20.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire for possession of
methamphetamine

01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
the investigators over there
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
found out that someone that we the
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county sheriff's office had
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
a warrant for was their supplier and
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
they were staying at the at a hotel in
 
01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.910 align:start position:0%
they were staying at the at a hotel in
manchester

01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
they provided us with the hotel which
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
was great
 
01:54:34.639 --> 01:54:35.350 align:start position:0%
was great
we

01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
investigators went over to the hotel we
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
spoke with the
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
innkeeper who was very pleasant
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
and we provided them with the name that
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
we were looking for that name was not on
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
the list she showed us the whole list
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
and we were able to identify an
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
associate of his from the list and we
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
were able to ultimately go up knock on
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
the door arrest them take them into
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
custody and we end up finding a large
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
amount of methamphetamine and some other
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
illegal items right that's another a
 
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.589 align:start position:0%
illegal items right that's another a
positive

01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
positive
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
kind of getting down the the
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
the sexual exploitation exploitation
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
aspect of it
 
01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
aspect of it
um

01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with the internet
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
crimes against children task force we
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
have a an officer assigned to it
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of cases with them
 
01:55:22.239 --> 01:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of cases with them
and

01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
over the past year there have been
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
several cases where an adult has
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
made arrangements to meet up with a
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
minor in a hotel room now when these
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
cases come in they're very very fluid
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
they're very quickly
 
01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:35.589 align:start position:0%
they're very quickly
developing

01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
so we were able to identify the hotel
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
that they had planned to meet this miner
 
01:55:41.199 --> 01:55:41.990 align:start position:0%
that they had planned to meet this miner
at

01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:42.950 align:start position:0%
at
and

01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
we were able to go in
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
ask if their name was there they showed
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
us the guest log book we confirmed that
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
this person was actually serious about
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
following through with his act
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately that person got arrested at
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
the hotel but it's just another rung in
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
confirming that this person is really
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
serious about what's happening
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
human trafficking as was spoken about
 
01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:03.910 align:start position:0%
human trafficking as was spoken about
before

01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.030 align:start position:0%
before
is

01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
predominantly a major problem at local
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
hotels and when i say in hillsborough
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
county we deal with nashua merrimack
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
bedford and manchester merrimack i don't
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
know if any of you are from that area
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
had a tremendous problem with um the
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
drug and prostitution um it started
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
about two years ago when the there's a
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
correct people wrong i think there's
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
four hotels that are there and they were
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
basically dropping their rates to see
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
who could get the most people on there
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
and sell out which is fine but it
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
attracts a different clientele when that
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
happens so
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
we were able to uncover human
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
trafficking cases going on there and
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was simply by going in there and
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the list and saying hey
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
a name popped out to us that we know is
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
a sex worker
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for us
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
as law enforcement to go knock on that
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
person's door and say hey are you okay
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
they may be in there doing nothing right
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
now but
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes we've offered services and
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
they've taken us up on those services to
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
get them out of that situation they're
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
not there willingly but they are there
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
because they either have an addiction
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
problem or they're they're they're
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's they're forced to be there for some
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
other reason for money or whoever has
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
control over them
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
but for them to know that we're around
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
checking on them offering them services
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's the best that we can and you know
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
there have been people that we have
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
gotten you know out of that lifestyle
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying all of them i'm saying we
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
do our best to do that that's a success
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
in in my book and by simply looking at a
 
01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.790 align:start position:0%
in in my book and by simply looking at a
list

01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
to see who's on there to prevent crime
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
is is very important and i want to take
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to talk about what the
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
next step is in that so if we we
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
identify that illegal activity is going
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
on in joe's room
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
um we're going to get a search warrant
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
to do that we're not going to nilly
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
willy go in there we're not going to
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
blow down the door and do that we're
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to get our ducks in a row but that
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
list is certainly a
 
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's the first level in establishing
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
your probable cause that crime is going
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
on or that there could be something
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
illegal going on or or whatever we are
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to put this in front of a judge
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
after that
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
to to go to the next step
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if anyone here has ever
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
applied for a search warrant or dealt
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
with that it's a very cumbersome process
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
it takes
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
hours to write
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
even on the smallest case and then we do
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
have a new electronic system that's uh
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
supposedly more efficient but
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
typically the more emerging situations
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
are put to the the top of the list to
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
get signed by a judge so on a basic
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
search warrant for a hotel guest blog
 
01:58:35.599 --> 01:58:36.470 align:start position:0%
search warrant for a hotel guest blog
book

01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
book
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
that would assume that we would get it
 
01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
back between 8 and 48 hours depending on
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
when the when the judge would would sign
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
that okay and that's no fault of them
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a busy nature and that's
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
happens um there are many sophisticated
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
organizations that operate up and down
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
the east coast i'm sure you you have
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
read about in the paper watching the
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
news they travel up here they go to your
 
01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
local gyms they steal your wallets they
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
go to you and then they take your wallet
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
and your checks and they go
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
cash them at the banks
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
that is a huge part of this white collar
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
industry that's staying at these hotels
 
01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we've had great success when
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
patrolmen are on the street and they're
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
going they're checking the hotels
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
because hey we're getting hit with these
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
forgeries and thefts they check the
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
hotels they see a name on the list
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's associated with one of these
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
organizations and they're able to either
 
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
set up surveillance make an arrest if
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
that person has a warrant or
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
prevent future crime from happening
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
um i'll bring it up and this is kind of
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
a public safety issue is there was a
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
recent double homicide in bedford new
 
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:36.950 align:start position:0%
recent double homicide in bedford new
hampshire

01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
less than a year ago eight months ago i
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
was there
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
those guest log
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
logs were absolutely crucial in
 
01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:45.030 align:start position:0%
logs were absolutely crucial in
identifying

01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
the victims in that case they were
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
crucial in identifying people that were
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
not involved in that case and making
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
sure people were accounted for
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
that was a tremendous help in getting
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
those people out of that hotel safely
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
and effectively and making sure that we
 
01:59:58.800 --> 01:59:59.669 align:start position:0%
and effectively and making sure that we
weren't

01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
looking for someone else that was
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
potentially injured or harmed and that
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
was a very sensitive crime scene and i
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
can tell you we were there for days
 
02:00:07.119 --> 02:00:07.990 align:start position:0%
can tell you we were there for days
and

02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
that is one of the best stories that
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
that i can portray about the the use of
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
those those log books
 
02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.229 align:start position:0%
those those log books
um

02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
the police shooting that happened in
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
manchester about a year and a half ago
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
at the hotel there
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
that was crucial in getting people out
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the out of the hotels to get them out
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the way but also who we were dealing
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
with when you're looking at the logs and
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying you know joe um
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
joe rented the room
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
but we know that joe has the following
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
friends and there's four people in there
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
we think that these people are are
 
02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
potentially there so it gives us an
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
advantage on knowing who who's who's in
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
there when we're dealing with the
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
criminal element and law enforcement
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
aren't we're not just going to the
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
hotels to
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
just say hey who's in the room who's
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
here who's there who's staying here
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
we all operate with policies and
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
procedures in a professional way and
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
transparency these days is very
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
important to everybody and it's
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
important to citizens it's important to
 
02:00:58.639 --> 02:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
important to citizens it's important to
us

02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
when we
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
interact with the innkeepers that are
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh with people at their
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
hotel it's a very positive experience
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times it's having a cup of
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
coffee with them and they're talking
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
about hey these are the problems we're
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
seeing we see this guy coming in here
 
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
every every week or you know a lot of
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
people lording outside you know we may
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation hey maybe you
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
should put some some more lighting
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
outside a couple have a couple places
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
have done that
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
but it's a very positive experience
 
02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:27.270 align:start position:0%
but it's a very positive experience
between

02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.870 align:start position:0%
between
the

02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
innkeepers and ourself
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
the current laws are written allows for
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to inspect a book
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
or guest book without a warrant this is
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
a very
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
effective investigative tool that is
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
often used to combat illegal activity if
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
the laws change and law enforcement is
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
required to get a search warrant to
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
review guest logs this will be a major
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
hindrance in combating illegal activity
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
allowing criminals even more anonymity
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
public safety would suffer if law
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement needed a search warrant for
 
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett has a question
 
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for coming um
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
forward and talking to us about real
 
02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:04.790 align:start position:0%
forward and talking to us about real
live

02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
live
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
instances of when it's necessary for law
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement to access these log books
 
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:10.790 align:start position:0%
enforcement to access these log books
um

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
would it be your your testimony that
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
most innkeepers
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
want your help to get people
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
that are breaking the law out of their
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
establishment absolutely that's their
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
goal and that's our goal they don't want
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
to have someone that's going to be a
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
problem in their hotel that could be
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
affecting other guests or committing
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
crimes while they're there maybe
 
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
damaging the the rooms themselves so
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
they are very positive in that in that
 
02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
they are very positive in that in that
manner

02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
for the question you mean
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um so
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
it would it would be your testimony that
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is something regarding public
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
safety we you're not looking
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
as has been heard this morning about a
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
quasi democracy that
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
stepping on individual rights of our
 
02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
citizens that's correct are our officers
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
investigators and i can speak for
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
investigators throughout the state and
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
especially hillsborough county is
 
02:03:07.350 --> 02:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
caseloads are so high right now um that
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
nobody really has time to just go out
 
02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
and check hotel lists on a whim to be
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
like hey we're going to check hotel
 
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
lists and see what's what's going on
 
02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
here today it's more of a targeted
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
a targeted issue you're there because
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
you have a a case a reason
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
and you're following the procedures and
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want people to think that we are
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
going to the hotel hotel looking at
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
their log and then we're going to kick
 
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
their door and that's that's 100 percent
 
02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:32.229 align:start position:0%
their door and that's that's 100 percent
false

02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
false
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
we follow the same
 
02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations as it would be to
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
get a search warrant to establish
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
probable cause to further that case
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
we're not about
 
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
violating anyone violating anyone's
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
rights there because i wouldn't want my
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative terry
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:52.629 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
um

02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
i just want to essentially ask you the
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
same question that i asked the previous
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh individual who testified part of it
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and i want to understand
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
that um and have you have you confirmed
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
what i think i'm hearing and and that is
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
that in response to the question um
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
things are different
 
02:04:13.199 --> 02:04:14.149 align:start position:0%
things are different
here

02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
different now they're not like those
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
situations that happened in
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
germany in the 1930s and 40s
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
in the soviet union under joseph stalin
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
in china under mao
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
and questionably in some other countries
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps even today
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
that there's something about what the
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
moral fabric
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
and culture of the united states that
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
this need not be a concern now
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
is is is that is that partly what i'm
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
hearing could you speak to that please
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
um sure
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
i should have paid attention a lot more
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
in school uh when you when you brought
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
up those names and stuff
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
my wife is a teacher and should be
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
ashamed um
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
but i uh
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
i do understand where you're going with
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that we live in a world
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
right now where police transparency is
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
on the forefront of what's happening and
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think that every department in the
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
state has
 
02:05:09.119 --> 02:05:10.149 align:start position:0%
state has
put

02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
put
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
in place
 
02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:13.430 align:start position:0%
in place
safeguards

02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
safeguards
 
02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:14.390 align:start position:0%
safeguards
to

02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
accomplish certain measures and means
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
for an operation get approved i have to
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
send it to my boss and he approves it um
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
it is different now because
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
crime is so rapidly revolving and it's
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
getting so technical where you could
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
like the gentleman before me said you
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
could sign into your hotel room with
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
just your phone and then you can pop
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
over to maybe rent another room in
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
another hotel with your phone so you're
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
double insulating yourself with a sense
 
02:05:44.709 --> 02:05:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
rep representative
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for coming
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
and testifying for us uh you mentioned
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
transparency uh
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
would an alternative to this bill uh
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
would you accept an alternative to this
 
02:05:59.040 --> 02:05:59.830 align:start position:0%
would you accept an alternative to this
bill

02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
that would require
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
the police to notify the public
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
when they ask for
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
the records of a of a hotel some kind of
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
disclosure maybe on the department's
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
website that they asked the date officer
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
so i think if i understand your your
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
question um that would be a uh more of a
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory um protocol
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
as uh maybe on a quarterly basis or is
 
02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
that like a daily basis i'm not sure
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
what you're where you're how
 
02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:29.750 align:start position:0%
what you're where you're how
fluid

02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
fluid
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned transparency and that was
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know very important these days
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
it would be transparent of the
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
department if they would notify the
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
public when they went to a hotel
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
and asked to see the records you know
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
we would have some transparency in that
 
02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:46.390 align:start position:0%
we would have some transparency in that
request

02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
um i would have to speak with uh some of
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police on that so that we
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
could have a better um understanding of
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
where we're all at collectively but a
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
police log would show that we we were
 
02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
police log would show that we we were
there

02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh answering our questions
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
lieutenant um
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i really have more than one
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
question in
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
in all of this but you you use in your
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that the there's an element of
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
people that utilize hotels for darker
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
and more menacing reasons
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh that can be said about just about
 
02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:22.149 align:start position:0%
uh that can be said about just about
everything

02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:07:22.159 --> 02:07:23.350 align:start position:0%
everything
uh

02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.390 align:start position:0%
uh
people

02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
criminals are criminals they're bad guys
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter where they commit
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
their crimes or where they try to hide
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
out and so does the fact that crimes may
 
02:07:34.069 --> 02:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
occur at a hotel supersede due process
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
of law rules of evidence and civil
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
rights and with that we've been
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
conflating laws or excuse me crimes in
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
progress versus looking for a suspect in
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
a criminal activity that has occurred in
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
the past and so no one wants no one
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
wants the bad guys to get away with
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
their with their crimes we all want the
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
bad guys off the streets and your job is
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
to get them off the streets but we also
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
have a judicial system in this country
 
02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:00.709 align:start position:0%
have a judicial system in this country
rights

02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
even the criminal has the right of due
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
process of law right that's correct so
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
that that requires certain actions on
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
your part
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure the bad guy goes
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
to jail so that the evidence that you
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
collect is within the rules of evidence
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
and you've you've dotted all the eyes
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
and crossed all the t's right you want
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
to put them away you don't want to get
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
out on technicality
 
02:08:20.639 --> 02:08:23.030 align:start position:0%
out on technicality
so

02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
does the fact that these crimes occur at
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
hotels supersede due process of law and
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that you need to get a warrant
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
and does and does a warrant requiring a
 
02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:33.589 align:start position:0%
and does and does a warrant requiring a
warrant

02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
interfere or prevent the innkeeper from
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
volunteering information
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
so that's gonna be a multiple part
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
answer to your question so
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
everyone here has constitutional rights
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
and no one wants to get them violated
 
02:08:46.709 --> 02:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
because we want these cases to go forth
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
without a hiccup we don't want anything
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
thrown out on a technicality as you say
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
when a hotel room or house is searched
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
whether someone could give consent to
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
search a hotel room they could give
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
consent to search their residence that's
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
not a big deal however
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
if we apply for a search warrant we
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
established probable cause we
 
02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:07.599 align:start position:0%
established that it's been reviewed by a
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
neutral and detached magistrate or judge
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
and that has been put forth signed
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
either either signed or not signed they
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
may say we don't have it sometimes but
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's signed that gives us the
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
authorization to go ahead and search
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
your room i think what we're talking
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
here is simply looking at a
 
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:22.950 align:start position:0%
here is simply looking at a
list

02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
of people that are staying in a hotel
 
02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
room that are paying a room and board
 
02:09:29.189 --> 02:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
tax to stay there i think that that is
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
no different than me looking up your
 
02:09:31.199 --> 02:09:32.390 align:start position:0%
no different than me looking up your
address

02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
online on a vision appraisal or the tax
 
02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:36.069 align:start position:0%
online on a vision appraisal or the tax

02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
you you talked about a a
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
policeman walking down the street and
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
just walking into the hotel and looking
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
at the registry did i misunderstand you
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
that you said that has happened
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
just randomly looked at a registry um
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it has happened but typically
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
they're there for for some for some
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
reason i can talk about the the
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
sophisticated white collar crew that
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
comes up um typically it starts with um
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
you may have a bulk theft at
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
lowe's in bedford and you know it's out
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
of state plates and you may go over to
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
the hotel to see if that car is matching
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
it you may go into there to see if um
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
someone's staying in there that matches
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
a previous um so how often or do you
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
have you heard any anecdotal stories
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
where one where a hotel said no
 
02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
where one where a hotel said no
no

02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
so really this law even though it exists
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
has never been used
 
02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.310 align:start position:0%
has never been used
maybe

02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
well the law is used every time we go in
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
there no i'm not saying the law is not
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
used because you're not
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
enforcing you're not saying due to this
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
rsa 355 333 you need to show me
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
your registry
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
you're just saying is you don't have a
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
problem going into any hotel
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
and having them show you the registry
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
well i can tell you that about 18 years
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
ago i did have an issue at a hotel where
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
someone was like oh i don't know if i
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
can give you those and i cited the this
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
law that we're talking about today
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
and they didn't had no idea about it so
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
they were educated on that on that law
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
but i think that all the innkeepers and
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
the corporate chains
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
have informed and trained their
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
employees on the rights that are
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
respected to each state that they're
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
operating in so well
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
and that gets me what really scares me
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
about this bill is that most of us don't
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
even know it exists
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
and my fear is that
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a book or card
 
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.750 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a book or card
system

02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
i guess you're looking when you say the
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
registry at this point you're looking to
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
say is do you have a list of all your
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
people who are in the hotel tonight
 
02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
people who are in the hotel tonight
and

02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
i have a vacation rental
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm lucky to have just the person who
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
booked it
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know anybody else is in the
 
02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:52.629 align:start position:0%
i don't know anybody else is in the
place

02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
so am i in violation of this statute
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're renting it out for
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
more than uh
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
more than the the two days a consistent
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
basis two rooms in less than a week yeah
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and vacation rental yeah you
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
know you've heard about the vacation
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
rentals right in the state here that's
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
kind of a controversy
 
02:12:10.239 --> 02:12:11.430 align:start position:0%
kind of a controversy
yeah

02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
so so we're all in violation but uh but
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying is that so what is a
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
hotel does a hotel literally turn the
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
computer around and let you look screen
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
through the list but what are you
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
getting from a hotel
 
02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
typically what we get is a redacted
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
version we get they'll print it out and
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
they usually eliminate all the credit
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
card information and all that other
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
stuff and you get a list of of names and
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
however format that they're putting them
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
out or sometimes they'll just let you
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
that does seem a little scary about
 
02:12:44.550 --> 02:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
privacy issues but um
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
having the idea that
 
02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can uh
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
to do this you've never had except this
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
one case where a person said i didn't
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
know this law existed but in every other
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
case most people said yeah i have no
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
problems showing you or trying to help
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
you and give you all the information you
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
need is that correct that's correct okay
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
so we we have to figure out how do we
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
make it so that the person who doesn't
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
protect them from not
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
violating the law and having you say oh
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
by the way you just violated the statute
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have a list
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
task for this committee to to research i
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
think that there is a lot of work ahead
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
on the vacation end of it with the the
 
02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
airbnbs and the and the the rental if
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
you have a house at the lake that you're
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
renting on a pretty regular basis on you
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
know during certain months but you're
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
not renting on other months i think that
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
maybe that should be subdivided out from
 
02:13:42.629 --> 02:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
this into into something else because i
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
think that that what you're talking
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
about is it's a very it's a very real
 
02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
issue that's going on because of of the
 
02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know where technology is with
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
airbnbs and rentals i think that that's
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
something that maybe should be
 
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
segregated out because it's not as
 
02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
complex well i'm just saying but you
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
only have one name
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
you have the person who booked the room
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
there could be four or five people in
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
that room
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
then we would have to do our due
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
diligence to to find out if there was a
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
crime committed or if that's even what
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
 
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
at that end we simply would have the one
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
room the one name that's on it but
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's where that first investigative
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
step takes place that we would have to
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
further our investigation from there
 
02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:19.750 align:start position:0%
further our investigation from there
okay

02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
if needed if needed representative
 
02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:24.870 align:start position:0%
if needed if needed representative
herbert

02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
if we passed the law for example that
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
said that uh you under you cannot ask
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
actually ask for a list
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
or somebody says well i don't have the
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
list anyway because i don't have to have
 
02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:36.790 align:start position:0%
list anyway because i don't have to have
one

02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh would that hinder
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
your ability to enforce the law that
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
would significantly hinder it
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
so as i understand um you could ask for
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
the list and you would see all the names
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
as well as the name that you'd be
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:01.030 --> 02:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
which leads to my question
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
i i guess i i never realized that i do
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
not have an expectation
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
of privacy when i register at a hotel or
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
a motel
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
that it's a transaction between me and
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
the motel and the hotel owner
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
because hypothetically law enforcement
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
could come in
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
and ask to see a list upon which my name
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
would appear whether i'm the person of
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
interest or not
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
under current law and this is to
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt's point about you know do
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
people even know that this exists i
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
guess i'm i i'm asking you to confirm
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
that that i do that the same expectation
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
of privacy and constitutional rights
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
that are extended to me
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
under whatever amendment it is i can't
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
remember the about the
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
right to
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
search and seizure
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
without a warrant in the constitution
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
in the section we know is the bill of
 
02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:55.270 align:start position:0%
in the section we know is the bill of
rights

02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
when i when i'm temporarily residing in
 
02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:00.310 align:start position:0%
when i when i'm temporarily residing in
a

02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
place of public lodging that expectation
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
of privacy it does not exist any longer
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
under current law in new hampshire
 
02:16:07.119 --> 02:16:08.550 align:start position:0%
under current law in new hampshire
correct

02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560 align:start position:0%

of weights and measures which is under
 
03:19:59.910 --> 03:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture markets
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
and food
 
03:20:03.349 --> 03:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
i am here to speak in support of house
 
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
bill 1249
 
03:20:07.830 --> 03:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
this is a housekeeping item that gives
 
03:20:11.110 --> 03:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
clarity to two scale categories and
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
includes two definitions that give
 
03:20:15.190 --> 03:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
additional clarity to the proposed
 
03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:16.550 align:start position:0%
additional clarity to the proposed
changes

03:20:16.550 --> 03:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:20:18.790 --> 03:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
the term analytical balance in our
 
03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
current statute is vague as to what
 
03:20:24.389 --> 03:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
category of scale is referenced
 
03:20:26.790 --> 03:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
since analytical is a term most often
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
used in a laboratory setting
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
the scale categories in rsa 438 10a are
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
used to determine how commercially used
 
03:20:39.190 --> 03:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
devices are licensed with our division
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
this housekeeping item will clear up any
 
03:20:43.750 --> 03:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguity by changing the term
 
03:20:46.870 --> 03:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
analytical to precision
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
defining precision and adding additional
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
language to the 100 pounds or less
 
03:20:55.349 --> 03:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
category to include the words other than
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
precision scales so each scale category
 
03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:08.950 --> 03:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's really simple it's
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
straightforward okay so you want to tell
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
us what kind of scales we're talking
 
03:21:15.910 --> 03:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
about just give us an idea
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
what ball park are we in here for the
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
precision category we're talking about
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
any of the scales that are used in
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
buying or selling
 
03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
precious metals
 
03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes people use those same scales
 
03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
to sell herbs
 
03:21:36.630 --> 03:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
expensive teas
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the kind of scale that
 
03:21:39.750 --> 03:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
03:21:42.229 --> 03:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
so what happened was in
 
03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the statute can you get a little
 
03:21:45.910 --> 03:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
closer to my sure
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
one of the categories um
 
03:21:49.439 --> 03:21:52.150 align:start position:0%
one of the categories um
says

03:21:52.150 --> 03:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
a hundred pounds or less for that
 
03:21:54.960 --> 03:21:56.469 align:start position:0%
a hundred pounds or less for that
category

03:21:56.469 --> 03:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
category
 
03:21:56.479 --> 03:21:58.309 align:start position:0%
category
so

03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
03:22:02.469 --> 03:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
assumed that that included any of our
 
03:22:05.670 --> 03:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
gram or metric scales
 
03:22:09.750 --> 03:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
we have special equipment that we use to
 
03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
to audit those precision scales
 
03:22:13.359 --> 03:22:14.790 align:start position:0%
to audit those precision scales
and

03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:18.710 --> 03:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
the analytical balance term does not
 
03:22:21.910 --> 03:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
properly reflect those scales because
 
03:22:21.920 --> 03:22:23.190 align:start position:0%
properly reflect those scales because
analytical

03:22:23.190 --> 03:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
analytical
 
03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
and analytical balance is more often
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
used in a laboratory setting
 
03:22:29.349 --> 03:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
but these are scales that are actually
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay oh my gosh all right
 
03:22:39.030 --> 03:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
we'll start here and we'll go all the
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
way around representative terry you're
 
03:22:42.630 --> 03:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
up thank you so as i i begin to try to
 
03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on here and
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
03:22:50.309 --> 03:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
explanation which helps me along the way
 
03:22:50.319 --> 03:22:51.349 align:start position:0%
explanation which helps me along the way
uh

03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
is there a reason
 
03:22:55.750 --> 03:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
why you would retain
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
in line three 100 pounds rather than to
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
utilize the more commonly used metric
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
grams or kilograms
 
03:23:07.790 --> 03:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
given that it's 2022 and not
 
03:23:10.150 --> 03:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
1852 any longer
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
is there is there a rationale for
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
continuing that not changing that
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting point because in
 
03:23:21.510 --> 03:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
our in our law it does re um allow for
 
03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
metrics to be utilized when we were
 
03:23:27.670 --> 03:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
looking at defining the term precision
 
03:23:30.630 --> 03:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's why we did in that category
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
define it with both metric and ava
 
03:23:33.680 --> 03:23:34.870 align:start position:0%
define it with both metric and ava

we i
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
i just did not change the the
 
03:23:44.710 --> 03:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
would you consider that in in the future
 
03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
given that it's it's quite prevalent and
 
03:23:52.469 --> 03:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
common in this day and age to use metric
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
measurements which are more precise
 
03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:24:04.150 --> 03:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm just so i understand this bill
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
because this is all new to me
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
would this when you when you're talking
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
precision scales are you talking you
 
03:24:15.429 --> 03:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
know i've worked in you know the
 
03:24:15.439 --> 03:24:16.790 align:start position:0%
know i've worked in you know the
industry

03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:17.750 align:start position:0%
industry
where

03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
03:24:18.960 --> 03:24:19.830 align:start position:0%
some of the
um

03:24:19.830 --> 03:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:21.750 --> 03:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and
 
03:24:24.790 --> 03:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
small supermarkets will use a scale to
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
measure their meats to sell
 
03:24:29.429 --> 03:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
are you talking these type of precision
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
scales also no that would be in the
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
hundred pounds or less category
 
03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:36.870 align:start position:0%
hundred pounds or less category
okay

03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay you guys you're all sad all right
 
03:24:49.269 --> 03:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
this is just to satisfy my curiosity
 
03:24:53.590 --> 03:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions uh
 
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
could you tell us about how these
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
scales and different
 
03:25:00.389 --> 03:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
instruments are
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
calibrated and maintained over time okay
 
03:25:06.469 --> 03:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're required to have any commercial
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
device that is used
 
03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:12.870 align:start position:0%
device that is used
commercially

03:25:12.870 --> 03:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
commercially
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
certified state certified
 
03:25:17.590 --> 03:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
every single year
 
03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:18.630 align:start position:0%
every single year
now

03:25:18.630 --> 03:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:25:20.630 --> 03:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
we do this in order to protect the
 
03:25:22.870 --> 03:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
consumer and their interests we want to
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that those devices are
 
03:25:27.670 --> 03:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
operating in a proper manner
 
03:25:28.180 --> 03:25:28.190 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:25:28.190 --> 03:25:31.590 align:start position:0%
and so
[Music]

03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
by licensing them in the correct
 
03:25:36.070 --> 03:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
category we know what type of equipment
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
to utilize to go out and test these
 
03:25:38.239 --> 03:25:39.429 align:start position:0%
to utilize to go out and test these
devices

03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
devices
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
now in
 
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
if any of you are aware of the national
 
03:25:45.990 --> 03:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
institute of standards and technology
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
down in gaithersburg maryland
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that put together our
 
03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
handbooks for the national conference on
 
03:25:54.790 --> 03:25:54.800 align:start position:0%

which is an online version now
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
they actually specify what the
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
examination procedure outlines are
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
when a device is certified
 
03:26:12.710 --> 03:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so we require
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
service companies that are also licensed
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
with our office to follow the

examination procedure
 
03:26:20.550 --> 03:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
discern whether those devices are within
 
03:26:26.469 --> 03:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
tolerance and whether they can be state
 
03:26:26.479 --> 03:26:29.510 align:start position:0%

03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
did i answer
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
your question
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
yeah and then to take that back a step
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
further the
 
03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
companies that you the vendors that you
 
03:26:43.750 --> 03:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
contract with how do they make sure that
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
their instruments are calibrated good
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
question so
 
03:26:47.840 --> 03:26:49.349 align:start position:0%
question so
um

03:26:49.349 --> 03:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:51.510 --> 03:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
we also require any of those service
 
03:26:53.190 --> 03:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
technicians that are licensed with a
 
03:26:55.349 --> 03:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
division of weights and measures to have
 
03:26:57.670 --> 03:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
their equipment calibrated
 
03:26:59.830 --> 03:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis so every year they
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
have to have their equipment calibrated
 
03:27:03.269 --> 03:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
they report that information to us so
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
that we can track it to make sure that
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
the equipment they are using
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
is appropriate for the devices that
 
03:27:13.269 --> 03:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
they're certifying
 
03:27:15.190 --> 03:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
so is that a third party or do they have
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
that that system in-house it is
 
03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
we are working to get some of the
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
ability to be in-house we have a state
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
metrology lab that is currently working
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
very diligently to get accreditation
 
03:27:34.309 --> 03:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
so that we can do some of the the
 
03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
calibrating of that equipment ourselves
 
03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:38.590 align:start position:0%
calibrating of that equipment ourselves
okay

03:27:38.590 --> 03:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony would you
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
believe once upon a time ago in another
 
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
lifetime i used to run a pmel lab
 
03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:50.070 align:start position:0%
lifetime i used to run a pmel lab
precision

03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
precision
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
measurement and we had to have our
 
03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:56.070 align:start position:0%
measurement and we had to have our
standards

03:27:56.070 --> 03:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
checked by the state and national
 
03:27:58.560 --> 03:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
checked by the state and national
standards

03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:28:02.389 --> 03:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
and when we went out
 
03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
we had our certifications with us in the
 
03:28:06.630 --> 03:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
book so that we could show the people
 
03:28:08.710 --> 03:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
who had contracted us
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
that their weights or whatever are going
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
03:28:16.469 --> 03:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
also would you believe once upon a time
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
in another lifetime
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
i worked in a precision
 
03:28:22.630 --> 03:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh chemical laboratory
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
where the balance
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
the precision balance which was in the
 
03:28:26.239 --> 03:28:27.349 align:start position:0%
the precision balance which was in the
glass

03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
glass
 
03:28:30.550 --> 03:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh and we had to pick up the weights
 
03:28:33.269 --> 03:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
with a pair of tweezers
 
03:28:35.590 --> 03:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
we could not contaminate them with our
 
03:28:35.600 --> 03:28:36.870 align:start position:0%
we could not contaminate them with our
fingers

03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
fingers
 
03:28:39.510 --> 03:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i know both ends the gross and the
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
minute and
 
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony it was it's
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
nice seeing somebody from like my old
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
days thank you wonderful thank you
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay we're all set
 
03:28:58.870 --> 03:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
03:29:05.269 --> 03:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:07.590 --> 03:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
just so you all know this was um we were
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be exec
 
03:29:09.120 --> 03:29:10.469 align:start position:0%
supposed to be exec
today

03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
this was remember the exec we did yes
 
03:29:13.990 --> 03:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
last week
 
03:29:15.990 --> 03:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
that this i had originally scheduled
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
this was we were going to get all our
 
03:29:19.269 --> 03:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
bills out which
 
03:29:20.710 --> 03:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
which are already done and they're
 
03:29:22.630 --> 03:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
already on the way so
 
03:29:22.640 --> 03:29:23.510 align:start position:0%
already on the way so
yeah

03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
they did right so
 
03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:26.469 align:start position:0%
they did right so
okay

03:29:26.469 --> 03:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:29:26.479 --> 03:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:30.070 --> 03:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
and so we have uh
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
daniel richardson uh is in uh support of
 
03:29:35.349 --> 03:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
and of course cheryl sort of bill
 
03:29:39.990 --> 03:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
and with that we will close the public
 
03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:44.389 align:start position:0%
and with that we will close the public
hearing

03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:46.150 --> 03:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
so uh just so you know we we
 
03:29:49.990 --> 03:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
we don't execute anything in the same
 
03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
day we're we're not the senate you know
 
03:29:55.269 --> 03:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
right but uh we we uh we will schedule a
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee wheel because this is
 
03:29:58.469 --> 03:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
technically under our business category
 
03:30:00.550 --> 03:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
so you will see in the calendar that we
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee on it and then we'll
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
execute the bill but
 
03:30:06.070 --> 03:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
and and but we we we just go through the
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee process just so we can make
 
03:30:09.269 --> 03:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
sure we know who's going to carry
 
03:30:10.469 --> 03:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
forward with the bill and write the
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
blurb but you gave us all kinds of good
 
03:30:15.910 --> 03:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
things to write now on for ourselves so
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:30:18.479 --> 03:30:21.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
okay

03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
let's see if i checked my name on the
 
03:30:33.680 --> 03:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
let's see if i checked my name on the
list

03:30:34.950 --> 03:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
list
 
03:30:37.510 --> 03:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
where we have no privacy evidently any
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
no i haven't really thought about that i
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
mean to me executing is when we we got
 
03:30:54.150 --> 03:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know done the subcommittees and we
 
03:30:55.510 --> 03:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
got all our ducks in a row and know
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
where we're going with it
 
03:31:00.309 --> 03:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
so next week we're doing nothing so the
 
03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
following week we'll we'll schedule you
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
know um subcommittees
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
and then i might
 
03:31:06.960 --> 03:31:07.830 align:start position:0%
and then i might
yeah

03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:31:10.550 --> 03:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
i don't have to see how it fits how it
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
all fits in i get i got to take my
 
03:31:14.790 --> 03:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
calendar out and figure that out
 
03:31:16.389 --> 03:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
i have not done that i mean other than
 
03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that yes you know come march
 
03:31:22.630 --> 03:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to the caribbean
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be uh
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
was it march 9th to the
 
03:31:29.040 --> 03:31:29.910 align:start position:0%
was it march 9th to the
to

03:31:29.910 --> 03:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know ten it's nine days ten
 
03:31:32.080 --> 03:31:33.030 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know ten it's nine days ten
days

03:31:33.030 --> 03:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
so i i might miss a session day so i
 
03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't know how that's gonna work out but
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:43.920 --> 03:31:46.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:31:46.469 --> 03:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
so that would be yeah so no yeah my
 
03:31:49.910 --> 03:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
flight is at the end of the week so
 
03:31:53.429 --> 03:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll meet that week
 
03:31:55.590 --> 03:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of days there march 7. when
 
03:31:58.389 --> 03:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
they may pull my calendar
 
03:31:58.399 --> 03:32:00.550 align:start position:0%
they may pull my calendar
so

03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:03.990 --> 03:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
right the night is uh
 
03:32:06.870 --> 03:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
tonight is a wednesday huh
 
03:32:11.590 --> 03:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought it was the 11th i
 
03:32:19.349 --> 03:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
session days are going to be in there
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
because you know theoretically we have
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
to have everything done by the end of
 
03:32:28.950 --> 03:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:31.110 --> 03:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
so feel feel free to
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know not be here that way we can
 
03:32:34.150 --> 03:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
match up you know we can
 
03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
cross each other's boats
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
what they call pairing pairing
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:53.190 --> 03:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:55.910 --> 03:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
tuesday the first
 
03:33:02.830 --> 03:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's a tuesday so no we have to be the
 
03:33:11.600 --> 03:33:13.110 align:start position:0%
that's a tuesday so no we have to be the
second

03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:33:16.830 --> 03:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's hoping that they've got it done by
 
03:33:24.630 --> 03:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
that you know in terms of getting you
 
03:33:24.640 --> 03:33:27.670 align:start position:0%
that you know in terms of getting you
know

03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so again it would be you know
 
03:33:34.870 --> 03:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:36.950 --> 03:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
we could possibly be exactly on the
 
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:48.309 --> 03:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:48.319 --> 03:33:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
so i can say that the one of our liquor
 
03:33:52.880 --> 03:33:53.990 align:start position:0%
so i can say that the one of our liquor
bills

03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
the one that about the multiple computer
 
03:33:56.399 --> 03:33:59.110 align:start position:0%
the one that about the multiple computer
systems

03:33:59.110 --> 03:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.990 --> 03:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
the multiple point of sale systems
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
um so with that one um the liquor
 
03:34:06.790 --> 03:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
commission is working on a bulletin
 
03:34:07.830 --> 03:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
to let all
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh licensees to know that yes they can
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
have just one computer so that's being
 
03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
done the um the food cart thing
 
03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:21.990 align:start position:0%
done the um the food cart thing
um

03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:23.190 --> 03:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
well there was the two of them it's the
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
food truck and then the the food cart
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
the food cart uh
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
food cart issue
 
03:34:32.790 --> 03:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
what i would um i
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
suggested to the department is for we'll
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
have a uh
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
a you know
 
03:34:41.910 --> 03:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
nanoplus so we'll have a food cart plus
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
and a food cart plus
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
will basically
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
take the concept of the what do you call
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
it a
 
03:34:48.239 --> 03:34:49.910 align:start position:0%
it a
commissary

03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
commissary
 
03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
and but that the key element i told him
 
03:34:54.550 --> 03:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
is i want the commissary making sure
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
that the commissary could be somebody's
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
own kitchen or someone in their home
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
so that they could
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
take this you know zooped up
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
unit this you know the actual unit that
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
they're using for selling
 
03:35:10.389 --> 03:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
that is going to be theoretically going
 
03:35:12.309 --> 03:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
to have whatever you know proper heating
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
systems proper whatever
 
03:35:15.510 --> 03:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
they could actually
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
take it to where they're going
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
on a trailer like a you know a lawnmower
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
trailer they could put it on the trailer
 
03:35:23.190 --> 03:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
and then they could take it home
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
and clean it out
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
and i said and then have then have the
 
03:35:28.950 --> 03:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know kind of the chili so you can
 
03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
get a chili dog you can get whatever
 
03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
that would be the full-fledged thing and
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
i said i understand you guys want to
 
03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
make requirements about that you can't
 
03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
reuse the chili then once you put the
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
chili in
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
the box you can't use it the next day
 
03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know you had you got to make sure
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
that everything is is new and fresh i
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
said you you know basically i told them
 
03:35:48.560 --> 03:35:49.750 align:start position:0%
said you you know basically i told them
um

03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
and they they they feel very confident
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
and that if anything we'll just have a
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
statute then whether we need a statute
 
03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
even to say that they'll have this
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
second level
 
03:36:02.640 --> 03:36:03.590 align:start position:0%
second level
yep

03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
i thought the third bill that was
 
03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:06.630 align:start position:0%
i thought the third bill that was
presented

03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
presented
 
03:36:07.830 --> 03:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
that day
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
by representative aaron
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
would be the one that
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
we could vote on because it's a study
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee to study all the rules and
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
regulations on you know food carts and
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
food trucks and i thought that would
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
that would be the best way to go but you
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
know if you spoke if you
 
03:36:26.080 --> 03:36:28.550 align:start position:0%
know if you spoke if you
because

03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
you were just talking about you know
 
03:36:31.510 --> 03:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
making chili at home i mean you can't
 
03:36:33.269 --> 03:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
make chili at home if you're in
 
03:36:33.279 --> 03:36:34.469 align:start position:0%
make chili at home if you're in
manchester

03:36:34.469 --> 03:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
and sell it on a food cart
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
you can't do that because that
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
manchester has a health
 
03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:41.030 align:start position:0%
manchester has a health
inspector

03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
inspector
 
03:36:43.510 --> 03:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
and they don't allow homesteading or
 
03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:44.790 align:start position:0%
and they don't allow homesteading or
manufacturing

03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
03:36:47.349 --> 03:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh in cities in homes
 
03:36:49.030 --> 03:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's part of me that hope that i
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
hear you and that oh well
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
so um but you know the part of me is
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
is that i would hope that
 
03:36:59.190 --> 03:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
if we were to get get this accomplished
 
03:37:01.110 --> 03:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
that some of these cities would then
 
03:37:04.229 --> 03:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
rethink their policies and reflect the
 
03:37:05.349 --> 03:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
state one
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
but that would be a state problem i
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
can't we can't and that really goes back
 
03:37:10.389 --> 03:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
to this truck problem
 
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
i just don't think we can fix the truck
 
03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:13.269 align:start position:0%
i just don't think we can fix the truck
problem

03:37:13.269 --> 03:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
um because at the end of the day that
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
you the the towns want to license and
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
regulate the truck themselves those
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
cities excuse me cities that want to do
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
it we can't stop them from doing that
 
03:37:27.030 --> 03:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
and the idea that we should have a state
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
license that supersedes that license i
 
03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:30.389 align:start position:0%
license that supersedes that license i
just

03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm not ready to go there i don't know
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
how many people think that's a good idea
 
03:37:34.640 --> 03:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
how many people think that's a good idea
but

03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
i just don't think we can do that
 
03:37:40.150 --> 03:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
so but that if it is true that some
 
03:37:43.349 --> 03:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
cities refuse to let people
 
03:37:45.670 --> 03:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
have their home commissaries if they
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's their city's choice then that's
 
03:37:49.190 --> 03:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
their city's choice and
 
03:37:51.750 --> 03:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
and all you can do is urge and once we
 
03:37:54.630 --> 03:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
have estate plan in place to urge them
 
03:37:56.710 --> 03:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
to reconsider their
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
draconian position well and i imagine
 
03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
anybody that owns a food truck or a cart
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
goes through the safe serve program
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
i mean that's necessary i would assume
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
that didn't you say that that the
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
manchester was requiring you to have the
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
state permit anyways
 
03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
right so so so it seems to me that yes
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
manchester's over-regulated if the
 
03:38:24.630 --> 03:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
require you had a state permit and then
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
get a local permit
 
03:38:29.110 --> 03:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
boy that seems a little
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's because they have a health
 
03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:31.429 align:start position:0%
it's because they have a health
department

03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
and that's in there
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know i'm just because they have a
 
03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
health department right
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
there wasn't anybody from cities here i
 
03:38:38.550 --> 03:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
know the
 
03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
municipal um uh what's the not what's
 
03:38:44.070 --> 03:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
the missible association yeah they were
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
here and then they left before
 
03:38:47.429 --> 03:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
testifying because they were against the
 
03:38:47.439 --> 03:38:48.630 align:start position:0%
testifying because they were against the
bills

03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
but like i say i i'm not sure we can fix
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
that problem because you you're at the
 
03:38:56.309 --> 03:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
end of the day those cities you know any
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
city's going to want to reserve the
 
03:38:57.600 --> 03:38:58.389 align:start position:0%
city's going to want to reserve the
right

03:38:58.389 --> 03:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:39:01.349 --> 03:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
to regulate and and zone frankly
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
where they yeah zoning's a whole other
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
issue right i mean and and frankly i
 
03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
think the biggest barrier to that market
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
is what keith said
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's where you're going to you've got to
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
find a land you've got to find someone
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
who's going to take it and let you park
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
there yep
 
03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a zoning issue it's a you know
 
03:39:19.189 --> 03:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's more well i mean zoning it's it's a
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
look you know getting that initial
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
contract and you can drive your truck
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
all around but
 
03:39:25.670 --> 03:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know unless you sit at a you know i
 
03:39:27.269 --> 03:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
know i don't know do we lot our state
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
parks do we allow them to be in the
 
03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.309 --> 03:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
don't you think it would make sense
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it does that does make sense yeah
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
salmon yeah well if the truck had water
 
03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
but you would mention that they were
 
03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
going to try to do it in rules for this
 
03:39:49.030 --> 03:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
hot dog new yeah
 
03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
is it going to be in a another is it
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
going to be a
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
more expensive fee the fee would have to
 
03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
reflect that there would be more
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
licensure regulation that they would
 
03:40:01.269 --> 03:40:01.279 align:start position:0%
have to come and check out the kitchen
 
03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
so it won't be a big fee difference but
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
because they got it they got to
 
03:40:10.389 --> 03:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
rationalize sending someone out to look
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
at it so
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
no i just i just actually the idea that
 
03:40:16.389 --> 03:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh that we were talking about was
 
03:40:18.469 --> 03:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be great that someone could
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
bring their
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
truck bring it to them
 
03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
and and so that was something that they
 
03:40:28.469 --> 03:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
they seemed that it's not a bad idea
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
they're you know to obviously to
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
facilitate that for customers yeah that
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
was my idea why couldn't they just do
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
like you know
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
a couple times a year or whatever where
 
03:40:40.229 --> 03:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
they say all the food trucks need to
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
come in and get inspected right here's
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
your time slot everybody goes in it's
 
03:40:47.910 --> 03:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
less it's it's more cost efficient to
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
have the truck i mean the trucks are
 
03:40:49.520 --> 03:40:52.070 align:start position:0%
have the truck i mean the trucks are
trucks

03:40:52.070 --> 03:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know bring it to them they just do a
 
03:40:54.080 --> 03:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
you know bring it to them they just do a
massive

03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
massive
 
03:40:57.269 --> 03:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
day of inspections
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
right they can have water hook up there
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
so they and plug in so that everything's
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
done right there now they know that
 
03:41:03.910 --> 03:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
certified and it's
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
in a controlled environment and saves
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
everybody time from running all over the
 
03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:07.990 align:start position:0%
everybody time from running all over the
state

03:41:07.990 --> 03:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:10.469 align:start position:0%
state
yeah

03:41:10.469 --> 03:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.479 --> 03:41:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
you
