yes

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
well the chair has to see it
 
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
something tells me everything somebody
 
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
it is nine o'clock we have a schedule
 
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the first
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
on our agenda is a
 
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
is the exotic aquatic weeds an animal
 
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
species committee presentation
 
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative smith would like to
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
introduce good morning committee members
 
00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
i am i serve as the chair of the aquatic
 
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
exotic weeds and species committee
 
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.550 align:start position:0%
exotic weeds and species committee
and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative creighton is also on this
 
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee we meet monthly and we
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
work with the agencies and other groups
 
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
to help mitigate
 
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.190 align:start position:0%
to help mitigate
prevent

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
the outgrowth of aquatic invasives
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
whether weeds or
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
mussels or other things and so this is a
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
presentation that the committee has put
 
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
together and i'm joined today by
 
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
michelle tremblay who represents the new
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire rivers council

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.350 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire lakes who all are on
the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm going to turn the
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
microphone over to michelle tremblay who
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
will take the lead and at the close of
 
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
the presentation
 
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
there will be time for questions and
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
that can be answered by any of us any of
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone sort of like march
 
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
of the valkyries isn't it it's like this
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
whole parade of women that are talking
 
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
to you about invasive species
 
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
i'm really happy to be here and thanks
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
for your time on this i'm going to be
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
joined by experts uh amy smagula and
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
michelle davis if she wants to come up
 
00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
and sit with us as well
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
and amy's going to provide color
 
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.589 align:start position:0%
and amy's going to provide color
commentary

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
commentary
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
just like it's a hockey hockey game
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
this is a serious threat to new
 
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire's waters and some are not
 
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
invaded yet and some are just ripe for
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
it depending on the access
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
and michelle's going to talk a little
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
bit about what's happening with trying
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
to prevent that
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about the scope of
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
this the threat
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
our actions and others to mitigate the
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
risks and are we doing enough in spoiler
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
alert the answer is no okay one second
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
is there members of the committee who
 
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
can't see the screen if you'd like to
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
go out uh move out to the
 
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
to the area out
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
there uh
 
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.510 align:start position:0%
there uh
just

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
just looked like i don't know how you
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
isn't there also that's uh
 
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.189 align:start position:0%
isn't there also that's uh
representative

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
spang's chair but yeah
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
and he's not there so
 
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
please please continue yes i am sorry
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
for the interest no no thank you um mr
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
chair i think it's really important that
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
all right it's a good view now of all
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
the horrible pictures we're going to
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
show you this morning
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
all right so the definition of invasive
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
species it's non-native earth alien to
 
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
and the introduction is likely to cause
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
harm not only to the environment but in
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
some cases to human health
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
and here's a map i know that it's
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to see you will be receiving a
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
pdf of this presentation so you'll be
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
able to see things easier
 
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
but there's a list on the left of the
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
invasions themselves as well as where
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
they're located and often they are
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
co-located so a water body may be
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
threatened by multiple invasive species
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
and amy what's the current number um i
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
think we
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
had a current number for all of the
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
water bodies but this is a breakdown of
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you amy
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
so you can see that invasive species
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
aren't just for lakes anymore rivers are
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
and the most threatening to ais to new
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire is variable milfoil and you
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
can see what a cove
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
in squam lake what can happen with a
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
complete takeover you can see that
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a channel that's
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
been cut by boats
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's also fan wart this is a picture
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
and then water chestnut i mentioned that
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
invasive species are now in rivers water
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
chestnut is
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
coming going across this river from bank
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
and then european or brittle niad this
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
is in six water bodies right now
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
and then moving on to animals this is
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
asian clam and this is in the merrimack
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
river in beau
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
and it's in a lot of lakes including um
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
cobble pond in i'm not getting that
 
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.869 align:start position:0%
cobble pond in i'm not getting that
right

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
so it's not only just about aesthetics
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
and boating and swimming it's also
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
economic sectors
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
recreation and tourism boating can be
 
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.749 align:start position:0%
recreation and tourism boating can be
affected

00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
and several years ago there was a report
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
called what's our water worth
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
and the perception of water quality when
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
there are plants that take over water
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
bodies as you see here they can reduce
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
property values so the redistribution of
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes or assessments
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
can change
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
and 25 percent of the water bodies you
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
can see in meredith make up over 50
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
percent of the town's total assessed
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
property value so when those values go
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
down as i said the tax or the assessment
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
is redis redistributed
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
across other properties and it affects
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
tourism which is 5 billion a year for
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
that's recreational fishing visitors to
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
state parks and then out of state or
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
transient boaters all of them
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
have a perception or a real
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
perception of what our water is worth
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
and the water quality
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
if we talk about
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
more than just aesthetics and more than
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
just the pleasure of enjoying our lakes
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
and rivers there are other sectors that
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
are impacted none of these are in new
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire thank heaven for now
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
but you can see where it's a dam intake
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
there's marine structures agricultural
 
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.949 align:start position:0%
there's marine structures agricultural
irrigation

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
irrigation
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
power plants treatment plants and even
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the upper right you can see they've
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
clogged a water pipe this can happen
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
with a lot of invasive species but
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
from a cost standpoint prevention is
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
always the least expensive way to deal
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
with invasive species unfortunately it
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the heart stirred up when
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
everything looks wonderful you don't
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
think that you need to put in an effort
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
and you don't think that you need to
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
spend the money but this is actually
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
where the least amount of money is spent
 
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.990 align:start position:0%
where the least amount of money is spent
once

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
when you move on to early detection that
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
means that you have people such as
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
michelle davis's program we'll talk
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
about that in a moment and river runners
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
which the new hampshire rivers council
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
runs that's the idea of making sure that
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
there's surveillance so that you can
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
catch invasive species before they take
 
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
catch invasive species before they take
over

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
from there it moves into rapid response
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
so you want to make sure that you are
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
jumping on the problem
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that you're not letting it
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
go and turning into a bank to bank or an
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
entire cove infestation
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
and sadly you can see that once you get
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
to treatment and control and long-term
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
management the dollars go up really what
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
you're doing is holding back the tide
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
which is challenging to say the least
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
prevention and early detection we
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned the lake hosts
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
weed watchers river runners and various
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
other outreach to check boats to talk to
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
people about how these things can be
 
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
people about how these things can be
spread

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
spread
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then there's the best available
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
technologies to prevent ais and michelle
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
do you want to tell us about this
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
uh so the the photo in the center is a
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's called a cd3 unit it's clean drain
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
dry and dispose
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot program that new
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire lakes has been running for
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
about three years now
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a mobile
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
solar powered waterless
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
watercraft like boat cleaning station
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
this is sort of the the cadillac of cd3
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
units there are
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
other smaller options and there are
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
options that are stationary so the goal
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the program is to
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
increase awareness of the threat of
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive species of course and
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
and increase boater awareness of the
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
importance of cleaning draining and
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
drying their boats
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
when they're entering or leaving
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
water bodies and so this particular unit
 
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.269 align:start position:0%
water bodies and so this particular unit
has

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
a wet vacuum on it
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
it has a
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
pressurized air to dry the your boat
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
and it also has some tools to clean and
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
um and grab
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
plant fragments off of the boat um and
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a
 
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.150 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a
uh

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
what is the wrench called with the
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
that opens the
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
yeah the drain wrench thank you um
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
that so you can you can um empty your
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
your live well so um new hampshire lakes
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
has been deploying this this unit around
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
the state um for two this year and last
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
year for two week increments at
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
different boat ramps um with the hope
 
00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:43.590 align:start position:0%
different boat ramps um with the hope
that

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh local local groups and um communities
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
will eventually purchase
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
units of their own that will be
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
stationary this is
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
a great tool it's not
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the best option for
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
sloped dirt ramps this may not be the
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
best option but it is a it is a great
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
tool um for the for the places that are
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate for it but other other
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
options for best available technologies
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
to prevent aquatic invasive species are
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know garden hoses um even just
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
simple tools to to reach under your boat
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
and grab plant fragments like i
 
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.069 align:start position:0%
and grab plant fragments like i
mentioned

00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
and there's also options um like if any
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
of you have visited lake george in new
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
york state
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
they have hot water
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
high pressure boat cleaning stations
 
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.750 align:start position:0%
high pressure boat cleaning stations
which

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
are a lot more expensive and again not
 
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
are a lot more expensive and again not
necessarily

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for all boat launches here
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you michelle and
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
this unit is really interesting and i
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
wondered if you wanted to talk a little
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
where people can clean their own boats
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
so that they're not essentially washing
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
invasive species
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
into the water body and do you want to
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
talk about lake post now sure i can do
 
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.509 align:start position:0%
talk about lake post now sure i can do
that

00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:58.949 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's really important as you're
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
leaving the lake to
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
not be washing your boat in a space
 
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.710 align:start position:0%
not be washing your boat in a space
where

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
the the water is going to run back into
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
the lake and then potentially
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
result in a new infestation
 
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.670 align:start position:0%
result in a new infestation
um

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
often times they'll be um
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
at sort of are the best possible ramps
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
there'll be
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
locations that you can pull off to the
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
side where you can clean your boat and
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
there'll be disposal
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
stations for any sort of plant fragments
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
that you do pull off your boat um and
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
then as far as the lake host program
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
goes new hampshire lakes has been
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
running the lake coast program are
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
facilitating the lake host program for
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
about 20 years now
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
and the lake host program
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
partners with local groups to
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
staff boat ramps
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
so that people can help
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
boaters check their boats for aquatic
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
invasive species and the courtesy boat
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
inspection program this year we are
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
anticipating about 80 groups
 
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.790 align:start position:0%
anticipating about 80 groups
participating

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
participating
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
and that is a total of about 700 paid
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
and volunteer at lake hosts
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
last in 2021 we had 15 saves and those
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
are specimens prevented from entering a
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
water body
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
and several of those saves were at on in
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
currently uninfested water bodies
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
and then the weed watcher program and
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
the river runner program that michelle
 
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.990 align:start position:0%
the river runner program that michelle
mentioned

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
is a volunteer program where
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
people will
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
periodically throughout the summer
 
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.949 align:start position:0%
periodically throughout the summer
paddle

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
paddle
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
or around their lakes and and look in
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
the shallow waters and try to
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
try to catch an infestation sort of
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
early on for that that early detection
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
people volunteer to do that on both
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
rivers and lakes
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i think it's you know once a month
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
that they that they paddle around so
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
it's a group effort but i would note
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
also that
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
volunteerism generally in new hampshire
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
is going down and so every year we are
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
noticing it being harder and harder for
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
local groups to hire both paid and
 
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.710 align:start position:0%
local groups to hire both paid and
volunteer

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
lake coast and and the weed watcher
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you michelle that's a really
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
important point to bring up when we
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
talked about the costs is that new
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire runs on volunteers that
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
includes all of you i know you have high
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
salaries but
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
we all consider you to be volunteers as
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
well and for river runners one of the
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
things that's interesting is that they
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't often make saves as you describe
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
to us negative findings or data but for
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers they can often lose interest
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
so that continuum that we showed you
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
where it's less costly when there's
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
nothing going on and you're conducting
 
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:53.430 align:start position:0%
nothing going on and you're conducting
surveillance

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
that makes it difficult to keep people
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
engaged because we all like to rally
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
around a crisis but when it comes to
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
so now we are at that point of rapid
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
response treatment and control and
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
earlier amy and i were discussing divers
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
it used to be that there were more
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
people that did this as volunteers but
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
now it's contractors so you can see hand
 
00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:19.990 align:start position:0%
now it's contractors so you can see hand
pulling

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
pulling
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
the diver assistant suction harvest so
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
you can all sound like insiders now and
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
just say dash because it sounds cool
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
benthic barriers which i believe aren't
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
used as much as they used to be and then
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
herbicide application which is often
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
controversial with late groups and
 
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.390 align:start position:0%
controversial with late groups and
communities

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
and then the most expensive is long-term
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
management these five-year long plans
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
have developed been developed for 65
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
water bodies is that current amy
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
and they integrate a number of
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
management techniques which are
 
00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
management techniques which are
pulling

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
pulling
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
herbicides and they utilize public park
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
public private partnerships
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
the state agencies that are responsible
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
one full-time employee
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
it is her
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
super amy
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
seasonal interns is available and it is
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
funded from boat registration fees the
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
general fund and then the decals
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture markets
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
and food is the
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
division of pesticide control they
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
provide the permits for herbicide
 
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
provide the permits for herbicide
application

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
and they have a one partial full-time
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
equivalent so that means part of a
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
person we hope that we get the head and
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
at least an arm to sign permits on that
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
part of a person
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire fish and game they are
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for invasive animals whereas
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
des is responsible for plants
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
they have no staff or funding dedicated
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
to this right now we have been working
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
on it and they don't have any monitoring
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
or rapid response plans in place
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
our committee was established by you in
 
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.870 align:start position:0%
our committee was established by you in
2004

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
2004
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
the members include legislators state
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
agencies non-profit public members and
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're essentially a long-term study
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee i know that that raises
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
questions with a lot of people as far as
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
having long-term committees but it
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
really has provided a long-term and
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
focused basis
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
on what we can do with invasive species
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
so not only deciding to introduce a bill
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
but being able to sort of be in place
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
to study an issue and make
 
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.150 align:start position:0%
to study an issue and make
recommendations

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
the funding as you can see again we'll
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
send this to you as a pdf but the
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
funding for ais activities has gone up
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the boat registrations
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
and amy has this leveled off i heard
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
that this had leveled off as far as how
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
many boats are going to be registered
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
right so we'll we'll maybe update this
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
before we send out the pdf then
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
amy so you can see the funding uh the
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
general funds the decals the private
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
donations and municipal funds
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
and then we won't
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
torture your eyes with this but the
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures have obviously gone up with
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
the demand
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
the control grants amy can you tell us a
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
are you sure yeah okay
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
all right so you can see that the grant
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
program has gone up these grants are not
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
only for research but they're also for
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
programs such as the new hampshire lakes
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
for lake host
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
and others that need to apply herbicides
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
to control invasive species
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
but here's the interesting thing
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
municipal funding makes up the most of
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
what is dedicated to invasive species
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
this is match
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
these are funds that communities raise
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
because they feel like their water
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
bodies are important to them locally
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
private funding this would be
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
foundations this would be individual
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
donations and then you can see the state
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
is actually a small part of that
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
this works well right now but there is a
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
need for more
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
and having the state be the smallest
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
part of this when these are part of the
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
public trust these are public waters
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
seems like we would want to dedicate
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
so the threat is serious and it will
 
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.110 align:start position:0%
so the threat is serious and it will
increase

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
they continue to grow just one
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
fragment of a weed can take root so to
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
speak in the water or in the
 
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.350 align:start position:0%
speak in the water or in the
sediment

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
sediment
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
and when you have for instance shallow
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
waters where a lot of sun reaches it the
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
sediments are there they're full of
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
nutrients this is a ripe area to grow
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
anything and then fragments can float
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
around and that they can grow
 
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:38.710 align:start position:0%
around and that they can grow
so

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
the lake host program is one of the most
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
impressive in the region it's being
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
treated as a model right now for many
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
other states that want to do it but as
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
michelle pointed out even with the paid
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
people they can't reach everywhere all
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
so we do need your support you are the
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
committee that makes the decision about
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
these and your leadership is very
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
important to talk about funding the
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
partnerships how we can increase our
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
work the outreach that's very important
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
to educate people
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
and as an example of what we can do
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
together that horror picture that we
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
showed right in the beginning
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
that on the right is before pardon me
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
after milfoil management so it's not
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
going to go away completely this is the
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
kind of place where invasive species not
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
just milfoil will grow
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
so it's a success story but we have to
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
remain vigilant on it
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
this is the membership of the study
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee so you can see that lakes
 
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.350 align:start position:0%
committee so you can see that lakes
rivers

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
rivers
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
particular water bodies some of your
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
alumni such as john mullen
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative creighton is here
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
senators heads of state agencies and
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
then staff such as amy smagula are
 
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.070 align:start position:0%
then staff such as amy smagula are
represented

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
that's all that we have today to show
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
you for the good and the bad pictures
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
and we welcome your questions
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
i have uh one first uh
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
first one in
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
and then i'll recognize representative
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
well i'm losing air so
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
but anyway let me get my question in uh
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any federal funding at all
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
the federal funding is coming
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
and it is variable if i can explain that
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
for a moment state management plans have
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
to be approved by the u.s fish and
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
wildlife services aquatic nuisance
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
species task force
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is part of my day job so to speak
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
the rivers council is volunteer but
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
these state management plans are drafted
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
with agency cooperation they receive
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
funding each year there's a big pot of
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
money and depending on which state
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
management plans are approved and if
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
they apply for funding they get a piece
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the pizza so to speak so everyone
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
gets a slice of it that slice varies
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
every year depending on those factors so
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
the money is coming the plan has been
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
reviewed and amy are you anticipating
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
november or the spring
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
yep so the spring of 2023 is when the
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
task force will likely approve the plan
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
and then applications can be made at
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
but amy i'm not aware of any other
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
federal funding coming
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative post and representative
 
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.029 align:start position:0%
representative post and representative
gould

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
gould
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
presenting this today it was very
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
interesting um as far as the lake hosts
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
some people um doing the um
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
looking for the weeds and things like
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
that and you said you don't get many
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
volunteers has there been an outreach to
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
communities and
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
if so
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
do you have classes or anything to
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
that people can go to to participate in
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
this and and
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
has there been a reach out in
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
communities with a lot of lakes or even
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
ponds or rivers that
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
people can check on their own or get a
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
group together to do it so the way the
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
program works is that
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lakes facilitates the
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
program in the sense that
 
00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:27.029 align:start position:0%
program in the sense that
we

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
manage lake host payroll
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
train lake hosts
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
we've switched to this training as you
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
can imagine with the pandemic to a lot
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
of online training
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
but lake hosts are trained to identify
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
potential threatened or potential
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
threatening species and remove them from
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
the boats
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
we partner with lake associations so the
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
lake association would approach us
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
they apply for the program annually so
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
so programs have been running for 20
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
years um and so we're sort of the the
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
top of the umbrella and the and the lake
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
and each individual lake association
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
is responsible for hiring
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
and organizing and scheduling their lake
 
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.149 align:start position:0%
and organizing and scheduling their lake
hosts

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
hosts
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's where you get that mix of
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer and and paid so some and and
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
it requires a matching grant so we will
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
that that control grant that that was
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier new hampshire lakes
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
gets that and then distributes it out
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
among lake associations and then they
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
are also required to provide matching
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
funds um
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
for the for their program um so
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
and then we are also you know spreading
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
the word about the lake post program
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
i believe my colleague is is presenting
 
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.510 align:start position:0%
i believe my colleague is is presenting
at

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.710 align:start position:0%
at
um

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to remember the name of
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
the organization
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
but it's an organization um focus on
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
volunteerism and so she's she's
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
presenting at that meeting i believe
 
00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:01.190 align:start position:0%
presenting at that meeting i believe
tonight

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
about the lake coast program just to
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
just to continue to spread the word and
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
share the opportunity to to lake host
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
for other people is that the state's
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire organization
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.830 align:start position:0%
it may be
yeah

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up um so so my second
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
question is for folks that don't live in
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
a lake community but would like to
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
participate in this how would they go
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
about doing that i think that they would
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
just they would contact their local lake
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
association and i'm sure they could
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
contact new hampshire lakes who could
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
put them in touch with
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
the the lake host coordinator in a
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
nearby community but i think that you
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
know if they if they've got a lake that
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
they have a personal attachment to
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
contacting the lake coast or the lake
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
association on that lake would be
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
the best bet but reaching out to new
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire lakes is also an option
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
do you um look at ponds and things like
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
that i i know we have in our just in our
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
neighborhood because we're in a hilly
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
community it starts up here goes into a
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
river another pond is all the way down
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
is there any control or or
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
a way to look at those or are you
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
looking at those
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
places as well
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
because they're what eventually will go
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
into our rivers
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
are we looking at them for lake host
 
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.430 align:start position:0%
are we looking at them for lake host
programs

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.549 align:start position:0%
programs
right

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
to check on on those waterways and
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
things like that a lot of people go
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
kayaking in those ponds um
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
they they they could be what we consider
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
swamps but they're large bodies of water
 
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.230 align:start position:0%
swamps but they're large bodies of water
um

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i think so
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
for the lake host program specifically
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
the initiating the the development of a
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
lake host program on a body of water
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
is the the responsibility of initiating
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
that that falls on the local community
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
so that local lake association
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so if there is interest
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
the the local community would have to
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
initiate that program so come to new
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire lakes and and receive that
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
oh and i was just gonna say really
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
quickly um lake host focuses on boat
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
ramps so boats coming in and out of
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
those access points for weed watchers
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
groups can ask to be trained with it and
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
with river runners we do something
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
similar where we look for hosts
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
such as a chamber of commerce it can be
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
a local
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
lake association or river association
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
i've given trainings at all of them
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
and that is focused on people that are
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
already on the water so we teach them to
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
do what we call transects so they can go
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
along the shore either in a boat or they
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
can walk along the shore they're bird
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
watching they're fishing so we're
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
looking for people that are already on a
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
river or a lake in some cases lakes have
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
asked us to come
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
so we're not looking at the access
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
points with the equipment to do the
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
saves we're looking to see if people who
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
are already there are noticing something
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
different and training their eyes toward
 
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.149 align:start position:0%
different and training their eyes toward
that

00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for taking my question
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
actually you brought up something to me
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
because a kayaker for example or a
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
canoer can go into the water just
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
between a couple bushes so being on the
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
water to catch them is good but the
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
question i had i was curious how much is
 
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
that cadillac trailer how much does it
 
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.750 align:start position:0%
that cadillac trailer how much does it
cost

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh the cd3 unit that we purchased was
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
around forty thousand dollars forty five
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
thousand forty thousand okay but there
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
are so and and
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
part of what made that trailer
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
specifically more expensive is because
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
it is a mobile unit
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
there are units that are designed to be
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
installed permanently um and there are
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
there are units that are designed
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
without the solar panels on top that if
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's um elec electricity available
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
can be used and so there are smaller
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
units that don't have the vacuum or the
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
forced air they just have
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
some tools attached to it
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
there's a whole there's a whole i think
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
there's four different units that that
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
can be purchased at varying price points
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
can you get a cadillac for forty
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it and your objective is to show
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
people what can be done and hopefully
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
they'll buy their own and have it be
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
stationary or they can share a mobile
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think on my river
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
which everyone assumes is flows straight
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
from god's own
 
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.789 align:start position:0%
from god's own
source

00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
source
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
no one would really think to look for
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
invasive species
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
if something were
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
how would like the
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
rivers associations find out about it so
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
that they could leap into action
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
i think that probably unless they were
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
part of a program like river runners or
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
it was found at lake host then they
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
would probably contact environmental
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
services directly
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
that is my guess and with river runners
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
we have neat little zip blocks that
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
amy's program provides we ask people to
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
put them with a wet paper towel in there
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
and then we identify them if we get
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
stuck we ask amy to identify them so
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's a tricky question representative
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
spang because
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
i think it would rely on the finder so
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
to speak knowing where to send it so if
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
your association is interested in a
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
training i'd be happy to talk with you
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
about that and get people's eyes trained
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
toward it and also know what to do if
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
they find something
 
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.669 align:start position:0%
they find something
suspicious

00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
so it is up to the
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
watershed association to take the
 
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
watershed association to take the
initiative

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
to find out if there's a problem
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
um rather than to wait and find out to
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
hear from someone else like the river
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
runners that a problem has been found
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think if they're if they're
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
trained to understand and see something
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
different because they're out there all
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
the time i think you your lakers your
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
pardon me your river watershed
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
association is ideally poised
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and you might um
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
have people after training or even now
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
that are able to look at something right
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
away and say oh that's fine or
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's a problem heaven forbid or
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
we need help to identify it further some
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
of the samples can be quite degraded
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
particularly at the end of the season
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
and so those get pretty tricky and often
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
amy i think we found a sample once that
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
you sent off for dna testing because it
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
was so tricky
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the last resort
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
because it costs money but it's
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question what is your
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation for lake and river
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
residents who find something if they see
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
milfoil there or they see phragmites
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
there do you recommend that they pull
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
them up do you recommend that they try
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
to treat them on their own or order
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
chemicals online what are your
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions there um i absolutely don't
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
don't pull it don't try to treat it
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
yourself um the the nature of these
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
weeds um are that
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
they are you know invasive and and
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
prolific and so um the brittle nyad was
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
an example um it's
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's prone to breaking
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
and when the weeds
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
break that they'll float into other
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
places and establish in other places um
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
the same with with milfoil and that's
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
why it's particularly concerning when
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
boat propellers go through areas that
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
are infested because they're chopping up
 
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.950 align:start position:0%
are infested because they're chopping up
these

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
these plants and then
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's plants that are a floating and
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
then b potentially caught in the
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
propellers and being being transported
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
to other areas of the lake that aren't
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
currently infested or other other water
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
bodies entirely
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned phragmites it's the
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
bane of my existence i've been working
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
on a river restoration and the
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
phragmites spread so quickly and so
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
prolifically it's important also to know
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
purple loose strife is another example
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
when you're working with someone who
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
knows what they're doing timing is
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
everything because you don't want to be
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
pulling or cutting or moving anything
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
when you could be spreading seeds
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
and also rhizomes so where you dispose
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
of them is key as well but it's a really
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
really good question so don't touch it
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
until you contact someone who
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i was uh trained as part of my lake
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
association many years ago by amy who
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
came out and did a training for weed
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
watchers and if i am out kayaking
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the state i'm always keeping
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
my eyes open and at one point i even
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
took a picture of a weed and emailed it
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
to amy and said i found this and where i
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
found it and then she was able to tell
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
me you're okay or no send me the sample
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
in a plastic bag
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
anytime you're out kayaking if you know
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
any of your weeds you can do a little
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
bit of your own
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
sleuthing amy responds to texts really
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
quickly so i'm sure she gets a lot of
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
those pictures and that's a very fast
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
way to get an answer eight o'clock at
 
00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.589 align:start position:0%
way to get an answer eight o'clock at
night

00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
four o'clock in the morning
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
i get responses really fast
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative huff for a question
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is a big
 
00:38:12.079 --> 00:38:15.349 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is a big
question

00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is a very difficult problem i can
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
relate to it
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
on my family's property
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
we used to have crystal clear water when
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
i was a kid i could drink it i could
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
open my eyes under the water and see as
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
clearly as i'm seeing you right now
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
now there's milfoil in it
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
in a perfect situation
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
and we are all agreeable
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
what do you want from us that we can
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
give you to help either make this stop
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
or mitigate it the best and i say this
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
like a wish list don't hold back what
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
money what legislation would you like to
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
see to make it work
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
i hate things to always come down to
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
money because it's part of the answer
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's not the entire answer but funding
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
is really important um
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
amy can tell us about the backlog of
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
what she cannot fund and then it's also
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
things where people
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
just give up
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
so they're not even applying for fun so
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
i think that's a big part of it
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
i think michelle you touched on another
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
thing which is we're sort of
 
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.790 align:start position:0%
thing which is we're sort of
climbing

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
climbing
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
a bell curve
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
of where what tends to be older retired
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
people are doing this work because they
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
have time they live on a lake
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately that's something we're
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
seeing a decline and we're not able to
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
find as many new younger volunteers as
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
we once wore
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislation i think is key
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult question as you said or
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
a big question because
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is the live free or die state i was
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
born here i'm part of it and it's
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to regulate and tell people
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
what they can't do it's easier for us to
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
talk about what people can do
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
so we might need to craft our messages
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
and legislation
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
to talk about cans and incentives for
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
those better behaviors
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
so that's my thought and michelle and
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
amy and madam chair
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
would welcome your input on that because
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
it is a big question and we want to make
 
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.030 align:start position:0%
it is a big question and we want to make
sure

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
that you hear everything that we're able
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
like the lady said this is a
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged approach so we need the
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
prevention we need the early detection
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
we need the long-term management so all
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
of those things need to be supported
 
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.870 align:start position:0%
of those things need to be supported
further

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
we need more clean drain dry systems for
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
prevention around the state for people
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
to do disinfection and decontamination
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
of their watercraft so these things stop
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
spreading we need more volunteers out
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
there to weed watch and report things
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
early to me so we can do management and
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
then we also need the funding for that
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
management we did an exercise where we
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
evaluated what it would cost each year
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
to control the 91 infested water bodies
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's a 10 million ticket each year for
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
a few years and then it you know of
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
course we'll taper down as we get ahead
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
of the big infestations that are out
 
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.430 align:start position:0%
of the big infestations that are out
there

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have those resources
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
we're only managing half of the water
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
bodies that are infested and that's a
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
matching grant program
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
so in 2022 we're projected to spend six
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars on milfoil and fan war
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
and water chestnut control on just half
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the water bodies across the state
 
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.150 align:start position:0%
of the water bodies across the state
so

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't even include the more
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
complicated systems like river systems
 
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.589 align:start position:0%
complicated systems like river systems
so

00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
resources for prevention and control are
 
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:52.950 align:start position:0%
resources for prevention and control are
critical

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
we are currently in the exotic aquatic
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
weeds and species committee putting
 
00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.589 align:start position:0%
weeds and species committee putting
together

00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:58.390 align:start position:0%
together
a

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
the plan that michelle mentioned that
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
will help bring in a little bit of
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
federal dollars but it will also
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
identify a strategy going forward to
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
enhance the program so we'll probably at
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
some point be coming back with
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
additional items not this year or next
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
year but probably you know coming in the
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
next few years to tackle that
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
and which water body are you referencing
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
year every couple years
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
um they come through and they treat and
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know they give us the warning don't
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
go swimming or let your pets near the
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
water for a day or two
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
and it seems to
 
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.230 align:start position:0%
and it seems to
have

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.270 align:start position:0%
have
uh

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
it hasn't cleared it out
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
but it it stops it from continuing i
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
mean is this still i have to go through
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
the 20-foot
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know swim of grossness to get out to
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
the to the center before it's it's it's
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
clear um so you know i can totally
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
relate to this stuff and that's why i
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
was i was curious yeah so for all the
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
water bodies to kind of wrap into all
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
we do this layered approach of
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
prevention early detection management so
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we can try to get ahead of the
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
infestations so ultimately if you are on
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
a water body or work with a water body
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have any of those layers
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
present we should work to get those
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
built up pagas does have a lot of those
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
built in
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we've been working our way through
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee as a whole and as you know
 
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.430 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee as a whole and as you know
winnipesaukee

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
is large and we've had to address all of
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
the infestations in all of the towns
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
before we address pagas otherwise
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's no point in addressing it
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
because everything flows through pagas
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
so you are
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the holding pattern but we are slowly
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
working our way through pagas too but
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
yeah if you are related to working with
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
living on a water body that has an issue
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
feel free to reach out and we'll get you
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the queue for management or i can
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
provide you with an update of where we
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
are with with management
 
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.270 align:start position:0%
are with with management
yes

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
and one last thing
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
on that question is something called
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
command model
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
and my father was in the army and navy
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
so you never know who you're gonna cheer
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
for in a football game but
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
he uh he can still
 
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.730 align:start position:0%
he uh he can still
okay

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:26.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
the command model is something that a
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
lot of states have explored because this
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
is something that you use in an
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
emergency this is something that you use
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to something like a flood
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
and invasive species can be an emergency
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
and so i went through an exercise where
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
we brought in different agencies to talk
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
about the command model and it's
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
something to consider in the future
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
maine had a hydrilla infestation
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
in a basically a fly-in kind of pond
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
and all of the agencies tried to come
 
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
together and there were many obstacles
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
to it so having a command model in place
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
to begin with could be part of a rapid
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
response plan
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
um and we talked about that that's sort
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the third step in that continuum so
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that in the future i'm
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
going to turn things over to madam chair
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
unless there's any other questions but
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's a whole other discussion
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of an exciting discussion
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
two to have because that could be the
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
way that we are able to jump into action
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than let something get out
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
we do have a hearing
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
at nine
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
at 9 45
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
is i know we've seen one person has
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
signed up is there
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor here
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
i don't see the the prime sponsor i
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
don't see the prime sponsor for the
 
00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:06.150 align:start position:0%
don't see the prime sponsor for the
uh

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
452 so i'll
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
let this go a little longer until i see
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor come in
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh you have a question uh representative
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
post oh we got lots of questions
 
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.109 align:start position:0%
post oh we got lots of questions
martin

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
martin
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
no i just thought we were going to close
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
so uh well i i i will close uh
 
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.190 align:start position:0%
so uh well i i i will close uh
well

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
actually you haven't had a question yet
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh for you know actually i don't have a
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
question i think i have information if
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is senator
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro he is currently
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
why i was late
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the senate committee on ways and
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
means hearing
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1598 which is the
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
commercialization cannabis bill which is
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
very popular today and so there's a lot
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
of folks over here
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
oh here we go look at that okay
 
00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:49.910 align:start position:0%
oh here we go look at that okay
okay

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.670 align:start position:0%
let's say
um

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i will i will close the presentation
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
and in part answering uh representative
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
huff's question but also to everyone is
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
just about every bill related to aquatic
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
invasive species comes through this
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
committee and usually we give the
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
presentation early in the session when
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
there is pending legislation there was
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
no legislation this year but if you hear
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
us talk about the enabling legislation
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the best available technology that
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
came through this the decal for
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
out-of-state voter
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
voters any increase in registration fees
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
usually passes pretty easily because
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
everyone wants it to happen because they
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
all know the value of
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
fighting aquatic invasives but anyway so
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so important to for us
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
to be giving this presentation to this
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee so if legislation comes up
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
next january you'll go aha i know what
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
about this is about so
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
but thank you for your time and it's
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
been a pleasure to be here on this side

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
what is this
 
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:17.190 align:start position:0%
what is this
452.

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
when i'm doing three things at once we
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
end up with a rather large and long
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.430 align:start position:0%

all right is
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
i have one card so far for uh
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
452 we have another one okay and uh
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

sponsor
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
of a senate bill 452
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
relative to leaded drinking water
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose of senate bill 452 fn is to
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
protect protect drinking water in
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
schools and child care facilities
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
the issue is that children are being
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
exposed to lead through contaminated
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
drinking water in schools and child care
 
00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:13.349 align:start position:0%
drinking water in schools and child care
facilities

00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
no amount of lead is safe for a child to
 
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.470 align:start position:0%
no amount of lead is safe for a child to
ingest

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
ingest
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
even small amounts of lead can result in
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
irreversible irreversible harm including
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
loss of cognitive ability and behavioral
 
00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:25.990 align:start position:0%
loss of cognitive ability and behavioral
problems

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
the best way to protect children is to
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
prevent lead exposure in the first place
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium the water trust
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
gave the department of education 1.8
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars to remove lead pipes
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
from schools and to deal with lead in
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
schools drinking water i might say to
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge about 70 000 of
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
that 1.8 million has been spent now
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
obviously schools were closed because of
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
the covet problem
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
but but indeed the 1.8 million dollars
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
specifically to deal uh with this
 
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.150 align:start position:0%
specifically to deal uh with this
problem

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
the epa reported that lead in drinking
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
water contributes to 20 percent
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
of a person's total exposure to lead
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a result sb 247 enacted in 2018
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
requires that schools and child care
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
facilities must test their drinking
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
water for lead results from the
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent tests revealed widespread
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
lead contamination in schools throughout
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i think about 20 000 tests
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
are still a matter of record this bill
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
will retain those tests so people will
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
be able to to use them as a as a point
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
with ninety percent of schools
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
conducting tests forty percent of those
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
schools reported lead in drinking water
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
twenty-five percent of the results
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
reported led between one and five parts
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
per billion
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
ten percent of the results uh revealed
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
led between five and fifteen parts per
 
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
led between five and fifteen parts per
billion

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
billion
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
five percent of the of the results
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
reported and led over 15 parts
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
per billion currently schools and child
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
care facilities are only required to
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
remediate lead in drinking water when it
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
exceeds a federal standard of 15 parts
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
per billion
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
the federal standard of 15 parts per
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
billion is not a health based standard
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
it comes from ees lead in cup and copper
 
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
it comes from ees lead in cup and copper
rule

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
the epa's maximum standard for lead and
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
drinking water is zero
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
the american academy of pediatrics
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
health-based recommendations is for no
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
more than one part per billion of lead
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
in in drinking water
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
sp 452 solution to this problem is
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
removing lead and drinking water by
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
establishing a health-based limit of one
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
part per billion now the bill says up to
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
five parts per billion but so that's a
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
change that has has taken place the bill
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
requires schools
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
and licensed child care facilities to
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
test drinking water for lead and to
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
notify parents of tests with with high
 
00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.190 align:start position:0%
notify parents of tests with with high
standards

00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh the bill has been amended in the
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
senate you have you have the amendment
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
the results of the tests are retained
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
and up to five parts per uh per billion
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
has been taken into consideration
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
i can't express my concern for how
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
important this is
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
i as a youngster dealt with lead pipe
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
my father was a plumber i was an
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
apprentice to my father and we would go
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
into homes and buildings that had lead
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
pipes because that was the way you
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
you piped water in the old days
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
there are many uh
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
many places where that still exists the
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
lead pipe has been constantly removed
 
00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:40.549 align:start position:0%
lead pipe has been constantly removed
and

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's the proper thing to do
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
but indeed in schools as i said the 1.8
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars came from the trust it
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be used uh
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
to take care of light problems in in
 
00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:54.789 align:start position:0%
to take care of light problems in in
schools

00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
and uh as i said because of
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the culvert problem only about
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
70 million has been used 70 000 has been
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
used so there's money available to do
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
this and it's very very important
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
all of all of you who have children
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that they spend time
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
obviously in school a great portion of
 
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.510 align:start position:0%
obviously in school a great portion of
their

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.549 align:start position:0%
their
their

00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
primary care is taken is taken care of
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
in a school and they use the bubbler and
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
they use drinking water in the schools
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with problems with drinking
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
water for a long period of time
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
at one time in my life i was president
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
of manchester water works and we take
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
pride in our water in manchester
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
it's as good as any any in the state and
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
we sell a lot of it to to different
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
communities in the state but we have a
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
process of treating that water which i
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
think is extensive
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
it's very important and it's among the
 
00:55:46.799 --> 00:55:47.750 align:start position:0%
it's very important and it's among the
best

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
treatment of water
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
that exists in the country so we've
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
taken taken steps we need to take more
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
steps here so i thank you very much for
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony i
 
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.390 align:start position:0%

i apologize for that fact that i have to
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
leave because i'm in ways of means and
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
we're having a committee hearing on
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%

smith for a question
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um i do realize
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
there was a house bill uh
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
very similar to this
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
and we also had a bill earlier this year
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh related to pfas and drinking water
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the big issues sticking
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
points we came up against was
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
testing every outlet
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
was going to be
 
00:57:20.119 --> 00:57:21.750 align:start position:0%
was going to be
cross-prohibitive

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
cross-prohibitive
 
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.589 align:start position:0%
cross-prohibitive
and

00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
i noticed that this bill has a testing
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
of every outlet which is every drinking
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
water fixture in the school
 
00:57:31.119 --> 00:57:33.349 align:start position:0%
water fixture in the school
and

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
i know that the house bill as
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate talks about
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
installing water bottle filling stations
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
would you have an issue with putting
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
that option into this bill so it would
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
be less cost prohibitive to test every
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
outlet oh thank you very much for you
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
for your comment and your question i
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
know i i i don't have any problem we we
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
heard that bill yesterday in senate
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
finance about the uh
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
the water containers and and uh
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
no i don't have any i don't have any
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
problem with that as long as it's safe
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
is the safety of of people as i'm sure
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
is as a concern of everybody uh before
 
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.510 align:start position:0%
is as a concern of everybody uh before
me

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.710 align:start position:0%
me
so

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
our best
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have the tests that have been taken
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
and we have that as a in a depository
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
we've got that data to look at so i have
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
no problem with you with your question
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
and obviously we want to keep the costs
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
down but as i say
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
we've we've a pro
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
via the the trust we've got 1.8 million
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
there for the schools that they could
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
use and that
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
you know that's available and that's
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
obviously a cost
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
a cost saving situation because they get
 
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.510 align:start position:0%
a cost saving situation because they get
it

00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
they get to use it and the doe is
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
responsible for the repayment
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you bib
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much seeing no other
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the committee
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative creighton and then
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
see if we can get the senator back to
 
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
his marijuana bill all right
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
um

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
the bill makes sense there's two things
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
completely understand the first is
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
you've got the january 2016. is this
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
what i don't understand is is why are we
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
tests that have already completed what
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
required those tests
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
and and does this bill add on to some
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
previous legislation
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question i'm not
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
sure there have been a number of bills
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually there are a couple that are in
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
place as we speak and there has been
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
previous legislation and the tests that
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
have been taken
 
00:59:40.799 --> 00:59:41.750 align:start position:0%
have been taken
uh

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
that they were a matter of record we
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
want to retain those tests and retain
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
that database so we could look into that
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
but this bill is required then to
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
make more tests the other bills no
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
longer valid
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
no the the tests are valid
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the the other the other legislation
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's running too talks about 180 day
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
period that's rather confusing the one
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we that we uh looked at
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday i think this is a a clearer
 
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.950 align:start position:0%
yesterday i think this is a a clearer
situation

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
and i think uh is much much easier to
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
much easier to dissect and move forward
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
with okay thank you
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
follow on please
 
01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:19.829 align:start position:0%
follow on please
yeah

01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned one part per billion
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
um but in a bill it says five parts per
 
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.549 align:start position:0%
um but in a bill it says five parts per
bill

01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
you addressed it but i didn't catch
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
be we'd love it to be one part per
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
billion but we we the latitude is up to
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
five parts okay so the bill is set at
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
five yes with one as a stretch goal but
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's not right but no no nothing greater
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
than five thank you thank you
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much seeing no other
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much let you
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
get back to
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
the business at hand yes
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know i once had a bill to introduce
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
gaming into the state i know
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
this this
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
this is an analogy they go on forever
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.839 --> 01:01:15.030 align:start position:0%

conservation law foundation
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the chair
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for hearing
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
so clf strongly supports this bill sb
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
452 which does build on previous bills
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
that have required all the schools to
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
test for lead in their drinking water
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
and to remediate that lead
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
the prior bill was sb 247 which what
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
passed about i think was 2018 and that
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
required all the schools in licensed
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
child care facilities to test for the
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
presence of lead and the schools have
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
been doing that since that time and they
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
in fact had started testing before that
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
and that is why the bill dates back to
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
2016 so that
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
we capture all those tests the schools
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
have already invested in and i
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
understand the schools have already done
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
about 23 000 tests so it's quite a lot
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
so we want to um not throw out those
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
testing results so
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
the bill so the schools are already
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
testing for lead
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
but currently
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
they only need to remediate that lead if
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
it hits over 15 parts per billion or
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
higher and that's quite a high amount of
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
lead there is scientific consensus as
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
you heard from the senator that no
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
amount of lead in a child's bloodstream
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
is considered safe even a small amount
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
can lead to permanent brain damage for a
 
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.870 align:start position:0%
can lead to permanent brain damage for a
child

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
with that scientific consensus that the
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
no amount of blood lead in their blood
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
is safe
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
we need to limit the amount of lead that
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
children are receiving through their
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
drinking water and the epa estimates
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
that a person can get up to 20 percent
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
lead exposure through drinking water so
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's a significant source
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
the current level at f at 15 is not a
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
health based level it's tied to the
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
epa's lead and copper rule and epa
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
itself says that is not a health based
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
limit so it's not meant to be used to
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
set a health level for lead and drinking
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
water and the epa has an unenforceable
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
maximum contaminant level goal so epa's
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
suggested level is zero lead in drinking
 
01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:36.309 align:start position:0%
suggested level is zero lead in drinking
water

01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
the cdc also recommends zero and the
 
01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.430 align:start position:0%
the cdc also recommends zero and the
american

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
american
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
american academy of pediatrics
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
specifically recommends a limit of one
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
let one part per billion lead in school
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
drinking water so there's
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
consensus around this zero to one you
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
know depending where the test and limit
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
is as you heard the bill has been
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
amended up to five parts per billion
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
um we would still advocate for a lower
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
number but we but five is a huge
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
improvement over the current standard of
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
15 parts per billion
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
i would urge the committee to consider
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
a level of our neighboring states maine
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
and vermont both limit the amount of
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
lead in school drinking water to four
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
parts per billion
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
but four or five any of them are much
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
safer and more protective than the
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
current level of 15 parts per billion
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
there's significant cost savings that
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's a study by the pew center that
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
recommends that for every one dollar
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
invested in lead poisoning prevention we
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
could see as much as 17 return on the
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
investment because there's a lot of
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
societal costs and individual costs when
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
a child is poisoned by lead
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
and that those costs stay with them
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
through their lifetime so it affects the
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
child and there's a lot of societal
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
costs in special education and then um
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know as they're an adult even
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
through the criminal justice system so
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
investing in lead prevention upfront
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense both for the child
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
and for our society
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
and so on that and i'll just say that in
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
in previous before the senate the
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
american academy of pediatrics the new
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society the new
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire school nurses association and
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal assistance have all
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
supported this bill
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
and so we urge you to
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
i i i cannot say who it was that how it
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
got negotiated out up to the five
 
01:05:55.039 --> 01:05:56.870 align:start position:0%
got negotiated out up to the five
um

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is the mechanism to reduce it
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
from the current standard of 15 down to
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
five or four or one so
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
i think it depends on where the
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
political appetite is for getting the
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you hit two of those
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
concerns so one of them is the
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
laboratory sensitivity and i i have
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
heard um but i des could speak to this
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
better but i understand that some labs
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
can test at one or at two you know
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
that's where their uh margin of error
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
where they're most comfortable some two
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
half a part per billion some to one and
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
some to two another concern is the
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
funding it was as you lower the number
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
you capture more faucets and systems
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
that need to be remediated and currently
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
there is a grant for funding
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the schools at five parts per
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
billion or higher so there's funding at
 
01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.670 align:start position:0%
billion or higher so there's funding at
five

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
although i understand that that grant
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:19.510 align:start position:0%
could be
the

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
requirements of that grant could be
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
amended it could be made lower so it
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
could apply to remediation at levels of
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
between one and five
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:46.390 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
all right i'll
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
no that is through the um
 
01:07:55.599 --> 01:07:56.390 align:start position:0%
no that is through the um
the

01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative grassy then followed by
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative huff
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
what's here in five uh in 452 uh a lot
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
of it has been integrated into house
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
bill 1421 which is in senate finance i
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
guess just yesterday
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
and it's got a lot of other stuff that's
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
in there is is 1421 hospital 1421
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
is that something you would support as
 
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.229 align:start position:0%
is that something you would support as
well

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
in general we do support the use of
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
water bottle filling stations which is
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
in 1421
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think the con
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
the concern about filling stations is
 
01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:46.309 align:start position:0%
the concern about filling stations is
that

01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
the other taps or sources of water in
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
the schools still need to be tested
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
so currently filling stations are used
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
as a remediation technique
 
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.030 align:start position:0%
as a remediation technique
and

01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
we we would be fine with filling
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
stations as an alternative to testing as
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
long as the with a couple caveats the
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
other taps including like food
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
preparation areas or classroom sinks
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
where you know i know my children are
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
not always going to the water bottle
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
filling station if there's a classroom
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
so you still need testing at the other
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
sources and remediation
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
and um you know the filling stations
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
have to be um up to certain you know
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
standards nsi standards to make sure
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
that they are reducing lead at the
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
represent representative huff
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question um how many
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you know
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
the stat but how many uh school-age
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
children a year in new hampshire
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with lead
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
poisoning i should know that statistic
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i don't know it off the top of my
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
head do you know
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
no i know dhs dhhs tracks those numbers
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
and they are available on their website
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a significant amount it's
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
alarming how many children in new
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire are poisoned by that
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up for a follow-up
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
i know you don't have the number but my
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
next question presuming that we can get
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
that number would be how many of those
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
can be linked to the school that they
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
attend and i don't believe that dhhs has
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
linked any of those exposure cases to a
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
specific school what we do know so the
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
children are kind of tested in two ways
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
their blood is tested at the
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
pediatrician's office at age one and two
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
although with the pandemic those numbers
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
the testing numbers have dropped off
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
significantly so a lot of children are
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
not being tested right now
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then the school drinking water is
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
tested and we have those results and we
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
know from those results that there is
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
lead in the school drinking water so
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
those are kind of two ways of knowing
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
how children are being exposed to lead
 
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
how children are being exposed to lead
and

01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
we would be in favor of tackling lead in
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
all the avenues that children are thank
 
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.430 align:start position:0%

facility drinking water for lead
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
we've passed out
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
a letter of testimony from des that was
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
also emailed to the committee yesterday
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
and attached to the letter there is a
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
copy of the language of the current
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
language of h bill hb 1421 as well as a
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
table on the last page that summarizes
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
the key
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
differences and similarities between the
 
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.669 align:start position:0%
differences and similarities between the
bills

01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
des is not taking a position on this
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
bill but we would ask the committee to
 
01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:18.630 align:start position:0%
bill but we would ask the committee to
consider

01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
adopting provisions that are in hb 1421
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
so you'll see on on the summary the main
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
difference with hb 1421 is that there
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
was a provision added whereby schools
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
and child care facilities could have the
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
option of installing water bottle
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
filling stations in lieu of testing and
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
remediating every outlet
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
at their facility
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
and in the language that's included in
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
hb 1421 it has provisions about how many
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
station water bottle filling stations
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
should be installed and what type should
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
be installed
 
01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
be installed
the

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
the station should be tested after
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
they've been installed to confirm that
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
they're removing lead and then part of
 
01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:09.830 align:start position:0%
they're removing lead and then part of
that

01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
approach is also
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
posting the other outlets and fixtures
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the school and making sure that those
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
are not accessible for drinking water
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
unless they've been tested and
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
remediated so all of those
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
those details are spelled out in the
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
so it really gives schools the option
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
and schools and child care facilities
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
the option of doing this route of
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
testing and remediating every outlet
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
about five parts per billion or
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
installing water bottle filling stations
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
and directing children and students to
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
be using those to fill their to fill
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
their water bottles
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
des feels that this approach would give
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
schools and child care facilities the
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility and feasibility to be able
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
to reduce exposure to lead and drinking
 
01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.709 align:start position:0%
to reduce exposure to lead and drinking
water

01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
and just for just for context there are
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
about 750 licensed child care facilities
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
and about 630 schools
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the state so almost 1400 facilities
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
that are required to do testing under
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
and from the first round of testing
 
01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:21.030 align:start position:0%
and from the first round of testing
it

01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
on average schools have been testing
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
about 32
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
outlets or 32 fixtures at each at each
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
school and about seven fixtures at each
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
child care facility so that has resulted
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
in about 21 000
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
individual faucets that have been tested
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
and we have about 23 000 test results
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
for for those
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's all take any questions if anyone
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
has questions thank you all right
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative spang and then
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
um so last time we looked at this issue
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think it was determined that it didn't
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
make sense to test every
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
every outlet because the source of the
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
lead came
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
from the pipe that served the whole
 
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
from the pipe that served the whole
school

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
so why not just test that
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a change in thinking on
 
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.350 align:start position:0%
there's been a change in thinking on
that

01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
that
so

01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of so lead is something that
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
has been historically used in plumbing
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
fixtures and is actually can be in the
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
faucet itself it can be used it was
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
historically used in solder for
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
piping so it actually can be picked up
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
within a facility so you could have two
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
sinks and two different classrooms one
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
could have lead one
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
may not have lead so it really for lead
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
is one of those contaminants that's very
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
important to test or to really
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
understand everywhere you're drinking
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
what the lead concentration is so other
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
contaminants it's you know as long as
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know what's coming out of the pipe
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's coming into the building you know
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's not going to change but let is
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
unique in that way right
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up for a follow-up thank you or
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
this is actually another question
 
01:17:08.239 --> 01:17:09.669 align:start position:0%
this is actually another question
um

01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
so i i'm a little um
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
at a loss here for for how to implement
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
the des recommendation
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that we don't need
 
01:17:23.199 --> 01:17:24.709 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that we don't need
452

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
452
 
01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:25.830 align:start position:0%
452
if

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
um if the other bill 421 is passed
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
or is there an amendment that
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be made to one of those bills
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
to integrate the two
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
so i i am not familiar enough with the
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
details of the legislative process and
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
how that would work but we would
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
recommend that the provisions of 14 21
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
be included in sb 452 and then how they
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's up to up to
 
01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.550 align:start position:0%
you know it's up to up to
um

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature so i'm not you know i i
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
think our concern is that that that
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
we've got two different bills and just
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
trying to have a holistic approach and
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
really trying to understand ultimately
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
what the what the changes are going to
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
be to the statute
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair is is this worth pursuing i'm
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly if you look at the back
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the uh yeah it was handed out you'll
 
01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:23.990 align:start position:0%
of the uh yeah it was handed out you'll
see

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
four fifth
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
14 21
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh has
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
water bottle filling stations and
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh this bill sb 452 does does not at the
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
presence right
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
so my question is i guess
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
going forward here
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh 1421
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
right now does not have some things that
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
are important
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
that are in 452
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
not that i well you could you could read
 
01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.229 align:start position:0%
not that i well you could you could read
the

01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i've taken a look at it
 
01:19:00.239 --> 01:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
yeah i've taken a look at it
and

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's i'm just trying to i guess the
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
easiest thing would be if des would say
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
that their interpretation of the letter
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
is that we don't need 452. they very
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
seldom will take that
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
isn't that what their letter is saying
 
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:18.870 align:start position:0%
isn't that what their letter is saying
uh

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
you can read what they said
 
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.110 align:start position:0%
you can read what they said
knowing

01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know knowing most
 
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.149 align:start position:0%
you know knowing most
administration

01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:19:28.159 --> 01:19:29.669 align:start position:0%
administration
responses

01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
responses
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
they s
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
unless it's
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
they they will not take sides they will
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
just give you their information well i
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
was just asking for clarification of how
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
to interpret that what they actually
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
wrote in their letter
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
you can you can ask them as
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think i think maybe
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
we'll move on then okay thank you
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
you might have also additional comments
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
by any members relative to her question
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh grassy i think uh you
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
had your hand
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative egan that it's okay we
 
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.030 align:start position:0%
representative egan that it's okay we
refer

01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
refer
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then then i'll go to go to you
 
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.070 align:start position:0%
and then then i'll go to go to you
representative

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.550 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative grassley then and
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
then i'll go to representative most of
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
the things if i'm correct to phrase this
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
as a question i think it's it's if i'm
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
correct here most of the provisions that
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
are in 452 were included in 1421 as part
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
of the senate amendment is that correct
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct so basically what you're
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
looking at is 452 that we have before us
 
01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.070 align:start position:0%
looking at is 452 that we have before us
here

01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
is in
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
1450 is is in 1421 uh and the five parts
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
per billion
 
01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
per billion
um

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's just a testing standard
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
that if it's anything's below that and
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
the provisions in in the senate bill
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
that we have before us today are pretty
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
much already included in the house
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
version that was passed by the or that's
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
before the senate right now i haven't
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
heard what the standards are
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
what their decision has been that's
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
correct so when when hb 1421 was with
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
the senate education committee des
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
recommended that they include the
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
provisions of sb 452 that were not
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
included so um to make to make for
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
consistency and to really understand
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
what the you know the implications for
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
for the question mr chairman just to as
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
far as the the water filling stations
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
are concerned that was something you
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
folks recommended is giving an
 
01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:32.870 align:start position:0%
folks recommended is giving an
alternative

01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
to local facilities that may have some
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
problems with certain specific
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
water stations
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
you know water outlets and it also did
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
include if i'm not mistaken in here one
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the comments that was made by a
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
previous speaker was that they were
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about cooking facilities you
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
do require that anything that's used for
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
cooking has to meet the lower standard
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
and be tested
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
that that's correct unless you're using
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
a water bottle filling station for
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
cooking you know i'm not sure the
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
mechanics of that then you know if you
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
have using a kitchen sink for cooking
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be required for testing
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
um and so i think you know the bottle
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
filling station approach could also
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
alleviate schools from having to test 32
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know that that's the average some
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
schools would have you know over 100
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
outlets that they would have to test and
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
track uh so this would you know give
 
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
track uh so this would you know give
them

01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
give a more potentially more efficient
 
01:22:26.639 --> 01:22:33.510 align:start position:0%
give a more potentially more efficient
approach

01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
and representative post
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative cullen
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair
 
01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:41.990 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair
um

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um you
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that roughly 21 000 tests are
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
done or have been done within the last
 
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.669 align:start position:0%
done or have been done within the last
year

01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
since 2016. since 2016. but i noticed in
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note tied to your testimony
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
in 1421 that you're requesting that the
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
des would then need to add another staff
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
person is are we not already staffed to
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
do this and why
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
would des need to add to that and
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
secondly it says in there that
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
first two years come from federal funds
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
but then the general funds would be
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
needed to support this position
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
thereafter but the senator in his
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
testimony noted that we have
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars in the trust fund
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
for drinking water and groundwater
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
contamination remediation so
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
why would the
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
des ask
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note to be applied here
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
and create more funds out of the general
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
fund that would then
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
cause taxpayer issues
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
so share some insight
 
01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.149 align:start position:0%
so share some insight
sorry

01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
so the the uh the program manager
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
position the position that i that i'm in
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
is a part-time temporary position that
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
was created about a year ago and it's
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
funded from a grant from u.s epa
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
and so that we have funding for the next
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the funding is going
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
to be like beyond that
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating an additional
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
allotment from epa but we don't know the
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
specifics of what that's going to look
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
like and i would anticipate that we
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
would use a lot of that funding for
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
remediation but i'm not sure at this
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
point that'll be determined over the
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
next few months and so i think with the
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for the additional
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
funding for
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note for a staff position
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
currently the way the existing statute
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
is written is that there's no
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide the data to des
 
01:24:39.679 --> 01:24:40.790 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide the data to des
uh

01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
most of schools that have tested have
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
provided data about we've got data from
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
about 95 percent of schools that have
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
tested uh they're required to provide
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
data to des if there's an exceedance but
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise they're not required to
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
provide data and so one of the changes
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
in both of these bills would be that
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
facilities are would be required to
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
submit data so there's additional work
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
on the department's standpoint from in
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
terms of tracking those data and making
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
sure that you know that that we have all
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
the data and any follow-up testing and
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
remediation information so those are the
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
um the reasons for the additional
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
position time and then in terms of the
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
the funding from the groundwater and
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund that is a remediation
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
only grant for schools for 50
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and so that doesn't
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
include any uh funding for staff time
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
for um administering that grant
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
so just a quick follow-up mr chair if i
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
can clarify so
 
01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.950 align:start position:0%
can clarify so
um

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
so this would require schools to test
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
and therefore that's why you have the
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
needed staff and the needed staff would
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
need to come from funds because the
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund is for remedy remediation
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
yes so the existing statute requires the
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
testing but there's no requirement to
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
give the data to dea so that's the
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
difference and we have federal funding
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
for at least two years for the position
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
but beyond that if just you know staff
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
time is needed there may or may not be
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
federal funds available thank you so
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
i just want to go back a little bit we
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
were talking about the idea of water
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
being tested and
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
area of food and food prep
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
in my town
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
the elementary schools do not cook their
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
phone food anymore they hire companies
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
that bring it in
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that covered by this do those
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
companies have to be tested or is there
 
01:26:42.719 --> 01:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
companies have to be tested or is there
any

01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
kind of information on that i don't i
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
don't think so i believe as the current
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
statute is written and as these bills
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
are written it's the facility
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
is required to do any testing of water
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
in their facility
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative post and followed by
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative cullen
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
your testimony today um my question is
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
once these faucets are tested and there
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
is no presence of lead or there is it
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
meets the requirement
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
is there continual testing after that
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
the required 180 days or
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
how does that work in terms of the
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
faucets or the filling stations the
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
faucets so there's uh the way the the
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
current statute is written as there's
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
three rounds of testing that are
 
01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.149 align:start position:0%
three rounds of testing that are
required

01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:27:34.159 --> 01:27:35.110 align:start position:0%
required
and

01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
i believe the language in the current
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
sb452 and in hb 1421 would require three
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
rounds of testing so most schools and
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
child care facilities schools have done
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
one round of testing already so they
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
would need to do two additional rounds
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
of testing so there would be follow-up
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
so there would be no more testing
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
after the three rounds
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
correct if they were less than the
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
standard then typically you would have
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
if you had a faucet that was high and
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
you replaced it with a low lead fixture
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
we would
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
require that that that outlet be tested
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
you flush flush the line run the water
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
through it and test it again to make
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
sure that that actually addressed the
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
issue and that would be considered part
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
of like one testing round and then you
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
would still need to do another testing
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
round sometime later to confirm that it
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
was still
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
on on the 180 days for the dispensing
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
water dispensing stations is there a cut
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
off on that as well or is it ongoing
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
always for testing
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
so i believe that the way that that's
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
written now is that it's a test within
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
180 days to make sure that that it's
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
working properly and then beyond that um
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
no i don't think any
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
testing would be required but if there's
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
there would be maintenance that would be
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
required if there's a some of those
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
stations have filters that are included
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
those would need to be maintained and
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes another follow-up so so they don't
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
have to do any more testing they just
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
have to be responsible for the
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance on a schedule correct all
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative cohen
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr speaker mr speaker i
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
have a question um of the speaker here
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairperson on the comparison chart
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
but if you decide the question should be
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
redirected to representative grassy i'm
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
fine with that okay thank you for taking
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
my question on your comparison chart
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh you say that the standard and the
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill is five parts per billion
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
and it says in the house bill
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
15 parts per billion so is that
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
if both bills are passed as amended
 
01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:53.189 align:start position:0%
if both bills are passed as amended
today

01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
the senate bill will have a much lower
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
standard required
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
so sorry i should clarify on the on the
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
chart that the the first column is hb
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
1421 as it was passed out of the house
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
and originally it did it didn't change
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
the standard it left it at the 15 parts
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
per billion and then when hb 1421 was
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
being considered by the senate education
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee that's when the
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
it was it was
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
changed to have a standard of five parts
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
per billion so in its current form it
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
does have five parts per billion thank
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
01:30:34.239 --> 01:30:36.149 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative mayfield
 
01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.990 align:start position:0%
representative mayfield
mayfield

01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
mayfield
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
i have to go back to some basics here
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
because i'm failing to see a link i
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't negate the impact of lead in our
 
01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.629 align:start position:0%
don't negate the impact of lead in our
water

01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
but my five children are all tested when
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
they're about 15 months of age so it's
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
between the ages of one and two
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony is telling us that
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
why are these children being tested then
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
later are there some developmental
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
problems that we're seeing rampantly and
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
suddenly we're saying look we need to
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
test these kids for lead because there's
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
a problem here and the cdc says the
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
greatest risk
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
to um with health problems is to
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
children that are exposed under the age
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
of six yet we're talking about all of
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
the schools in the state
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
so i guess i need to see a link between
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
the tests that we do when they're
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
toddlers at age one or two
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
and then the school-aged children that
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
are coming up with this lead exposure
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
when you know my understanding is lead
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
can be found in water but is much more
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
prevalent in lead-based paint in toys
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
from other countries um candy from other
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
countries cosmetics cleaning supplies
 
01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.350 align:start position:0%
countries cosmetics cleaning supplies
so

01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
i i need some help getting to that point
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
of i'm testing a kid at the age of one
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
or two he's exposed in the home now
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to the point of there's lead
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
in the schools and all these children
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
are you know have lead poisoning so
 
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
is it the schools or is it the home
 
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.310 align:start position:0%
is it the schools or is it the home
[Music]

01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
there there is a requirement that kids
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
are tested at ages one and two and if
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's elevated lead concentrations
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
then that triggers an investigation by
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
and they go in and they visit the home
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
and they look for any kind of potential
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
appealing pain or other exposures they
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
test the water so that's a that's a
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
separate process
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding and i'm not i i
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
i work with that that program to support
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
them with the water testing results um i
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
will say that for the testing
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
that i've seen there's only been a
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
handful of cases where there's been lead
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
in the water in the home
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that that was
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily the cause
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know we just provide support on on
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
the lead results so i'm i'm generally
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with the program but uh
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
there there could be older potentially
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
older children that get roped into an
 
01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.790 align:start position:0%
older children that get roped into an
investigation

01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
if if there's an issue but i'm not
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
really familiar with the details of that
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that there's any
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
widespread testing done of school-aged
 
01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
widespread testing done of school-aged
children

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
so where do we get the statistic of this
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
20 of lead poisoning is in school-aged
 
01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.830 align:start position:0%
20 of lead poisoning is in school-aged
children

01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
i believe that was
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
20 of exposure comes from lead and
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.880 --> 01:33:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.990 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
i will close the hearing
 
01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:15.860 align:start position:0%
i will close the hearing
on

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:15.870 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:17.830 align:start position:0%

senate bill 452
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
we will be taking up
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
the we will be executing
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill 452
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
during the executive session that is
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
presently scheduled for
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
10 45 however
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
we are going into caucus
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
the republican caucus and the democrat
 
01:34:43.119 --> 01:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
the republican caucus and the democrat
caucus

01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
in all probability that is going to take
 
01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
in all probability that is going to take
longer

01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to take longer than
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.270 align:start position:0%
for uh
uh

01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
well it would be more than 15 minutes
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
in all probability it will take
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
at least a half an hour i would guess
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
there's some controversial issues but
 
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:07.910 align:start position:0%
there's some controversial issues but
so

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh we will be postponing
 
01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.030 align:start position:0%
uh we will be postponing
the

01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
actual executing till at least 11
 
01:35:15.679 --> 01:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
actual executing till at least 11
o'clock

01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh i will put a note on the door
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
that we will be you know postponing
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
because this the
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
republicans will be meeting in this room
 
01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.830 align:start position:0%
republicans will be meeting in this room
and

01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative smith here
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
in room 403
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh i'll ask
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative smith to have her her
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
cell phone on that when she's finished
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
to call us if the republicans are
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
finished first we'll call her so that we
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
can just
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
get back together again
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
because we may even go beyond the
 
01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.830 align:start position:0%
because we may even go beyond the
11

01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
11
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
1105. which will be
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
what i think we will
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
go to
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
i will ask that the room
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
be cleared you know we are not and with
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
the postponement is that for the or put
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
a note on the
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
door that uh we are going into a car
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
into caucus uh
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
and uh that
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
execs at 1105 or later you may see
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.270 --> 02:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
call the executive session to order we
 
02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:10.550 align:start position:0%
call the executive session to order we
have

02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:11.910 align:start position:0%
have
uh

02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%

i knew these things cut off too much
oxygen

02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative harb would you like to
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes although in
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
principle i can see the benefits of
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 452 i support the house bill
 
02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:38.190 align:start position:0%
senate bill 452 i support the house bill
um

02:26:38.190 --> 02:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
1421 as uh currently amended by the
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
senate i think we have some duplication
 
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:44.790 align:start position:0%
senate i think we have some duplication
i

02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
read the des reports so i moved to an
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on this
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative creighton to speak on
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
your uh on your motion
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
i concur with uh representative hart
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
it was saying to me that one bill that
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
accomplishes the same task would be
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
much preferable than two bills that
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do the same thing
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that the house bill
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
laid it out better
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
than the senate bill and with less
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
sir anyone else
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative connors speak on your
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
speak on the on the bill
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um well i do agree that 1421
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
seems to be the best alternative here
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
would it make more sense
 
02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
to do an otp on 452 and then make a
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
motion on the house floor to hold this
 
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
bill by tabling it
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
until we know what happens with
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
02:27:57.030 --> 02:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
on the motion
 
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
rep representative cohen yes thank you
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my speak on us i i agree with
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative connor and since for an
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
executive session could i ask you to
 
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
but we
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct but we are having a
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
discussion where we any of us could
 
02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
change our our what we're thinking of
 
02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
change our our what we're thinking of
voting

02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.150 align:start position:0%
voting
so

02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
did representative connors
 
02:28:31.439 --> 02:28:32.309 align:start position:0%
did representative connors
uh

02:28:32.309 --> 02:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
our discussion
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
possibly i don't know what your vote's
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to be i'm assuming you're going to
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
support the itl at this point
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
does it influence you in any way
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
where you may think that that might have
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
some validity or weight that doesn't
 
02:28:47.429 --> 02:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a reasonable thing to do based
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
on this new information that she
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
provided to you
 
02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:52.830 align:start position:0%
provided to you
uh

02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
well only we're all the information
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
should right around now the information
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
that i hear is only a suggestion
 
02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:02.389 align:start position:0%
that i hear is only a suggestion
and

02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's all others may
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
think differently representative grassy
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
then followed by representative harp
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
yes uh mr chairman i um
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
i sort of agree um with representative
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
cronus i think that instead of otp i'd
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
rather see it
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
oh yeah as otp
 
02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:21.429 align:start position:0%
oh yeah as otp
yeah

02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:29:22.950 --> 02:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'd want to see it as ought to pass and
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
table it because i think one of the
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
concerns we have is basically the
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
entirety of 452 is in 1421.
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh 452 is a good bill
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
the thing is is that if the senate
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
finance committee decides not to and the
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
senate its wisdom decides not to pass
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
1421 we end up with nothing
 
02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
what is in
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
452 is basically some minimal standards
 
02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
which we should be approving anyway
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i and i just have a fear that if we
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
have it as
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
interim study we've lost our opportunity
 
02:29:57.910 --> 02:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
for this year if the senate does not
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
pass 14 15 14 21
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh so i i think that we should have you
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
know we should vote ought to pass and we
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
should vote to table it when it comes to
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
the floor so that it's there
 
02:30:12.150 --> 02:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
depending what the senate does if the
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
senate passes 1421 we just leave it on
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
the table if the
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
senate defeats 1421 we pull it off the
 
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
table and we we do it that way i mean
 
02:30:26.469 --> 02:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
the basic provisions of 452 in 1421
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
1421 passed out of the senate five to
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
nothing out of the senate education
 
02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:30.790 align:start position:0%
nothing out of the senate education
committee

02:30:30.790 --> 02:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
five to nothing
 
02:30:34.630 --> 02:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking at that i think
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of support in the senate
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
for the bill but you really don't know
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do until they take
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
that final vote so it's just a concern
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm looking at the docket of hb 1421
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
and uh it says the committee report has
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
from the senate that's out of the
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
education not the finance committee from
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
what i understand they haven't voted on
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
it yet and it's not due to the floor
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
until 4 28.
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
that that was my comment was that i
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
would endure sorry if i may miss chair
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
um i just checked and it actually came
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
out of senate finance voted in favor of
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
it 7-0
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
so just today then we don't have a
 
02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:34.870 align:start position:0%
so just today then we don't have a
problem

02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%

pass with amendments okay mine was

do i have a second
 
02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:19.280 align:start position:0%

02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
right
uh

02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative smith do you wish to
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
improves upon a situation that we have
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
run into in the
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
area of hampton falls to hampton harbor
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the marshland there which two three
 
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
years ago we passed legislation
 
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
prohibiting personal watercraft in that
 
02:34:51.680 --> 02:34:52.790 align:start position:0%
prohibiting personal watercraft in that
area

02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
but we then found out
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
once the bill was enacted the law was
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
enacted that there were people who had
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
their personal watercraft in that area
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
and they couldn't get out
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
and it was very limiting and so this
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill um makes it so they can be in that
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
channel only in the channel
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
but going at headway speed which is the
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
lowest speed you can go
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
to not create any wake
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
and then last year we had a bill which
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoed which prohibited
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft in the area of the
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
newcastle rye estuary area and we even
 
02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
went on a field trip um probably a week
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
before we shut down from coven
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
and so that bill was vetoed for a
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
similar reason
 
02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:43.590 align:start position:0%
similar reason
probably

02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:44.630 align:start position:0%
probably
because

02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
anyone who already had a personal
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
watercraft there couldn't get in or out
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
of that area
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
so this bill also adds that area at
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
headway speed to that
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
area of newcastle
 
02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:01.030 align:start position:0%
area of newcastle
and

02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
and rye
 
02:36:06.870 --> 02:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the areas outlined in the rye and
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
rye harbor marsh
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
are the parameters which marine patrol
 
02:36:14.309 --> 02:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
said would be very easy for them to
 
02:36:14.319 --> 02:36:15.990 align:start position:0%
said would be very easy for them to
patrol

02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
patrol
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
so it's i think it's a good bill and we
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
briefly yes i think we've this has some
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of logic in this bill and that's
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
why i support it
 
02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:35.670 align:start position:0%
why i support it

uh ebola just like to speak on your
 
02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:45.110 align:start position:0%

02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative harp thank you mr chair
 
02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:48.870 align:start position:0%
representative harp thank you mr chair
uh

02:38:48.870 --> 02:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:50.950 --> 02:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
the bill is an interesting bill i do
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
think it needs further study i've looked
 
02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
at the testimony from the board of
 
02:38:59.429 --> 02:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
realtors and other parties concerning 50
 
02:39:02.469 --> 02:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
of all septic systems are private in the
 
02:39:02.479 --> 02:39:03.429 align:start position:0%
of all septic systems are private in the
state

02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh i think this bill as presently worded
 
02:39:09.510 --> 02:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
might have unintended consequences but
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to study it further hence my
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak on your second
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh just briefly i concur with
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative harp and the financial
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
implications of this bill require study
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
but it is a worthy cause of
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh we need to study that
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
a way to get nitrogen
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
out of the great bay area thanks very
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
to anyone who's just to speak on the uh
 
02:39:54.309 --> 02:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's been killing the bill for sure
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
but um i feel that
 
02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be studied in order
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
to make it workable
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
because it's basically enabling
 
02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislation the details will be worked
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
out by each municipality
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
according to what
 
02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
according to what
their

02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
their financial needs are their
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure capability is
 
02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
and what uh the
 
02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:26.469 align:start position:0%
and what uh the
their

02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
residential property owners
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
are interested in doing
 
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
um i feel that the
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
the lack of understanding
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
which was
 
02:40:40.870 --> 02:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
greatly exacerbated by the realtors lack
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
of understanding of the bill
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
is more a matter of
 
02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
this committee becoming more comfortable
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
with it and understanding that the
 
02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
financial problems that are being
 
02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:59.030 align:start position:0%
financial problems that are being
suggested

02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
are really a non-issue
 
02:41:02.479 --> 02:41:03.830 align:start position:0%
are really a non-issue
so

02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:04.790 align:start position:0%
so
the

02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:07.070 --> 02:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to be seeing more
 
02:41:09.429 --> 02:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities that adopt
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
the stormwater utility which will make
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
everybody more comfortable with how that
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
whole mechanism works
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
and then of course how this would
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
play into it also
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
so although i'm disappointed not to be
 
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
able to pass this and
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
give it an opportunity to to
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
be tried out
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
or at least to be discussed by at the
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
municipal level to decide whether it has
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
possibilities for each municipality
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
i do think that it's very important that
 
02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
this idea be kept alive
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
as the
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
chair of the shoreline septic system
 
02:41:56.479 --> 02:41:57.750 align:start position:0%
chair of the shoreline septic system
commission

02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
we realize that something must be done
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
about the enormous amount or percentage
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
of nitrogen that is coming out of
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
individual septic systems
 
02:42:14.309 --> 02:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's a bear to attack because of the
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
concern about private property rights
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the costs of upgrading
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
an individual septic system
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
as des said there are programs out there
 
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
to help munici uh individuals to upgrade
 
02:42:34.150 --> 02:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
their septic systems
 
02:42:37.269 --> 02:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
um and we i think that
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we explore
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
so i as i say i would
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that we interim study
 
02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
this one not to defer it but to actually
 
02:42:57.269 --> 02:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
do some serious study of how it will
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
work get some input from municipalities
 
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have any use for
 
02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:05.750 align:start position:0%
i don't have any use for
the

02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:06.950 align:start position:0%
the
realtor's

02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
realtor's
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
input on it because i think that they're
 
02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:10.550 align:start position:0%
input on it because i think that they're
misleading

02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
misleading
 
02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:11.349 align:start position:0%
misleading
but

02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i i support the
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:21.269 --> 02:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else with
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:23.830 align:start position:0%
with the
comment

02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
comment on the bill representative smith
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:43:34.830 --> 02:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
i would agree with representative spanx
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
summation as much as i would like to see
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
this enabling legislation passed i do
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
understand concerns about the costs
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
because it it is
 
02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know it is an unknown factor but the
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
gr the area of the great bay has been
 
02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:52.550 align:start position:0%
gr the area of the great bay has been
under

02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say attack but you know
 
02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:44:00.150 --> 02:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
the epa and the ms4 permitting and the
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant upgrades that
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
are not covering a hundred percent of
 
02:44:07.030 --> 02:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
the problem of the nitrogen and we do
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
know that home septic systems are a huge
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh issue
 
02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
and we also have interim studied another
 
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill on shoreline septic systems so i
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
truly hope that by interim studying this
 
02:44:23.429 --> 02:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
that we really are going to study the
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
two of these bills because they both
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
have to do with shoreland septic and
 
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
discharges into our lakes the great bay
 
02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
ponds and rivers
 
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think i need to say something
 
02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
first i've got to probably
 
02:44:46.710 --> 02:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
reevaluate what's going on because i
 
02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
happen to agree with the father
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
the previous two speakers
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
we do need
 
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
to actually spend a lot of time
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
to determine what exactly this
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
this means and what also
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
what this but this bill meant
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
and also how to address the issues
 
02:45:09.279 --> 02:45:10.550 align:start position:0%
and also how to address the issues
around

02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
around
uh

02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
was it mp4
 
02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:16.230 align:start position:0%
was it mp4
mp4

02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
mp4
 
02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:17.349 align:start position:0%
mp4
uh

02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
ms4 well it's close
 
02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:21.429 align:start position:0%
ms4 well it's close
that

02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:21.439 --> 02:45:22.230 align:start position:0%
that
those

02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
i also say that this bill
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
as it was written
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
i would never have considered what
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
i would never have expected the
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
testimony to say the things they did and
 
02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
describe what they did
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
based on this bill reading it
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
stuff was very
 
02:45:52.790 --> 02:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
it maybe it was me but it was
 
02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
when the testimony basically showed that
 
02:46:01.269 --> 02:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
they were going to have the authority to
 
02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
that uh did when i hear someone say well
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to charge everybody with a
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
septic system of fifteen hundred dollars
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to drop uh
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
the when they when we find that they've
 
02:46:16.389 --> 02:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
done certain things that we like we'll
 
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
give them some rebates
 
02:46:19.349 --> 02:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:46:19.359 --> 02:46:20.630 align:start position:0%
uh uh
no

02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
i so we d we the legislature has to be
 
02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:27.349 align:start position:0%
i so we d we the legislature has to be
doing

02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
has to
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
retain the power
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
of taxation and we cannot delegate it to
 
02:46:33.439 --> 02:46:34.309 align:start position:0%
of taxation and we cannot delegate it to
the

02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
to the local authorities but beyond that
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
but to get back to the actual
 
02:46:43.349 --> 02:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
amendment or the actual uh
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
motion i i also agree with the with the
 
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:49.040 align:start position:0%

colleagues first i'd i'd like to just
 
02:49:35.269 --> 02:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
start by uh
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
saying i think we can all agree
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
that the preservation of our national
 
02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
heritage as well as our state heritage
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
the goal of our our nation at the time
 
02:49:57.510 --> 02:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
of being free um hadn't been realized
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
yet for all citizens
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
um the relics and gravesites and remains
 
02:50:03.429 --> 02:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
and preserves recorded
 
02:50:05.590 --> 02:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh deserved being recorded and preserved
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
and celebrated
 
02:50:10.230 --> 02:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
now with that said there were several
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
issues that i had with this bill and i'd
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
like to just bring them up
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
for you
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
to understand why i think it's important
 
02:50:20.389 --> 02:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
the first and foremost difficulty i had
 
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
with with the bill is in the um
 
02:50:27.990 --> 02:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
is what the senator uh
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh in testimony
 
02:50:32.469 --> 02:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh alluded to as far as uh
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
changing one of the definitions and one
 
02:50:37.110 --> 02:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
of the definitions that was changed
 
02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
or added i should say was
 
02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:43.510 align:start position:0%
or added i should say was
for

02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
the african-american descendant
 
02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
the african-american descendant
community

02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
the definition in this was means persons
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
of african-american
 
02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:52.870 align:start position:0%
of african-american
descent

02:50:52.870 --> 02:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
descent
 
02:50:55.269 --> 02:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
residing in the municipality
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
or designated representatives which
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
makes absolutely sense and then he added
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
the black heritage trail of new
 
02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:02.710 align:start position:0%
the black heritage trail of new
hampshire

02:51:02.710 --> 02:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
which he testified to us was
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:19.349 --> 02:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary responsibility that should
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
be carried out by the state
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
basically given to a private entity
 
02:51:24.399 --> 02:51:27.670 align:start position:0%
basically given to a private entity
um

02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
it also goes on to mention um
 
02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the in in the entirety of the bill
 
02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
all of the different um statutes that
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
already deal with this subject
 
02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:40.870 align:start position:0%
already deal with this subject
um

02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
as far as uh discovery as far as finding
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
out what what they need to do with it
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
they've all been addressed they're
 
02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
already in statute and if there was ever
 
02:51:51.269 --> 02:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
a catch-all
 
02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
um for something that they didn't know
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
how to handle or didn't know what to do
 
02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:56.070 align:start position:0%
how to handle or didn't know what to do
with

02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
um they referred to it in to the um af
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:52:03.429 --> 02:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
native american statutes
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
which handle any of these things
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the major problems that
 
02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
i had with this
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
so i i really think it it needs to be
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
looked at also another just a a piece of
 
02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
information i looked up um because it
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
was concerning to me about this uh
 
02:52:22.230 --> 02:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
there are other
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state
 
02:52:26.230 --> 02:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
that also do
 
02:52:29.349 --> 02:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
what the uh what the foundation of the
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
black uh heritage trail of new hampshire
 
02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:32.790 align:start position:0%
black uh heritage trail of new hampshire
does

02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
so why this was specifically um
 
02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
singled out
 
02:52:39.269 --> 02:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to speculate
 
02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
but i think it needs to be looked at
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there's an answer
 
02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
that that can be had and and i think an
 
02:52:48.309 --> 02:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
interim study would be able to address
 
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
these concerns
 
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'll take any
 
02:52:58.230 --> 02:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:59.830 --> 02:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
i agree with the representative and um
 
02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh believe this is the right thing to do
 
02:53:09.030 --> 02:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
put it in an interim study
 
02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wish to speak
 
02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative cohen
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
i appreciate um the motion that there's
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
a sentiment to fix a problem
 
02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
but i feel that
 
02:53:31.030 --> 02:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
this bill will start to address the
 
02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:32.070 align:start position:0%
this bill will start to address the
problem

02:53:32.070 --> 02:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear in my interpretation of
 
02:53:35.750 --> 02:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
that if the one organization that was
 
02:53:40.389 --> 02:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
listed that's culturally sensitive to
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
the issues would actually be able to
 
02:53:42.479 --> 02:53:43.670 align:start position:0%
the issues would actually be able to
mandate

02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
that this
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
the state of the local municipality
 
02:53:49.349 --> 02:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
has to spend a certain amount of money
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
in a certain way and i feel that putting
 
02:53:54.790 --> 02:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
this to interim study will delay this at
 
02:53:56.790 --> 02:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
least another year before something
 
02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
happens so i will not be supporting
 
02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
the interim study that do appreciate
 
02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
that there is some sentiment for this
 
02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:06.790 align:start position:0%
that there is some sentiment for this
bill

02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
represent representative
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
smith for
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
you were
 
02:54:18.630 --> 02:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair um i think that
 
02:54:22.230 --> 02:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
the in my study of the various groups
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
the black heritage trail appears to be
 
02:54:26.710 --> 02:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
the one that has the most broad
 
02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:28.070 align:start position:0%
the one that has the most broad
influence

02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
influence
 
02:54:31.870 --> 02:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
and uh does the most for the
 
02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
african-american black community
 
02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:36.070 align:start position:0%
african-american black community
and

02:54:36.070 --> 02:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:36.950 align:start position:0%
and
they

02:54:36.950 --> 02:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
do a lot of workshops and studies and
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
although the senator may have been one
 
02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
of the founders of the organization they
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
have a a large group they have an
 
02:54:48.389 --> 02:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
executive director they've got a board
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
of directors it's not a one-man show and
 
02:54:53.110 --> 02:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
it you know i'm not sure when it was
 
02:54:54.870 --> 02:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
founded i'm sure it was quite a while
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
ago you know 10 years maybe
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
so i think that that is kind of
 
02:55:02.710 --> 02:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
irrelevant and i think that having when
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
you have someone who is
 
02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh they don't know who
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
the you know i think that adding that to
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
the mix is a good idea i mean if you
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to just take that out that would
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
be fine but other than that i think it
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
is a bill that is long overdue
 
02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
there has been so much work being done
 
02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
in the last
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
few years especially and
 
02:55:28.389 --> 02:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was a
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
state where a lot of black people did
 
02:55:32.070 --> 02:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
migrate to
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
either escaping slavery or
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
moving here because there was a more a
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
free it was more able to be a free
 
02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
person here
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
and so i think that this bill is
 
02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:44.630 align:start position:0%
and so i think that this bill is
necessary

02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
and for the heritage
 
02:55:49.030 --> 02:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
of the people and the heritage of the
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
state so i will be voting against the
 
02:55:56.830 --> 02:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:58.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:58.399 --> 02:56:00.309 align:start position:0%
okay
now

02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
is there any oh
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
pardon yes
 
02:56:10.710 --> 02:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
you could you can speak then
 
02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:12.950 align:start position:0%
you could you can speak then
representative

02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
in principle that
 
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
there are people on this committee who
 
02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
there are people on this committee who
really

02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
support this
 
02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
and i am wondering what is the harm
 
02:56:31.269 --> 02:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
in passing it
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
i mean we can nitpick our way through it
 
02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:34.550 align:start position:0%
i mean we can nitpick our way through it
but

02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:35.830 align:start position:0%
but
overall

02:56:35.830 --> 02:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
overall
 
02:56:37.990 --> 02:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think that there is a lot to be gained
 
02:56:40.630 --> 02:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
from it and i just don't see that there
 
02:56:43.429 --> 02:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
any of this stuff that we're bringing up
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
i also will be opposing the
 
02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
interim study i think this bill is
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
overdue honestly and i know
 
02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:03.110 align:start position:0%
overdue honestly and i know
that

02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
my dealings with african-american
 
02:57:10.309 --> 02:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
people in my community and with the
 
02:57:12.150 --> 02:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
black heritage trail
 
02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
that it is really important to anyone
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
from any culture to be able to recover
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
the bodies of their dead and to give
 
02:57:21.750 --> 02:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
them a proper burial and i don't think
 
02:57:24.550 --> 02:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about any old you know i
 
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
know i understand that there are other
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
cultures and there are other situations
 
02:57:30.230 --> 02:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
and there are other laws but i bel i
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
believe that in a unique
 
02:57:33.550 --> 02:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance that we have with
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
african-american burleigh grounds in the
 
02:57:37.990 --> 02:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
united states that we should treat that
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
specifically and separately because a
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of people were tortured their bones
 
02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
were not respected they were used for
 
02:57:46.950 --> 02:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
medical experiments they were used to
 
02:57:48.389 --> 02:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
make products
 
02:57:49.750 --> 02:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
such as leather
 
02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:50.550 align:start position:0%
such as leather
so

02:57:50.550 --> 02:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
if there's just
 
02:57:55.990 --> 02:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
to me this bill is a matter of respect
 
02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'll be voting against
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:04.950 --> 02:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative grassy then then
 
02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:06.950 align:start position:0%
representative grassy then then
representative

02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:58:08.790 --> 02:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i i would also oppose the interim
 
02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
study on this bill i think it the bill
 
02:58:13.269 --> 02:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
is is very well written as far as as
 
02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue of
 
02:58:17.349 --> 02:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
african-american burial areas
 
02:58:19.110 --> 02:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
as someone who is a town planner for 20
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
years and served on a planning board for
 
02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
an additional 10 years in my local
 
02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:24.070 align:start position:0%
an additional 10 years in my local
community

02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:58:26.230 --> 02:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
i found many instances when we dealt
 
02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
with situations like this and in
 
02:58:30.309 --> 02:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
rochester we didn't have a large black
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
community at all so we never ran into
 
02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
these we ran into grave sites that were
 
02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
found during construction
 
02:58:37.990 --> 02:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
during the approval process and when
 
02:58:40.469 --> 02:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
when when the engineers and experts went
 
02:58:41.830 --> 02:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
out to the sites
 
02:58:43.349 --> 02:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
to find things
 
02:58:45.190 --> 02:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to anyone
 
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
we'd find unmarked graves or we'd find
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
graves that were
 
02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:50.389 align:start position:0%
graves that were
not

02:58:50.389 --> 02:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:58:53.190 --> 02:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
really documented very well
 
02:58:55.190 --> 02:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
and what this bill addresses is the fact
 
02:58:55.200 --> 02:58:55.990 align:start position:0%
and what this bill addresses is the fact
that

02:58:55.990 --> 02:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:58:57.269 --> 02:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with
 
02:58:59.429 --> 02:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
african-american graves there was a
 
02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
greater tendency not to document these
 
02:59:04.710 --> 02:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
things or not to mark them very well
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
and what we're doing is we're addressing
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
a wrong here
 
02:59:09.750 --> 02:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah you know uncle joe may have
 
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
been buried out on the back farm but
 
02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
when it came to those freed slaves that
 
02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
came to new hampshire that didn't have
 
02:59:17.269 --> 02:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
families in the area
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
they were many cases put into poppers
 
02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:20.550 align:start position:0%
they were many cases put into poppers
graves

02:59:20.550 --> 02:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
graves
 
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
or graveyards which were not well marked
 
02:59:24.550 --> 02:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
and as dealing with the new hampshire
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
heritage trail they're just a group that
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
if there is no descendant community in
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
that area that would basically take the
 
02:59:35.830 --> 02:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to pick up um the care of
 
02:59:38.070 --> 02:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
of these and what happens to these grave
 
02:59:41.510 --> 02:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
sites or the uh the the materials that
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
are recovered from these grave sites
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
including the bodies of of these uh men
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
and women who were buried there
 
02:59:49.269 --> 02:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that is is beyond the time
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
that we take some action on this
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
and again as someone who's worked in the
 
02:59:54.950 --> 02:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
community worked in the field as far as
 
02:59:56.230 --> 02:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
the development is concerned when we
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
find these things
 
03:00:00.150 --> 03:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
these black grave sites are just as
 
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
important as any others
 
03:00:05.590 --> 03:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times we stumble upon them
 
03:00:07.110 --> 03:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
and they should be given the respect and
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think that's one of the things that
 
03:00:09.990 --> 03:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does and i would hope that we
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
would oppose interim study we there's
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
really no need to study this any further
 
03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:20.230 --> 03:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else to speak on this bill or
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
with

03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:00:30.870 --> 03:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
all the respect for my democrat
 
03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
colleagues i
 
03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
will support the entry study
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
i will support it because i want to know
 
03:00:41.190 --> 03:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
what are the bills that we have going on
 
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
that support other communities not just
 
03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:44.790 align:start position:0%
that support other communities not just
that

03:00:44.790 --> 03:00:44.800 align:start position:0%

03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
black carriage um
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm probably like controversial
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
right now but um i just feel like
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have many other communities there i
 
03:00:55.830 --> 03:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
would like to see that happening
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
for that reason i will support the entry
 
03:00:58.319 --> 03:01:01.990 align:start position:0%
for that reason i will support the entry
