00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
with reports from Monday um and that is
 
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
important because um uh any early bills
 
00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 align:start position:0%
need to get reported out today um and we
 
00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
have one early bill on the schedule for
 
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
today that I think we can take care of
 
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh pretty easily um so we'll do that
 
00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 align:start position:0%
early this morning so we can get the
 
00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
report done and out on that um but I
 
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
think um talking to representative
 
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.550 align:start position:0%
think um talking to representative

Morris um representative TR would you
 
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your Amendment this is
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
a very simple Amendment it just kind of
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
tightens things up um one we discussed
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh whether we should include charter
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
schools in this because they needed to
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
be mentioned specifically if we wanted
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
to include Public Schools but uh on the
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
advice of of chairem my chairman um the
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
charter schools don't have athletic
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
fields this is about aeds and athletic
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
fields if this we find that this is a
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
problem down the road it's easy to amend
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
but at this point it seemed um
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
extraneous what we really wanted to to
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
talk about is the bill itself said that
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
the AED should be readily accessible at
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
each athletic event or venue and talked
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
about places where they might be maybe
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
four soccer fields together did we need
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
does that mean four um aeds or is one
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
enough um for that and what we did is
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
look back in the guidelines guidelines
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
from the American Heart Association for
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
example say um when you're doing an AED
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
plan plan for having something within a
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
three to five minute walk try to do the
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
best you can to get as much coverage as
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
you can and it really so we don't need
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
to put that in statute what we need to
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
do is say we're going to ref ref we're
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
going to refer to the guidelines and we
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
changed um it from at each venue is they
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
will be readily accessible to each venue
 
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
so the AED is in the area it's easy to
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
go from one field to the other but we're
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
not mandating that we have a AED on
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
every field physically and I think we
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
can try to that would that's the intent
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to make it as safe as
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
possible without going into really into
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
the weeds and the statute so I think
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
this covers that that very
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh represent Morris did
 
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:33.800 align:start position:0%

of introdu ction um I think this is
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes referred to uh as a sausage
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
making uh I I have made sausage in less
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
time than it took to deal with the four
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
sentences in the original
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
781 uh but found it to be a very
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
productive collegial uh discussion a
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort and so I I'm
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
delighted to uh uh to speak in favor of
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
of this amendment um just to highlight
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh a couple two or three changes because
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
I may not get them all um on line nine
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the amendment um we added the
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee added Boards of Trustees of
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
Chartered public schools in addition to
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
school boards of public
 
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
schools um we also added on line 10 uh
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
other personal electronic communication
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
devices in schools because even though
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
we're no longer in school any of us we
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
realize that there are other personal
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
electronic communication devices that
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
are coming that are in existence and
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
coming online all the time and we wanted
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
to be sure that those devices were
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
covered as well as uh the specific uh
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
item called cell
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
phones um if we go to uh line
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
11 uh the policy shall at a minimum
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of student personal
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
cell phones the change here in the in
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
the original language of uh
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
781 districts are encouraged to consider
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh such policy shall restrict the use of
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
certain student personal cell phones
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
during class instruction without
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
educator approval uh we want it to be
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
stronger than encourage because we see
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
this as such a a terrible problem that
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
is occurring amongst Our Youth and um
 
00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:14.839 align:start position:0%
particularly with respect to their time
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
in in our schools um and so we wanted to
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
make clear to those who are actually
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to implement this law which would
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
be the school boards and the boards of
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
Trustees of Charter Public Schools that
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
the policy we want to be very clear it
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
shall at a minimum restrict the use of
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
student personal cell phones during
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
class instruction therefore the language
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
is effectively permissive and
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to consider other times
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
during the school day that the local
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
school board or the chartered the Board
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
of Trustees of the chartered Public
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
Schools might want to include such as uh
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
the lunchroom or athletic fields some uh
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
just a couple of hypothetical examples
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
um if we move on we also added the
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
language in line 12 12 and 13 uh that we
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
we found helpful from the the governor's
 
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.470 align:start position:0%
we found helpful from the the governor's
budget

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
proposal um uh that the
 
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
policy um might have approved exceptions
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
determined by the superintendent or
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
their designate with respect to student
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
medical disability or language
 
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
proficiency needs we wanted to make that
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
clear to the school boards and to the
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
boards of Trustees of the chartered
 
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
Public Schools finally the last s the
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
next to the last sentence School
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
District policy shall not prohibit
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
students with medical needs such as
 
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
insulin pumps and glucose sensors or
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities from using a device to
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
support their learning as identified by
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
the IEP plan developed under Section 504
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
which is quite Broad and inclusive so we
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
didn't really believe that we needed to
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
go into a lot of detail uh rather by
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
referencing and including Section 504 of
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
The Rehabilitation Act of
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
1973 those who would be de developing
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
these policies would need to of course
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
reference those and then finally we went
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
round and around on an effective date um
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee agreed that we would
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
like to have this policy in we'd have to
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
have policies in place in our schools
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
beginning with the next school year
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
therefore the ACT shall take effect July
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 we were assured by the school
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
board's uh uh lobbyist Association
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyist that that would be plenty of
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
time for the uh the bodies to uh to
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
develop over the summer their policies
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
and to be able to implement them at the
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
beginning of the school year um thank
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman thank you uh
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the amendment
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative Hall did you want to
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.839 --> 00:46:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
chair

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.589 align:start position:0%
chair
yes

00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with the need for um a
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
policy um but the more I look at the
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are outlined from 11
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
line 11 down um I'm concerned that we
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
are telling the schools what the policy
 
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.309 align:start position:0%
are telling the schools what the policy
will

00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
be 9 10 11 said they need to create a
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
policy which is their prerogative sort
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
of like
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum then we get down from 11 on
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
we tell them exactly what's in there
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
which is not our role in my
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you thank you
 
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
discussion no further discussion on the
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
amendment uh then um Madam clerk could
 
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.309 align:start position:0%
amendment uh then um Madam clerk could

to pass as amended please thank you
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
second by representative Terry uh
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
otpa I AG I agree with this and and
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to my fellow Committee Member I
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
I would even like to see it a little bit
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
stricter because having done lunch duty
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
I I am concerned with watching to tables
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
of students on their phones are not
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
talking to each other and and that just
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
bothered me a lot and I I'd like them to
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
have to talk to each other so if
 
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.829 align:start position:0%
have to talk to each other so if
anything

00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully it could be weaned in a little
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
bit to make it a little bit
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
stricter repr would preferably with the
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
mouth closed while they're talking um
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
the represent my my concern is not the
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
policy I think we need a policy I think
 
00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:25.799 align:start position:0%
that I think the cell phon having been
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
in the school having been administrator
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
it's a pain in the neck that being said
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
I still don't think it's our our right
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
to delegate specifically what is in that
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
and similar to curriculum this is a
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
local option requiring the policy
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely by telling every school
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
system what it has to be without them
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
taking their own their own uh
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
prerogative I think that's not our place
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
you re
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
Hall Mr chair and to respond to that I
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
think it does
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
the school districts with a lot of
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
options are you going to let them use it
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
during lunch you going to let them it's
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't say Bell the bell I think
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
what we heard out here was a lot of talk
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
about the Bell to Bell and we we we
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
considered that and thought Bell to Bell
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
was letting this telling the the local
 
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
folks what to do this basically says you
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
got to make exceptions to the needs and
 
00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:23.799 align:start position:0%
during classroom instruction and again
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
it says personal uh devices so if a
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
teacher had devices available to all
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
kids that weren't their personal devices
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
because you could have a situation where
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
she has a cell phone she has a cell
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
phone I don't have one now what you
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to give me a cell phone so I think
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
it does give them a lot of leeway is it
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
you know your high school does this your
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
middle school does this your Elementary
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
School does this those are all options
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
available with this language I believe
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
thank you rent
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
Noble thank you Mr chair I I think what
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
we heard out of the hearing is that
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
they're they don't really want local
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
control they're looking for the state to
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
hand down the mandate to make it easier
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
for them to put these policies in place
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
so that it's not a fight with parents
 
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.710 align:start position:0%
so that it's not a fight with parents
and

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
kids that's how I took it anyway rent
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um and just
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
for one point of clarification I just
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
did want to make sure um that there
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't a potential um circumstance where
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
like classroom instruction where maybe a
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
scientific calculator would be brought
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
out for instruction or something like
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
that um that is a that is an allowable
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
use of the technology am I correct yeah
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
I I yes I don't see any problem in that
 
00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
regard yeah right represent Hall yeah in
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
response to that I would say it's not a
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
communication device so that would be
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
fine thank
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
you R Terry yes just want to respond to
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of the the comments and
 
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been
 
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.430 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been
expressed

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
um a good deal of of the 2 hours and 10
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
minutes that we spent on these sentences
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill was devoted to considering
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
uh the the delicate balance between the
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
state being prescriptive in terms of
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
what must be done and on the other side
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
um respecting local uh control and and
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
so that is for example why we um adopted
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
the phrase at a minimum with respect to
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
the policy at a minimum we're saying
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
there needs to be restrictions with
 
00:52:34.119 --> 00:52:35.789 align:start position:0%
there needs to be restrictions with
respect

00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
respect
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
to uh use of these devices during

bill seeing as we have um addressed some
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
of the issues with the last bill a
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
second uh any further
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Freeman just
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
briefly um we we've this is almost a
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
mirror bill of the last bill we passed
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
um about cell phone usage so at this
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
time I think retaining it and um either
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
giving it further examination or at some
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
point um voting to um itl it um would be
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
the prudent thing to
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
do thank you represent Terry yes uh I'm
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
in support of uh retaining the bill uh
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
in case something disastrous unforeseen
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
and disastrous occurs with respect to
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
781 uh I would like to to point out um
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
that in agreement with representative
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
Freeman that 781 and 131 are are
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
basically mirror each other um I did not
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
point out um before that um with respect
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
to 781 that the fiscal piece the
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation was was removed 131 does
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
not have the appropriation but uh
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
effectively with the bill that we're
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
going to be recommending to the Full
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
House and the bill that may be retained
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
um there were um several bills that we
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh not address um today and
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
recess them to uh next
 
00:59:42.029 --> 00:59:42.039 align:start position:0%
week um they are uh s House Bill
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
754 um there was an amendment passed
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
around this morning but um I think
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
people wanted additional time uh to look
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
at that Amendment so we will not take
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
that up
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
today um House Bill 12 21 related to uh
 
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
the parent advisory councils I still
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
think that we have some work to do in
 
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the formation of those councils
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
and who is who is going to do that um so
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
we will hold on that and um uh the prime
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor on House Bill 360 had requested
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
some additional time uh to look at that
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
bill as well um none of those are early
 
01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.510 align:start position:0%
bill as well um none of those are early
bills

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
um so we will um address them um at a
 
01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:32.710 align:start position:0%
um so we will um address them um at a
future

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
session um so let's move excuse me did I
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I mentioned House Bill
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
699 um uh I would include um to hold off
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
on that also because um evidently due to
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
my error we don't have copies of of
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
those um and uh I passed out duplicates
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
of 754 instead so um so uh we'll uh
 
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
we'll we I'll try and get copies for
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
next week of 699
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment um so uh that brings us to
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
361 prohibiting mandatory mask policies
 
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
and uh if uh she's ready I uh look to uh

that thank you Mr chair I move add to
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
pass thank you is there second represent
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
moris uh rent Noble would you like to
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
comment oh just a few comments actually
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
um this bill doesn't prevent masking in
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
schools anyone is free to do so they
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
just can't be mandated for
 
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
everyone it was mentioned in the hearing
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
that it's good that there's a car vote
 
01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
for IEPs in 504s but the thing is if
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't pass there is no car
 
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
vote for students with IEPs and 5 4S if
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
there is a school
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
mandate um there wasn't last time at
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
least we know enough now about the
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
impact on children to be able to do a
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
proper risk benefit analysis for any
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
potential Public Health event in the
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
future just like many of us parents did
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
from the beginning but there are some
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
that still don't know that and that is
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
one of the dangers in leaving this up to
 
01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.470 align:start position:0%
one of the dangers in leaving this up to
local

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
control I've read the online testimon
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
and emails opposing this bill and
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
there's really no acknowledgement about
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
how masking affected children and their
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
education if we were to have another
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency we can't leave
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
this to school boards to deal with we
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
can't have them in the middle getting
 
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
yelled at by two different sides we also
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
can't have one District that masks and
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
another that doesn't local control just
 
01:02:59.549 --> 01:02:59.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in this type of
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
situation also in um the online
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony there was a letter from the
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
um the division of Public Health
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
Services and I'll just read that to you
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
real quick um Department of Health and
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
Human Services Division of Public Health
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
Services is providing the following
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
information to the education Committee
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
in consideration of HB 361 relative to
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
prohibiting mandatory in mask policies
 
01:03:26.799 --> 01:03:27.990 align:start position:0%
prohibiting mandatory in mask policies
in

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
schools face masks remain an effective
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
tool for protect for protecting a person
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
and preventing the spread of many
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
infectious respiratory
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
diseases division of Public Health
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
Services continues to recommend that
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
decisions on face mask use be based on
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
individual choice and informed by a
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
person's own assessment and acceptance
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
of risk from currently circulating
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases rather than from
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
unversal requirements for
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
example individuals who are severely
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
imuno compromised or who desire
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
additional protection for themselves or
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
another household member can choose to
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
wear a face mask for their protection
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
when in indoor public locations this
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
recommend this recommended approach to
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
face mask is also consistent with the
 
01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
Centers for Disease Control and
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
prevention updated guidance on mask and
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
respiratory virus prevention
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
this information the department strives
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
to provide Public Health protection
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
while appropriately balancing individual
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
choice and I think thank director watt
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
for that um
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
letter and that's all I have I actually
 
01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:46.839 align:start position:0%
have the letter forgot about
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
all and that's all I have Mr chair thank
 
01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.870 align:start position:0%
all and that's all I have Mr chair thank
you

01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh represent morr did you have anything
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
to add no any further comment
 
01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.230 align:start position:0%
to add no any further comment
representative

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair I'll be voting
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
no on this itl I guess no
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
um school boards again it is local
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
control and no one can predict what's
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the future and I
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
think school districts School boards can
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
deal with the IEPs and I have complete
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
faith that school boards would take that
 
01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
into consider ation so I I'm voting itl
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
on this thank you further represent
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
Damon welcome to education policy again
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative DWI D
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
and I are trying to cover all
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
bases um I'm opposed to The Spill and I
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
speak as a healthc care professional now
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
retired um I would also note in the
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
online testimony there is a thorough
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
letter from the New Hampshire Nurses
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
Association opposing the bill um it is
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
critically important that we all make
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
our decisions based in fact and the fact
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
is situations could be different in
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
different districts and us on the state
 
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
level dictating what should or should
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
not happen in public health and safety
 
01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense I differ respectfully
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
with representative Noble in that we
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
should in fact benefit from each
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
district making the decisions that are
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
relevant you could have an outbreak of
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease in Manchester that
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
isn't affecting the North country or
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
vice versa the decisions should be made
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
locally thank
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you R Murray uh thank you Mr
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
chair I too will be voting no on the itl
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
and I think uh in in addition to
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's point one of the
 
01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
things that we saw were a myriad of
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
different dated dashboards during the
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
pandemic they came up that showed
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
various levels of um out um infection
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
rates and I think that that was a very
 
01:06:54.599 --> 01:06:56.109 align:start position:0%
rates and I think that that was a very
data-driven

01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
data-driven
 
01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take a look at where um
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
information was coming from based on
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
testing results that were coming back
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and that is
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
something that I think when we talk
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
about listening to science that was one
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
part of the local control aspect that
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
was very data and science
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
driven thank you rent
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you um surprisingly to
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
not I will also being voting no on this
 
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
but that being said I think we have
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
learned from the situation that the vice
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
chair talks about ways to move forward
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the future and by handcuffing local
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
schools and not allowing to use what
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
they've learned it makes no sense to me
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
um because the board the Health
 
01:07:42.269 --> 01:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
Community has learned the towns will
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
learn School boards will learn it's time
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
to let them do their job with new
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
information thank you thank you any
 
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.150 align:start position:0%
information thank you thank you any

n uh thank you very much
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
um let me see what else um we
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
have um house built 286 I think we can
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
bring up next um which is uh a study
 
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
committee to investigate if one one
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
school superintendent per county is
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
feasible um representative Freeman did
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
you have a motion on House Bill 286 yes
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I um vote to itl
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
this bill in expedient to
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you was there a
 
01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
second representative McDonald thank you
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
uh um represent Freeman did you want to
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
discuss your motion very briefly thank
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um while this in theory is
 
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
a good idea um I I do believe that we
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
already have an RSA on the books that
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
allows for districts to
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
consolidate um their saus and hence
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
would um address some of this problem
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
with the study committee on looking into
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
whether we should have one school
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent or not that and every
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
county is different um different sizes I
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
cannot in in good conscience say that
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County would be a good example
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
of having one superintendent so um to
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
that end I will um ask people to um vote
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
in expedient to
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you represent McDonald
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
did you have anything to yes I would
 
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
briefly I agree with representative
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
Freeman entirely I'll also add that we
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
have several study committees in law
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
already it seems needless to me to put
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
another study committee into law when we
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
could probably all answer this question
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
today it's probably not feasible you
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned Hillsboro County I would say
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
where I am and Rockingham County also
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
not feasible that's not to say I'm
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to SAU consolidation but I don't
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
think this bill is the answer to do that
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anything further
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just add we have a couple of sa
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
related consolidation bills uh still to
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh to bring up um I consider this in the
 
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
same vein um so um
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
we want to take a look at those other
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
two bills um upcoming but they're not
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
early bills so um you know please take a
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
look at those and I'll get those
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled um for
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%

uh this is a a non-gain Amendment uh to
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
HB 50 um it's the same general topic but
 
03:33:25.110 --> 03:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
it uh slightly revises the intent of the
 
03:33:25.120 --> 03:33:26.309 align:start position:0%
it uh slightly revises the intent of the
original

03:33:26.309 --> 03:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
legislation and that the original intent
 
03:33:35.469 --> 03:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
was repealing much of uh what was in
 
03:33:38.950 --> 03:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
statute U both in uh
 
03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
193 and in the uh human rights uh
 
03:33:47.070 --> 03:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
section of Statute um Rel ated to the
 
03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
topic of
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
Concepts um that some call divisive
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
Concepts um but uh they were concepts
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
related to uh I think equal treatment of
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
everybody um so what my Amendment does
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
instead is
 
03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
address some of the uh um rulings by New

judge's uh
 
03:34:40.750 --> 03:34:40.760 align:start position:0%

03:34:44.030 --> 03:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
here who can uh uh further explain where
 
03:34:46.630 --> 03:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
the uh case currently
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
lies um but one of the uh uh areas um
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
that was uh the basis of the lawsuit was
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
um vagueness um related uh to um
 
03:35:04.750 --> 03:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
violations of the educator code of
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
conduct and what might qualify in that
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
regard uh so uh my bill intends to
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
address though that vagueness that the
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
judge felt was inherent in the law and
 
03:35:24.870 --> 03:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
um it's not a lengthy uh Amendment as
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
you can see but Roman 3
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
and4 addresses violations by adding the
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
words intentional or
 
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
knowing so to be considered in a
 
03:35:40.630 --> 03:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
violation someone has to knowingly or
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
intentionally um act in this manner and
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
court um ruled that um this was
 
03:35:55.750 --> 03:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
vague uh in the original
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
Law um and uh it's uh the vagueness was
 
03:36:01.439 --> 03:36:02.710 align:start position:0%
Law um and uh it's uh the vagueness was
um

03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:06.790 --> 03:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
categorized um it does not include what
 
03:36:10.389 --> 03:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
was termed a scienter
 
03:36:14.790 --> 03:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
clause um and uh I can read from the uh
 
03:36:17.670 --> 03:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
judges ruling which basically quotes
 
03:36:21.750 --> 03:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
Black's uh Law Dictionary the scienter
 
03:36:24.110 --> 03:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
is the degree of knowledge that makes a
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
person legally responsible for the qu
 
03:36:31.030 --> 03:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
for the consequences of her or his act
 
03:36:31.040 --> 03:36:32.110 align:start position:0%
for the consequences of her or his act
or

03:36:32.110 --> 03:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:36:36.550 --> 03:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
Omission so this is meant to address
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
that um and make uh them responsible for
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
the consequences of their actions by
 
03:36:46.269 --> 03:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
indicating that the action has to be
 
03:36:48.429 --> 03:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
intentional or
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
knowing um and the judge in that New
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire case went on to say the value
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
of a scienter requirement is that it
 
03:37:03.030 --> 03:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
limits a laws scope to those who
 
03:37:05.790 --> 03:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
knowingly engage in a particular course
 
03:37:05.800 --> 03:37:07.110 align:start position:0%
knowingly engage in a particular course
of

03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:37:10.429 --> 03:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
conduct so the entire purpose of this
 
03:37:16.349 --> 03:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is to address that concept of
 
03:37:21.950 --> 03:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
vagueness um in the current law and um
 
03:37:25.750 --> 03:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we know that uh the
 
03:37:29.389 --> 03:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
intent of the person is intentional or
 
03:37:33.229 --> 03:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
knowing and that that would be a
 
03:37:36.110 --> 03:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
violation I thank you very much thank
 
03:37:39.469 --> 03:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:37:42.479 --> 03:37:45.550 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

03:37:45.550 --> 03:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:45.560 --> 03:37:48.429 align:start position:0%
 
Senate

03:37:48.429 --> 03:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Madame Vice chair um
 
03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Megan Murray I
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District 37 that is
 
03:37:57.750 --> 03:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
Amhurst in Milford I am a co-sponsor on
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill of house bill 50 and
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in opposition to the
 
03:38:16.189 --> 03:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
it stands to reason that unless the law
 
03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
is repealed by a house bill 50 that we
 
03:38:21.870 --> 03:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
have uh that we potentially further
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
encumber ourselves to litigation around
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of of um the bill
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
and the topic as amended with uh house
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill or excuse me Amendment 20250
 
03:38:36.910 --> 03:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
059 H
 
03:38:40.110 --> 03:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
059 95h the first amendment protects
 
03:38:41.950 --> 03:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
free speech and I'm not sure how this
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
amendment would compart with both the
 
03:38:45.550 --> 03:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
first and 14th amendments given that
 
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
some sometimes um honest yet
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable representations of
 
03:38:51.469 --> 03:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
historical truths could be construed as
 
03:38:53.950 --> 03:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
quote knowing violations when in fact
 
03:38:56.030 --> 03:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're just facts uh I urge the
 
03:38:57.670 --> 03:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee to vote no on the non-gain
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
amendment so that uh house bill 50 can
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
move forward unattached uh repealing an
 
03:39:05.870 --> 03:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law thank you thank you
 
03:39:05.880 --> 03:39:07.590 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law thank you thank you
any

03:39:07.590 --> 03:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:39:10.510 --> 03:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative dve thank you
 
03:39:12.349 --> 03:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question can
 
03:39:14.830 --> 03:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
you explain to me what is specifically
 
03:39:16.110 --> 03:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
on Con
 
03:39:18.030 --> 03:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
stitutional so I think there's a
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
potential for a conversation around the
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of of um there being
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
quote knowing or intentional
 
03:39:28.910 --> 03:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
representations of fact I I'm not quite
 
03:39:31.870 --> 03:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
sure how you would determine that um
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
when an educator is teaching in the
 
03:39:35.950 --> 03:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
classroom so I I feel like that could
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
become a very slippery slope where it
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
could be overly litigious and people
 
03:39:42.510 --> 03:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
could be uh and districts could be in a
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
situation where they find themselves uh
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
consistently in litigation follow thank
 
03:39:51.309 --> 03:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
you what in the constitution does that
 
03:39:53.550 --> 03:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
violate so when I was talking about the
 
03:39:55.229 --> 03:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
First Amendment free speech about on
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:00.429 --> 03:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
classroom any other
 
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative courtel so
 
03:40:06.830 --> 03:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so it sounds like
 
03:40:08.670 --> 03:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
this was put in to clear up the
 
03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
vagueness but it sounds like an
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
intentional or knowing violation could
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
also be considered vague because we
 
03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:17.030 align:start position:0%
also be considered vague because we
don't

03:40:17.030 --> 03:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
know if it how do you determine that it
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
was intentional or knowing so that that
 
03:40:25.150 --> 03:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
could be intent that could be vague also
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question I I
 
03:40:28.590 --> 03:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
believe so and I think that um that it
 
03:40:30.670 --> 03:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
further stands to put teachers and
 
03:40:32.429 --> 03:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
Educators in a position where they're
 
03:40:35.550 --> 03:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
constantly having to yet again defend um
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
what is a factual or historical
 
03:40:42.590 --> 03:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
truth any other questions representative
 
03:40:44.670 --> 03:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
Terry yes with respect to the the
 
03:40:46.990 --> 03:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
language that is in view most
 
03:40:50.110 --> 03:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
immediately um and upon which you have
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
opined an intentional or knowing
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
violation would you object to having the
 
03:41:00.070 --> 03:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
Court rule as to whether that is
 
03:41:03.389 --> 03:41:03.399 align:start position:0%
satisfies its concern for clarity as
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to your opinion being a
 
03:41:09.550 --> 03:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient basis not to go forward with
 
03:41:11.349 --> 03:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
this do you trust the courts to be able
 
03:41:16.189 --> 03:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:17.950 --> 03:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure I'm understanding your
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
question you said earlier in your
 
03:41:23.070 --> 03:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
opening statement that if we adopted
 
03:41:25.750 --> 03:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment that it would open us up
 
03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
to to unnecessary extended
 
03:41:31.830 --> 03:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
litigation did you not or I said that
 
03:41:35.189 --> 03:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
was a potentiality yes do you have a
 
03:41:36.750 --> 03:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
that litigation over Clarity of language
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
law I'm not sure what I'm understanding
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
that is just a fact of the judicial
 
03:41:49.469 --> 03:41:49.479 align:start position:0%
process what I am saying is that by
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
default it could potentially open the
 
03:41:53.309 --> 03:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
situation up to further litigation
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm saying uh recognizing
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we're not in the United States
 
03:41:57.870 --> 03:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
House of Representative I should
 
03:41:59.429 --> 03:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
probably defer now but I'd love to go on
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
for another three minutes
 
03:42:04.510 --> 03:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you any other
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
questions represent Cornell so thank you
 
03:42:09.670 --> 03:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair so if this did go into
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
litigation who would be responsible for
 
03:42:15.790 --> 03:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of the litigation it's a great
 
03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm not entirely sure but it
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
it it it would stand a reason that you
 
03:42:22.149 --> 03:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
would think that um if somebody was
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
being um implicated in knowing it could
 
03:42:27.309 --> 03:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
either be the educator themselves or the
 
03:42:30.110 --> 03:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
district it seems like that's how I was
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
so the taxpayers of the dist could be
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
liable for the cost of the litigation
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
potentially thank
 
03:42:40.309 --> 03:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm resident Timothy
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%

03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
district 10 the town of Durham and I U I
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
support the underlying bill I uh would
 
03:43:07.149 --> 03:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
have been happy to be a co-sponsor of it
 
03:43:09.630 --> 03:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
but um not not one of the names on the
 
03:43:10.830 --> 03:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
Mast head but I think that's an
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
excellent bill
 
03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
19340 um it's very bad law I me aside
 
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
from the fact it violates both the
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitution it's also
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
bad policy um we need to teach children
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
about uh about these Concepts what's
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
sort of has been um you know what's sort
 
03:43:30.429 --> 03:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
of been lumped at least by some under
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
the acronym Dei and what I should say
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
Dei stands for diversity equity and
 
03:43:37.710 --> 03:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
inclusion and those are three things I
 
03:43:39.790 --> 03:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
don't think any you know well maybe
 
03:43:42.750 --> 03:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
diversity but like we're diverse New
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a diverse State United
 
03:43:45.870 --> 03:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
States a diverse Society there's no way
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
around that and I'm not sure who's in
 
03:43:50.429 --> 03:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
who's in who who could be against Equity
 
03:43:52.269 --> 03:43:52.279 align:start position:0%
or against inclusion if you put it that
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
way but if call it Dei that's different
 
03:43:58.990 --> 03:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh me I don't necessarily I'm a
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
little bit uncertain about uh saying
 
03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
what's in the Constitution that's
 
03:44:05.790 --> 03:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
still still being observed and what
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
isn't but we have a state constitution
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
which also guarantees the right to
 
03:44:10.030 --> 03:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech and freedom of
 
03:44:11.790 --> 03:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
conscience so that's certainly still in
 
03:44:13.469 --> 03:44:13.479 align:start position:0%
place I mean I trust the courts more
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
than some other
 
03:44:18.510 --> 03:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
institutions I would uh but also I say
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's a process issue here which is uh
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
this bill hijacks you know the non-
 
03:44:28.149 --> 03:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment it uh completely
 
03:44:30.429 --> 03:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
replaces a bill and it has essentially
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
the opposite aim of uh of what the
 
03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
original bill was at least I mean it
 
03:44:37.550 --> 03:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
does add this language about intentional
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
or knowing I really don't know that that
 
03:44:41.149 --> 03:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
makes the bill any better it doesn't
 
03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
address um other problems just every sub
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph 193 40 has pro has problems um
 
03:44:49.269 --> 03:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
in ter we're talking about where the
 
03:44:50.910 --> 03:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
litigation is I me guess anytime you
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
guarantee people's rights um if the
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
rights are violated they can litigate
 
03:44:58.030 --> 03:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
and I looked at it looked at it and uh
 
03:45:00.149 --> 03:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
so you can either uh you can either
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
bring it lawsuit in the superior court
 
03:45:04.510 --> 03:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
or with the commission on Human Rights
 
03:45:06.910 --> 03:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
Commission on human rights uh has a lot
 
03:45:08.990 --> 03:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
of structural problems um so we probably
 
03:45:10.510 --> 03:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be adding any more work to the
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
commission on human rights and I don't
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
even I'm not even aware they've actually
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
like um taken on any cases uh inspired
 
03:45:22.110 --> 03:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
by 19340 but certainly this bill the
 
03:45:25.710 --> 03:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
amendment either uh
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't improve 19340 in any way
 
03:45:30.670 --> 03:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
or it may even actually make it even
 
03:45:33.189 --> 03:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
bager and it certainly doesn't attack
 
03:45:35.710 --> 03:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
any of the problems with it so in that
 
03:45:38.269 --> 03:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
regard it has exact opposite of intent
 
03:45:40.229 --> 03:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
of what the sponsors intended which was
 
03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
just to strike this uh strike this bad
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
statue from the law books well I guess
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
it did replace it with sort of a general
 
03:45:50.429 --> 03:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
statement of Ideal so from that regard I
 
03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
there's huge process problems with the
 
03:45:53.670 --> 03:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
amendment even though our rules do allow
 
03:45:55.590 --> 03:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
us to do it and it's uh I think somewhat
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
disrespectful to the sponsors to do it
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
especially since U this could have been
 
03:46:02.429 --> 03:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
attached to some other bills and i' I've
 
03:46:05.189 --> 03:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
had I've had bills I've had bills
 
03:46:07.510 --> 03:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
hijacked um in the past to do the
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
opposite of what I had in mind and uh
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's part of the game that
 
03:46:13.269 --> 03:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
we play here it's allowable but it's
 
03:46:15.389 --> 03:46:15.399 align:start position:0%
really not uh it's not a good t tactic
 
03:46:18.429 --> 03:46:18.439 align:start position:0%
and uh so it's really my opinion that's
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
probably not the right way to go about
 
03:46:22.110 --> 03:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
achieving the same I think it was a
 
03:46:24.189 --> 03:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
little bit unfair to to do that to the
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors especially since there's many
 
03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
other bills this non-ed amendment could
 
03:46:31.110 --> 03:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
have been attached to so I would just uh
 
03:46:33.670 --> 03:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
I just urge you to reject the I hope the
 
03:46:36.070 --> 03:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
committee will reject the uh reject the
 
03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
non-gain amendment but I hope they'll
 
03:46:39.510 --> 03:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
pass the underlying bill so
 
03:46:41.910 --> 03:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's U so that's that's all I have to
 
03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
say about it so pass the underlying Bill
 
03:46:46.349 --> 03:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
like reject the amendment and so I'd be
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if anyone
 
03:46:50.910 --> 03:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
has any but thank you any
 
03:46:54.469 --> 03:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
questions like represent Morse y thank
 
03:46:56.590 --> 03:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question here in the
 
03:47:00.269 --> 03:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
current statute RSA 19340 section 1A it
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
states teachers cannot teach one student
 
03:47:05.429 --> 03:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
of whatever race gender sexual
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
orientation or disabilities that they
 
03:47:10.830 --> 03:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
are superior to another so if repealing
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
HB sorry if we're repealing 19340 with
 
03:47:18.269 --> 03:47:18.279 align:start position:0%
hb50 then wouldn't that unbind teachers
 
03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
hands allowing them to teach students
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
that they are minorities and further
 
03:47:25.950 --> 03:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
propaganda on our students um I not sure
 
03:47:27.790 --> 03:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
how to not sure how to answer that I
 
03:47:29.910 --> 03:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
mean they that's something that they
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
should not have been doing um that was
 
03:47:35.229 --> 03:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
that was something would have been bad I
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't know of any cases where teachers
 
03:47:39.149 --> 03:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
are actually doing that um so I probably
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
think uh if I declined to answer your
 
03:47:43.349 --> 03:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
question I can point out you'll have an
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
executive session POS and work side so
 
03:47:46.750 --> 03:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you can discuss that with your
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
fellow committee members Andor if you if
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
you can find some instances of teachers
 
03:47:53.269 --> 03:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
doing that maybe you can share that
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
information with the committee but I you
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
know that was something was already like
 
03:47:59.149 --> 03:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
not allowed uh
 
03:48:04.349 --> 03:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
before um RSA 19340 was was uh rather
 
03:48:06.990 --> 03:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
hastily passing the law as part of the
 
03:48:09.950 --> 03:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh Budget Trailer Bill 40 years ago so
 
03:48:11.950 --> 03:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's about all the answer I have for
 
03:48:15.149 --> 03:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
that so thanks any other questions
 
03:48:19.149 --> 03:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:35.670 --> 03:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:38.229 --> 03:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
McKinley thank you chairwoman Noble and
 
03:48:39.550 --> 03:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
the members of the
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
committee I am Shannon McGinley I'm the
 
03:48:44.149 --> 03:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
executive director of Cornerstone action
 
03:48:47.229 --> 03:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
here in New I'm testifying on Amendment
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
0595 H to
 
03:48:52.750 --> 03:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
hb50 Cornerstone is New Hampshire's only
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
full-time Christian advocacy
 
03:48:56.149 --> 03:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
organization representing over a 100
 
03:48:58.510 --> 03:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
churches around the state after the
 
03:49:00.750 --> 03:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
passage of the CRT law we became the
 
03:49:02.830 --> 03:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
primary organization in the state
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
helping parents report violations of the
 
03:49:07.630 --> 03:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
law unfortunately although we helped
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
report at least 67 Educators who were
 
03:49:12.910 --> 03:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
credibly violating the law the
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education did not invest
 
03:49:17.229 --> 03:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
tigate any of those teachers although
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0595 does not hurt our law and
 
03:49:23.070 --> 03:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
we will not oppose the amendment neither
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
should this committee think that it will
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
get the law up and running again in the
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
district judge's ruling and joining our
 
03:49:32.229 --> 03:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
law the judge's main argument taking up
 
03:49:34.189 --> 03:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
most of his opinion was that the
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
substance of our law was ambiguous in
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
particular the judge said it was not
 
03:49:40.269 --> 03:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
clear whether the law prohibited
 
03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
teachers from promoting affirmative
 
03:49:45.070 --> 03:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
action while we think that the judge's
 
03:49:47.710 --> 03:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
decision was politically motivated he
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
did leave us a clear path to get the law
 
03:49:52.990 --> 03:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
up and running again by directly
 
03:49:55.710 --> 03:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
addressing this supposed
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
ambiguity it is true that the judge also
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
said that the law needed a clear mental
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
require mental state requirement and
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses that however
 
03:50:08.950 --> 03:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
that was only one very minor part of the
 
03:50:11.349 --> 03:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
judge's opinion there is no legal
 
03:50:13.469 --> 03:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
argument that this small change will be
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
enough to restore the law we understand
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Justice is asking
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislators not to significantly amend
 
03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
the current law but it is no secret that
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
our doj is full of attorneys who
 
03:50:27.990 --> 03:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
politically opposed passing this law in
 
03:50:31.149 --> 03:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
the first place and it was the doj that
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
consistently pressured the Department of
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
Education not to even investigate any
 
03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
violations of the law rendering the law
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
ineffective before it was even
 
03:50:44.750 --> 03:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
enjoined if the committee wants to to
 
03:50:47.910 --> 03:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
restore the CRT law as we do I hope it
 
03:50:50.189 --> 03:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
will seek a second out opinion outside
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
of our state agencies while I want to
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
offer the services of our own staff
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
litigator in crafting an amendment so
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
far our experience has been that every
 
03:51:01.550 --> 03:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
attorney outside the doj agrees that
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
simply changing the mental state element
 
03:51:06.429 --> 03:51:06.439 align:start position:0%
in this law will not address judge
 
03:51:09.389 --> 03:51:09.399 align:start position:0%
barbadoro opinion thank you and although
 
03:51:11.469 --> 03:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not an attorney I will do my best to
 
03:51:14.189 --> 03:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
answer questions I do just want quickly
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
chairman to point out when somebody was
 
03:51:18.269 --> 03:51:18.279 align:start position:0%
talking about um previously this
 
03:51:21.149 --> 03:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
question of intentionally or knowing you
 
03:51:23.349 --> 03:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
know where their mental state was we do
 
03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
that all the time in law it's not a
 
03:51:28.149 --> 03:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
unique thing thank you chairman thank
 
03:51:31.070 --> 03:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
wock thank you madam chair good
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon um I just have
 
03:51:37.349 --> 03:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
a question you said your testimony I
 
03:51:39.149 --> 03:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
think I get this right okay um that the
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
doj pressured the Department of
 
03:51:43.950 --> 03:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
Education not to prosecute this law
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
that's correct can you give me an
 
03:51:48.750 --> 03:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
example of that in convers I mean in
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
multiple conversations that we've had
 
03:51:52.030 --> 03:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
with people in the doj that that was a
 
03:51:53.830 --> 03:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
situation it's not it's not there's
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
nothing public that I can provide you
 
03:51:57.910 --> 03:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
now so there's
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
nothing May chair yes follow thank you
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing that you actually
 
03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
have to substantiate that the doj
 
03:52:07.630 --> 03:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
pressured the Department of Education
 
03:52:09.189 --> 03:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
not to fall through in their obligation
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
I'll have my attorney follow up with you
 
03:52:12.429 --> 03:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
and he can share that
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
information thank you thank you m
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
03:52:19.630 --> 03:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
dry thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:52:22.189 --> 03:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
question um I just want to get this
 
03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
right it says you oppose the bill but
 
03:52:24.319 --> 03:52:25.229 align:start position:0%
right it says you oppose the bill but
the

03:52:25.229 --> 03:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:27.870 --> 03:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is we just want to be clear
 
03:52:29.389 --> 03:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to resolve the
 
03:52:31.389 --> 03:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
concern that we have with the Department
 
03:52:33.389 --> 03:52:33.399 align:start position:0%
of Education not being able to enforce
 
03:52:35.469 --> 03:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
it okay follow so the when it says
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
oppose opposes the bill I want to get
 
03:52:39.550 --> 03:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
this right correct oppose the under we
 
03:52:42.030 --> 03:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone opposes the underlying bill
 
03:52:44.590 --> 03:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
and we would support very much a non
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
main Amendment but we believe that it
 
03:52:48.389 --> 03:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be that this language needs to
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
be tweaked in order to address the
 
03:52:51.389 --> 03:52:51.399 align:start position:0%
problem thank you for clearing that up
 
03:52:53.670 --> 03:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other questions
 
03:52:55.349 --> 03:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
oh representative Corell sorry okay
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you m that was my question I
 
03:52:58.189 --> 03:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell from your testimony
 
03:53:00.670 --> 03:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
whether you opposed or supported the
 
03:53:03.189 --> 03:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill Amendment oh okay yeah
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
the that as it what we said what I said
 
03:53:07.710 --> 03:53:07.720 align:start position:0%
in that was that we don't oppose the
 
03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
amendment as it is but we want to be
 
03:53:11.149 --> 03:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
clear that it's not going to truly
 
03:53:13.030 --> 03:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
address the issue that it's trying to
 
03:53:14.750 --> 03:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
address but it's not going to hurt like
 
03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
I said in my testimony either thank you
 
03:53:20.189 --> 03:53:20.199 align:start position:0%

printer

03:53:42.510 --> 03:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and thank you
 
03:53:54.870 --> 03:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee my name is Sam Garland
 
03:53:56.349 --> 03:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior Assistant Attorney General
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Justice um I
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
oversee the civil litigation unit and
 
03:54:01.229 --> 03:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
have been involved in the litigation
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
around the underlying law um I'm neither
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
here in support or or opposed to the
 
03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
non-main amendment or the underlying um
 
03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill but I'm here to try to provide
 
03:54:10.510 --> 03:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
technical guidance to the committee and
 
03:54:12.750 --> 03:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have and I
 
03:54:14.510 --> 03:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
think one thing that that may be helpful
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
um that I intended to talk about was
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
just kind of the course of the
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
litigation to date and where the case
 
03:54:20.309 --> 03:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
currently stands so I was planning to
 
03:54:23.229 --> 03:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
start there um and so as representative
 
03:54:24.670 --> 03:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli pointed out there was a
 
03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
challenge to the underlying um law that
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
was passed back in 2021 in Federal
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
District Court um we litigated across
 
03:54:32.750 --> 03:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
several years um and there were First
 
03:54:34.830 --> 03:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment challenges and 14th Amendment
 
03:54:36.790 --> 03:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
bigness challenges a due process clause
 
03:54:39.229 --> 03:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
a challenge to the law um that that were
 
03:54:40.830 --> 03:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
litigated both kind of at a motion to
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
dismiss stage and then after discovery
 
03:54:44.670 --> 03:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
and a motion for summary judgment um the
 
03:54:46.630 --> 03:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
district judge ruled um that at least
 
03:54:48.429 --> 03:54:48.439 align:start position:0%
with respect to curricular speech so the
 
03:54:50.429 --> 03:54:50.439 align:start position:0%
speech that uh teachers make within the
 
03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
classroom that wasn't protected by the
 
03:54:53.710 --> 03:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
First Amendment he left open whether the
 
03:54:56.269 --> 03:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
bill reached um non-curricular speech
 
03:54:57.510 --> 03:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
that would be protected by the First
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment um but then he did ultimately
 
03:55:01.590 --> 03:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
rule that the law was unconstitutionally
 
03:55:03.550 --> 03:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
vague in violation of the 14th Amendment
 
03:55:06.110 --> 03:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
so there's the there's um a long history
 
03:55:08.189 --> 03:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
of case law that if a law is to in
 
03:55:10.309 --> 03:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
determinate for people to understand
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
what it what it precludes or what it
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
prohibits um or would allow for um
 
03:55:15.910 --> 03:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
arbitrary enforcement it can violate the
 
03:55:17.670 --> 03:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment so that was the basis of
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
his ruling um he identified really three
 
03:55:21.630 --> 03:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
different things that contributed to it
 
03:55:23.110 --> 03:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to say they're unrelated
 
03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
but three different factors that he um
 
03:55:27.269 --> 03:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
believed were were what contributed to
 
03:55:30.149 --> 03:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
the bigness um one was um as
 
03:55:31.469 --> 03:55:31.479 align:start position:0%
representative Murray pointed out and
 
03:55:33.790 --> 03:55:33.800 align:start position:0%
this was a big focus of the opinion
 
03:55:35.309 --> 03:55:35.319 align:start position:0%
really that the conduct that was being
 
03:55:36.990 --> 03:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited uh he expressed concerns in
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
his opinion about those four categories
 
03:55:41.550 --> 03:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
and whether they were sufficiently clear
 
03:55:43.269 --> 03:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
um to put a person on notice as to what
 
03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
was being prohibited but then he also
 
03:55:46.990 --> 03:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
said um that there were two other
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
factors of the law that required that it
 
03:55:51.149 --> 03:55:51.159 align:start position:0%
be more precise than than than ordinary
 
03:55:53.149 --> 03:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
legislation that' be subject to what he
 
03:55:54.630 --> 03:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
called a more exacting vagueness
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
standard and those two things were the
 
03:55:57.950 --> 03:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
fact that there was a penalty the
 
03:56:01.269 --> 03:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
educator code of conduct um uh violation
 
03:56:03.389 --> 03:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
um Can can have lure ramifications and
 
03:56:05.309 --> 03:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
so there's case law um that he noted
 
03:56:06.750 --> 03:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
that supports the idea that if there's a
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
penalty associated with a law it can be
 
03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
it needs to be more precise um and then
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
also that there was no men's Rea or
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
Center requirement and that's that's
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
what this um this amendment as I
 
03:56:18.670 --> 03:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
understand it's designed to address that
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
when a law doesn't have a specific
 
03:56:22.389 --> 03:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
mental state that's required to violate
 
03:56:25.389 --> 03:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
it um it it is more susceptible to
 
03:56:26.670 --> 03:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
arbitrary enforcement it's more
 
03:56:28.590 --> 03:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
susceptible to to not putting a p person
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
on notices to how they violate the law
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
so this particular Amendment addresses
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
that concern that concern that that um
 
03:56:37.469 --> 03:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
the judge said contributed to applying a
 
03:56:39.389 --> 03:56:39.399 align:start position:0%
more heightened uh vagueness standard by
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
putting in knowing and intent or
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
intentional which are common um men's
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
Ray States common uh enter states that
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
exist in criminal law and in in civil
 
03:56:49.990 --> 03:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
laws so as I understand it this would
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
address one of the concerns it it isn't
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
clear whether that would ultimately
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
change the outcome of the litigation um
 
03:56:58.269 --> 03:56:58.279 align:start position:0%
that that's you know it's impossible and
 
03:56:59.830 --> 03:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
I know this is a lawyer lawyerly
 
03:57:01.550 --> 03:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
response but I I mean it genuinely I I
 
03:57:03.550 --> 03:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if if this bill passed
 
03:57:04.830 --> 03:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
whether it would ultimately change the
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
outcome of the litigation but it does
 
03:57:09.269 --> 03:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
directly address one of the the big
 
03:57:12.550 --> 03:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that the judge noted in the law
 
03:57:14.950 --> 03:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the uh the process the
 
03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
case is currently on appeal at the US
 
03:57:18.149 --> 03:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
court of appeals for the first circuit
 
03:57:19.830 --> 03:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
in Boston which is our appell at court
 
03:57:21.950 --> 03:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
for um Northeastern states um the
 
03:57:24.189 --> 03:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
intermediate appell at court it's mostly
 
03:57:25.590 --> 03:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
briefed and there's an oral argument
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
scheduled in Boston for um for April 8th
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
that we'll be we'll be arguing at that
 
03:57:32.269 --> 03:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
point um I don't know how long it will
 
03:57:33.630 --> 03:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
take after that for the first circuit
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
the rule it can be a matter of of weeks
 
03:57:37.710 --> 03:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
or months it can be the better part of a
 
03:57:38.830 --> 03:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
year it's an appell at court and we
 
03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
don't have a huge amount of control over
 
03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
that um at which point you know however
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
the court rules um will have more
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
guidance from a court on whether you
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
know this panel of three judges as
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to a single judge believes that
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
the law is unconstitutional if the court
 
03:57:53.590 --> 03:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
believes that it is then you know our
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
office SW to assess options and and the
 
03:57:57.469 --> 03:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
next step is the US Supreme Court from
 
03:57:59.670 --> 03:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
there um so all that all of that's to
 
03:58:01.269 --> 03:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
say the litigation is ongoing we have
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
def defended the underlying bill um and
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
again I'm not here to support oppose
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
anything as a matter of policy but we I
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
we we've defended it and we defended it
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
vigorously in this recort we are
 
03:58:13.110 --> 03:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
briefing and defending it in um in the
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
first circuit and this bill this
 
03:58:16.030 --> 03:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
amendment would address one of the
 
03:58:17.149 --> 03:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that the federal judge
 
03:58:19.630 --> 03:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
identified in the underlying law um and
 
03:58:21.830 --> 03:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
I welcome any questions that folks have
 
03:58:25.349 --> 03:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so you the state is prepared
 
03:58:27.309 --> 03:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
to fight this in the Supreme Court if it
 
03:58:29.309 --> 03:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't Prevail in first I can't
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
commit to that here I mean that's a
 
03:58:32.670 --> 03:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
question that's that's outside of my
 
03:58:34.389 --> 03:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
authority to answer it ultimately any
 
03:58:36.630 --> 03:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
sort of appeal has to go through um our
 
03:58:38.229 --> 03:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
solicitor general and ultimately through
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and so that's not
 
03:58:41.389 --> 03:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
something that sitting as you know as a
 
03:58:43.510 --> 03:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
as as litigation chap I can answer but
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's certainly something anytime we get
 
03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
an adverse ruling in court our office
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
assesses whether that's in a civil case
 
03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
like like I'm involved in a criminal
 
03:58:52.269 --> 03:58:52.279 align:start position:0%
case as well so I I can't commit one way
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
or the other to that I know it's a
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
frustrating answer but that would be the
 
03:58:58.149 --> 03:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
next step from the first circuit okay
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative Terry yes thank
 
03:59:03.149 --> 03:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
you uh sir the previous witness
 
03:59:08.030 --> 03:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that there were 67 cases or
 
03:59:11.710 --> 03:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
complaints that were filed by
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
individuals with respect to the claim a
 
03:59:16.590 --> 03:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
violation of the
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
law um are you in a position to be able
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
to given your position to be able to
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
tell us whether in fact you can confirm
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
that any number between 1 and 67 cases
 
03:59:32.550 --> 03:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
which the previous witness has indicated
 
03:59:34.590 --> 03:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
that she will supply the committee
 
03:59:39.389 --> 03:59:39.399 align:start position:0%
details with um any number between 1 and
 
03:59:42.149 --> 03:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
67 given that you have said that you
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
will be vigorously supporting the law in
 
03:59:47.950 --> 03:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
court that seems to run counter to the
 
03:59:51.790 --> 03:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
claim that between 1 and 67 complaints
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
that were made or up to 67 complaints
 
03:59:57.910 --> 03:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
that were made were not acted upon by
 
03:59:59.590 --> 03:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice with respect
 
04:00:01.710 --> 04:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
to its relationship to the Department of
 
04:00:05.070 --> 04:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
Education is is is is that so in in your
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge or is does this come
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
as a a Mis a shock to you today I think
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
I understand your question there are a
 
04:00:12.550 --> 04:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
couple different parts to it so if
 
04:00:14.229 --> 04:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me I'll try I'll try to
 
04:00:16.429 --> 04:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
and and if it if if that in fact has any
 
04:00:19.229 --> 04:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
basis in in truth what would be the
 
04:00:22.590 --> 04:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
reason to not act upon the complaints
 
04:00:25.149 --> 04:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
that were filed in a positive manner so
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
the first the answer the first part of
 
04:00:28.510 --> 04:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
your question the Department of Justice
 
04:00:30.070 --> 04:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
didn't doesn't play a specific role
 
04:00:31.830 --> 04:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
under the statute and in enforcing the
 
04:00:33.990 --> 04:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
law the the underlying statute has two
 
04:00:35.590 --> 04:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms one is an
 
04:00:37.990 --> 04:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
educator Board of conduct um proceeding
 
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
before the Board of Education that the
 
04:00:40.990 --> 04:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education brings and the
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
other is an action either in Superior
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
Court or the Human Rights Commission
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
for um for violation of the
 
04:00:47.910 --> 04:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws and our office
 
04:00:50.110 --> 04:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
and this is in our briefing um took the
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
position that that and this this happens
 
04:00:52.830 --> 04:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
quite commonly when there are two
 
04:00:55.269 --> 04:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
different um state agencies uh that that
 
04:00:57.030 --> 04:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
have enforcement Authority that the
 
04:00:58.750 --> 04:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
process needed to go through the uh
 
04:01:00.510 --> 04:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission first and
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately to find a violation of law
 
04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
before the uh abort of Education
 
04:01:07.030 --> 04:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding could could start and that
 
04:01:09.790 --> 04:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
that's just a a structure of of the law
 
04:01:11.429 --> 04:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
position that we took and it's it's one
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
that I think is um is a fair reading of
 
04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
the underlying law and we represented
 
04:01:17.229 --> 04:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
that in court in terms of the numbers I
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
I really don't know sitting here today
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I I I I'm not aware of any specific
 
04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
number of of matters that was filed in
 
04:01:26.910 --> 04:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
the board or in the Human Rights
 
04:01:27.990 --> 04:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
Commission though I know there there
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
were some and I don't know how many that
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
was and because the Human Rights
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
Commission process was kind of the first
 
04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
step in the process I I I don't believe
 
04:01:37.950 --> 04:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
that there were any formal Board of
 
04:01:40.149 --> 04:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
Education matters file but that was
 
04:01:41.590 --> 04:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
because of the guidance that we provided
 
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of kind of how the process went
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
to the HRC or to the Superior Court
 
04:01:46.590 --> 04:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
first and then ultimately went to the
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
Board of Education um I'm happy to to
 
04:01:50.189 --> 04:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
provide follow-up information sitting
 
04:01:52.110 --> 04:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
here today I can't confirm or deny you
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
know 67 or whatever the number would be
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
but I did I hopefully that's helpful in
 
04:01:56.990 --> 04:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
explaining the
 
04:01:59.910 --> 04:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
process so just be clear to the best of
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
your knowledge you have not been
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
involved in any of these alleged cases
 
04:02:07.469 --> 04:02:07.479 align:start position:0%
or complaints that have been brought by
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh the previous witness indicated 67
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
individuals that that because of the
 
04:02:14.189 --> 04:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
process that you've outlined and and how
 
04:02:16.030 --> 04:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
this how these sorts of things are are
 
04:02:18.229 --> 04:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
addressed and handled you you have not
 
04:02:20.349 --> 04:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
even had the opportunity or been given
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity or been requested to be
 
04:02:24.870 --> 04:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
involved at this point so we the
 
04:02:26.670 --> 04:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice is not involved in
 
04:02:28.030 --> 04:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
formally enforcing the law so the
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice doesn't bring um a
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
case in the Board of Education I guess
 
04:02:33.630 --> 04:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
is is the more direct answer to that
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
question um in terms of what we have
 
04:02:38.309 --> 04:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
counseled um uh state agencies in terms
 
04:02:40.269 --> 04:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
of the process I mean we've provided in
 
04:02:41.830 --> 04:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
our in our written filings kind of the
 
04:02:43.950 --> 04:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
the two-step process that that I just
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
explained um I wouldn't be comfortable
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
going into any kind of anything else
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
that we've advised agencies just as our
 
04:02:53.349 --> 04:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
Council representative Hall mad chair
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
kind of a followup to that those
 
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
questions um we heard from the previous
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
speaker that the doj pressured the doe I
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
mean those are the that you pressured
 
04:03:08.750 --> 04:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed can you speak to
 
04:03:14.110 --> 04:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
that uh I don't want to put words in um
 
04:03:15.630 --> 04:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
I I I believe that that the answer to
 
04:03:20.149 --> 04:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
that question is is how I just answered
 
04:03:21.910 --> 04:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
the last question which is we did take
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
the position of how that the process
 
04:03:25.750 --> 04:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
plays out that it's HRC before it goes
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
to the um Board of Education because um
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
and there are credential reasons for
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
that you don't want two different boards
 
04:03:33.269 --> 04:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the same underlying conduct
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
simultaneously diverting resources and
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
coming potentially to to opposite
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
conclusions that that so so the guidance
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we provided was that there was that
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
it went to the HRC first under um and
 
04:03:44.910 --> 04:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
then it UL imately went to the Board of
 
04:03:48.429 --> 04:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
Education um I I I can't speak to any
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
specific conversations and and I don't I
 
04:03:52.349 --> 04:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
don't know that I would characterize
 
04:03:53.710 --> 04:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
that as pressure but I can tell you that
 
04:03:56.149 --> 04:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
that is that is the formal um position
 
04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
we took about how the law was to be
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
enforced thank you any other
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative Morris thank
 
04:04:05.469 --> 04:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
you for my question I just had one
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
clarification piece you mentioned
 
04:04:09.309 --> 04:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
earlier about the first amendment being
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
exempt from classrooms could you just
 
04:04:12.670 --> 04:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
kind of clarify on that a little bit
 
04:04:14.349 --> 04:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
sure I can speak to my understanding of
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
how the judge ruled on that so there was
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
a question about um the the First
 
04:04:20.309 --> 04:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment challenge was uh along the
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
lines of of teachers being forced to
 
04:04:24.429 --> 04:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
speak in particular ways or or not
 
04:04:26.790 --> 04:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
forced to speak in particular ways um
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
that would violate their their own First
 
04:04:29.910 --> 04:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights and there's case law
 
04:04:31.870 --> 04:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not unique to New Hampshire
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
that um when teachers are making
 
04:04:35.590 --> 04:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
pedagogical speech or curricular speech
 
04:04:37.070 --> 04:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
classroom speech that that's not
 
04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
protected by the First Amendment there
 
04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:40.439 align:start position:0%
there's US Supreme Court case law that
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of touches on the overarching
 
04:04:43.710 --> 04:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
issue of official speech versus private
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
speech and then there's kind of the
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
downflow of that to the classroom and so
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
um at the earlier stage of the case in
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
the motion to dismiss um the the
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
district judge ruled that and then with
 
04:04:54.750 --> 04:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
respect to this law that that was true
 
04:04:55.870 --> 04:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
as well that to the extent it was
 
04:04:57.710 --> 04:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
affecting curricular speech classroom
 
04:04:59.070 --> 04:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
speech it didn't implicate the first
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that didn't resolve um a
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
question that ultimately wasn't resolved
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
because the district judge took the view
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
it didn't need to be which is to the
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
extent this law reaches extracurricular
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
speech whether that is subject to some
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
protection and whether it would
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately create a First Amendment
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
problem there um you know the plaintiffs
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
made that argument we addressed it in
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
briefing but because the judge viewed
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
the law as unconstitutionally vague um
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
It ultimately kind of rendered moot that
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
question so but my answer but to
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
specifically answer your question it was
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
um around the first amendment
 
04:05:30.189 --> 04:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
protections afforded to curricular
 
04:05:31.990 --> 04:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
speech any other questions
 
04:05:34.830 --> 04:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you um you
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
said that this amendment would address
 
04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
the third Point's specific mental state
 
04:05:42.910 --> 04:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
of so that would say any person claiming
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that any person could be my
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
neighbor's Uncle claiming to be AG
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
grieved by an intentional or knowing
 
04:05:50.590 --> 04:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
violation how do you how do you know
 
04:05:53.389 --> 04:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
something is intentional or knowing I'm
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
somebody could do something and then
 
04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
when they asked about that that's not
 
04:06:00.149 --> 04:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
how I meant to it to come across so how
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
how do you determine that it was
 
04:06:04.510 --> 04:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
intentional or knowing I I think you
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
would uh be better served having a
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
criminal attorney here because those
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's the um venue where that more
 
04:06:14.349 --> 04:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
often comes up um but um ult timately it
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
is it is a question of whether through
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
direct evidence or circumstantial
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
evidence you can prove kind of the legal
 
04:06:21.309 --> 04:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
standards for for intent or the legal
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
standard for knowing there has been a
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
fair amount of litigation um around
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
whether those standards themselves are
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
vague and and that came up in the
 
04:06:30.429 --> 04:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
context of this and what our US Supreme
 
04:06:32.429 --> 04:06:32.439 align:start position:0%
Court has said is that um you know it
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
isn't it doesn't necessarily resolve the
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
question in any particular case whether
 
04:06:39.309 --> 04:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
um whether there is a constitutional
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
issue with respect to an application of
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
a statute but when you have those kind
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
of well-worn Concepts in a law generally
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
speaking it can it can help protect it
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
against um a a facial challenge a
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
challenge that the law is completely
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um in all of its
 
04:06:54.070 --> 04:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
applications which is how the judge
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
ruled in this case um I I'm guessing
 
04:06:57.469 --> 04:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
that's not a satisfying answer but but
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
but the short answer is knowing an
 
04:07:00.429 --> 04:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
intentional conduct or knowing or
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
intentional conduct is commonly
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
something that a Prosecuting entity has
 
04:07:06.309 --> 04:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
to prove it can be hard to prove you
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
need to prove it through um director
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
circumstantial evidence that would
 
04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
persuade by the standard of proof that
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
applies that that it's overcome um but
 
04:07:14.990 --> 04:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
courts have recognized that because
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
those concepts are kind of inherent in
 
04:07:18.110 --> 04:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
our Judicial System they and of
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
themselves don't create a bigness
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
problem representative
 
04:07:26.109 --> 04:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you madam chair thank you

for helping us with

this is it correct or not that part of

and perhaps
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%

04:07:58.269 --> 04:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
statute like us going into court and
 
04:08:00.790 --> 04:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
defending it or in terms of when to
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
bring an action under a statute because
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
because my rule is to defend has been to
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
defend our unit to defend a statute to
 
04:08:08.590 --> 04:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
when it is challenged on constitutional
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
grounds we aren't the entity that that
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
would prosecute an action under the
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
statute if you were going to seek an
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
educator code of conduct violation or or
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
or something of that kind I
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
continue so yes in light of what you
 
04:08:22.920 --> 04:08:24.189 align:start position:0%
continue so yes in light of what you
just

04:08:24.189 --> 04:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
informed could you just walk us through
 
04:08:28.109 --> 04:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit more how that would work so
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
that whether it's this statute or I'm
 
04:08:31.710 --> 04:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
just trying to pull back and get sort of
 
04:08:33.550 --> 04:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
a broader
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
picture generally how doj would interact
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
with other
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
agencies by way of trying to further
 
04:08:44.030 --> 04:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
clarify what may or may not have been
 
04:08:46.590 --> 04:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
pressure from doj to doe uh understood
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I the the thing I can't speak to
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
and and this was an answer in response
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
to your question to representative Terry
 
04:08:54.510 --> 04:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
is is any sort of attorney client
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
Communications because the agencies um
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
and at times the legislature and at
 
04:08:58.990 --> 04:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
times the you know the governor's office
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
are are clients when their um our legal
 
04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
advice can come up and so I I can't
 
04:09:05.309 --> 04:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
speak to that and and and but what I can
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
say generally speaking is that um
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
agencies come to our office all the time
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
um asking for for um guidance on on
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
legal questions
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a client counseling unit
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the counterpart unit to the
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
one I oversee within the Civil Bureau
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
that provides legal advice to um two
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
agencies and that's true of every agency
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
in the state um in the governor's office
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
and there have been times when you know
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and the legislature
 
04:09:31.710 --> 04:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
um require uh legal guidance to or legal
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
representation than the Civil Bureau
 
04:09:35.429 --> 04:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
does that so um it it's it can be across
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
government any other
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for coming
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:45.760 --> 04:09:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
Diana

04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:03.149 --> 04:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
Fenton good afternoon for the record uh
 
04:10:04.990 --> 04:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Diana Fenton I'm an attorney
 
04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education um I'm
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
here to answer questions and I don't
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
really have a whole lot to offer but we
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
were being mentioned quite a bit so I
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
certainly wanted to make myself
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
available here um you know our
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
understanding the Department's
 
04:10:25.070 --> 04:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
understanding of the law um and if you
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
look at RSA 193 colon 40 it starts on
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
page 561 and it goes on to page
 
04:10:36.189 --> 04:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
562 but I'll Focus your attention on
 
04:10:36.199 --> 04:10:37.910 align:start position:0%
562 but I'll Focus your attention on
page

04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
562 Roman numeral
 
04:10:45.309 --> 04:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
3 and without violating any attorney
 
04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
client privilege with the Department of
 
04:10:48.269 --> 04:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
Justice which I know right now they're
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
looking behind me going oh please don't
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
and I promise Sam I won't but if you
 
04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
look on the doj
 
04:10:56.670 --> 04:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
website they issued a we call them
 
04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
technical advisories what do you what do
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
you call them it was either an attorney
 
04:11:02.349 --> 04:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
general opinion or frequently asked
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
questions there you go a really
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
important document let's call it that
 
04:11:07.710 --> 04:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
shall we um it's right on their website
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
and they issued guidance on the
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this law that's what
 
04:11:14.750 --> 04:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
the department of Education
 
04:11:17.229 --> 04:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
followed and I would encourage the
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
members of this committee to look on the
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
doj website look at the guidance they
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
issued that's not attorney to client
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
privilege and if it is well Sam it's
 
04:11:29.149 --> 04:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
been violated it's public so um it's
 
04:11:32.349 --> 04:11:32.359 align:start position:0%
right there on the website and I know
 
04:11:34.149 --> 04:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk and chatter
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
about what the department did or
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have done or 67 cases but the
 
04:11:44.189 --> 04:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation of RSA 183 colon 4
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
was already done Years Ago by the
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and it's
 
04:11:52.510 --> 04:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
written very clearly in Roman numeral 3
 
04:11:54.990 --> 04:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
it says any person claiming to be
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
grieved by a violation of this
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
section May initiate a civil action
 
04:12:03.070 --> 04:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
against a school or School District in
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
Superior Court that's not the Department
 
04:12:05.359 --> 04:12:06.790 align:start position:0%
Superior Court that's not the Department
of

04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:12:11.469 --> 04:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
Education for legal or Equitable relief
 
04:12:14.149 --> 04:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
or with the New Hampshire commission for
 
04:12:14.159 --> 04:12:15.990 align:start position:0%
or with the New Hampshire commission for
human

04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
human
 
04:12:19.830 --> 04:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
rights those two entities were the area
 
04:12:23.349 --> 04:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
where these cases were investigated and
 
04:12:27.630 --> 04:12:27.640 align:start position:0%
litigated and in Roman numeral 4 if
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
there was a finding a violation of the
 
04:12:32.429 --> 04:12:32.439 align:start position:0%
section if there was a finding that
 
04:12:36.189 --> 04:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
there had been a violation then and only
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
then did the jurisdiction transfer if
 
04:12:42.389 --> 04:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
you will to the Department of Education
 
04:12:46.670 --> 04:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
imposed now you know I'm no fool so I'm
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
going to turn around and check with Sam
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
make sure I got that right ready here we
 
04:12:56.269 --> 04:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
go Sam we good oh I love when he says
 
04:12:59.109 --> 04:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
that makes my
 
04:13:02.109 --> 04:13:02.119 align:start position:0%
day that was the role the Department of
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
Education played under this statute
 
04:13:08.429 --> 04:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
that's how the law is clearly written
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
and that interpretation was supported
 
04:13:13.950 --> 04:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
and enforced by the doj's I'll call it
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
advisory opinion but let's just say
 
04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
really important paper that's on their
 
04:13:20.710 --> 04:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
website and I would encourage you to
 
04:13:22.349 --> 04:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
take a look at it that's what the
 
04:13:24.429 --> 04:13:24.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education followed oh look
 
04:13:26.189 --> 04:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
at that you're already ahead of the game
 
04:13:28.030 --> 04:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
I should have known that's why she's in
 
04:13:28.040 --> 04:13:30.710 align:start position:0%
I should have known that's why she's in
charge

04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
charge
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
um that's the role the department played
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
in this I'm not aware of the 67 cases I
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
don't know where that number comes from
 
04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
I don't dispute it I don't mistrust it I
 
04:13:43.950 --> 04:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just not in a position to say
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
yes that's an accurate number or it's
 
04:13:48.189 --> 04:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
not because again I want to highlight
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
the law is clear as written it follows
 
04:13:52.109 --> 04:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
the interpretation by the Department of
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
Justice and the department of
 
04:13:57.870 --> 04:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
education's role in this was limited to
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
Simply the penalty if there was a
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
finding from any of those agent uh those
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
other entities the superior court or the
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission that being said
 
04:14:09.790 --> 04:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions and I
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time I know it's been a
 
04:14:14.109 --> 04:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
long day already any questions
 
04:14:16.510 --> 04:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative B Bon thank you madam
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
question okay again for clarification if
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
I had an issue and I thought that one of
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
these violations had happened in my
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
school where would I report
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
it you would report it you would
 
04:14:36.750 --> 04:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
initiate a civil action in Superior
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
Court or you would file with the Human
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and my understanding
 
04:14:44.229 --> 04:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
was that the department of education was
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
receiving a lot of these complaints as
 
04:14:49.070 --> 04:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's understandable as a member of the
 
04:14:50.950 --> 04:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
general public I would put the two
 
04:14:53.710 --> 04:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
together we would re-refer them to the
 
04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission and I believe
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
there was a link on our website you
 
04:14:59.469 --> 04:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
remember this there's Sam's going to
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
leave he's he's like I'm G to sneak out
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
the back door um there was a link on our
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
website that went directly to the Human
 
04:15:06.159 --> 04:15:08.429 align:start position:0%
website that went directly to the Human
Rights

04:15:08.429 --> 04:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.469 --> 04:15:11.479 align:start position:0%
Commission clarification yes so just
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
again a clarification
 
04:15:15.950 --> 04:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
um if I was reporting there was a link
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
that was on the doe site yes that nobody
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
at the doe saw it went directly to the
 
04:15:26.070 --> 04:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
doj no it did not go to directly to the
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
doj it went to the Human Rights
 
04:15:29.790 --> 04:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
Commission oh Human Rights Commission
 
04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that is my understanding
 
04:15:33.389 --> 04:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge the
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Education did not have
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
access to those there was a link on our
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
website and it went to the Human Rights
 
04:15:39.439 --> 04:15:40.670 align:start position:0%
website and it went to the Human Rights
Commission

04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:15:44.109 --> 04:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
Sam that web page is there yeah
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%

04:15:49.149 --> 04:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
you attorney Fenton for taking my
 
04:15:52.830 --> 04:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
question so after it goes to the Human
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission walk us through the
 
04:15:54.800 --> 04:15:57.030 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission walk us through the
process

04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:15:59.109 --> 04:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
please it goes through the Human Rights
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
Commission it's investigated by the
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission I have no
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
oversight no I I understand in that
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
world so I can't get into the details of
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
that okay if there is a finding if
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's a violation if someone says here
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
found that there was a violation of
 
04:16:18.030 --> 04:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
19340 then it would come to the
 
04:16:21.510 --> 04:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to review and
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
impose a sanction on the credential
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
holder license depending on the facts of
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
that case Okay follow up follow up so
 
04:16:30.670 --> 04:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
through this process from what you
 
04:16:34.109 --> 04:16:34.119 align:start position:0%
understand the doj never comes into play
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
correct are you the one of you anybody
 
04:16:40.030 --> 04:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
who can answer it I'm good I'm happy to
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
try to answer thank you for the question
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
um the doj May have a role to play I
 
04:16:45.149 --> 04:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
mean we certainly have a role to play in
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
interpreting the law and I appreciate um
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
attorney Fen pointing out the uh the our
 
04:16:51.550 --> 04:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
opinion because that is on the website
 
04:16:53.710 --> 04:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
and that is the public guidance um we do
 
04:16:55.469 --> 04:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
have a role to play when we're asked for
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
to provide legal guidance um to agencies
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to interpret the law or
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
how to implement the law and we
 
04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
certainly have a role to play and that's
 
04:17:04.030 --> 04:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
the role I play in defending laws when
 
04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
they're challenged and and we do that
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
whether we agree with the law whether we
 
04:17:08.469 --> 04:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
disagree with the law whether um you
 
04:17:11.070 --> 04:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
know it's it's susceptible to to a
 
04:17:12.670 --> 04:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
challenge or whe whether a challenge is
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
is completely meritless I mean that's
 
04:17:15.070 --> 04:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the role we play in civil
 
04:17:16.590 --> 04:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
litigation so those are really The Three
 
04:17:19.149 --> 04:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
Hats that that we might play uh in Visa
 
04:17:22.269 --> 04:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
a law like this okay thank you any other
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative wock thank you
 
04:17:26.670 --> 04:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
mam chairman good afternoon ladies
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
gentlemen attorneys
 
04:17:32.309 --> 04:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
um Mrs or Miss I don't know the
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
executive director McKinley of the
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone said in her written
 
04:17:39.550 --> 04:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
statement in her Ral statement that the
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
doj consistently pressured the
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
04:17:46.269 --> 04:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
not to even investigate any violations I
 
04:17:47.790 --> 04:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
asked her for example she didn't have
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
any are you aware of being consistently
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
pressured uh represent I mean attorney
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
Fenton of the doj not to even
 
04:17:58.830 --> 04:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
investigate no I am not thank you sir
 
04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
may I ask you the same um no I think the
 
04:18:03.630 --> 04:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
only thing that I'm aware of is is
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
providing guidance to agencies both
 
04:18:06.990 --> 04:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
public guidance like what attorney F
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned and and guidance that would
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
subject to returning client privilege
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
but not something that that I would
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
understand to be consistent pressure
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you both very much thank you Mr
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
chair if if I may I want to give a full
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
answer to representative Freeman um
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
there is uh this civil rights unit at uh
 
04:18:25.269 --> 04:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
with attorney Sean Lock um so I know
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education when
 
04:18:29.950 --> 04:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
these cases would come up we would refer
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
them to the Human Rights Commission as I
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
previously testified to but we have also
 
04:18:36.870 --> 04:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
reached out and work very closely with
 
04:18:40.189 --> 04:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
sha lock if an issue comes up um we will
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
refer it to to him for consideration he
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
might then pass it on to the Human
 
04:18:45.550 --> 04:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission so there's a lot of
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
back and forth with these state agencies
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
um and and I think to representative
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
woodcock's uh question about pressure it
 
04:18:55.950 --> 04:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
really is very collaborative um in terms
 
04:18:58.590 --> 04:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
of our our working relationship whether
 
04:19:00.309 --> 04:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's with the Human Rights Commission or
 
04:19:03.070 --> 04:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office it is I
 
04:19:05.950 --> 04:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
have found in my experience it's a very
 
04:19:09.309 --> 04:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
collaborative issue and so they produced
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
their technical sorry technical
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
advisory you call it again there there
 
04:19:16.349 --> 04:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
were two different if just to clarify
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
there were two different there was an
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general opinion and there were
 
04:19:20.109 --> 04:19:20.119 align:start position:0%
frequently asked questions that were
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
released jointly between the
 
04:19:22.080 --> 04:19:24.389 align:start position:0%
released jointly between the
agencies

04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:19:27.630 --> 04:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
so we have had an ongoing rapport with
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission as it
 
04:19:31.109 --> 04:19:31.119 align:start position:0%
pertains to these cases and the Attorney
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
General's office as it pertains to these
 
04:19:34.990 --> 04:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
cases but the guidance has always been
 
04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
very clear that the investigative part
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
of it is handled by the Human Rights
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
Commission or the Civil Rights unit of
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office maybe I
 
04:19:48.269 --> 04:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
don't know I can't speak that and then
 
04:19:50.349 --> 04:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
and then if there is a violation it
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
comes to the Department of Education so
 
04:19:55.309 --> 04:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
I hope that helps to better um better
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
answer your question I didn't want you
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
to think that we just bypass the
 
04:20:01.149 --> 04:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice because we work
 
04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
very closely with the Civil Rights unit
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
there and I I thank you attorney Fenton
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
um please don't take this the wrong way
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
but it's still as clear as mud so I
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
think you know you you you've definitely
 
04:20:16.229 --> 04:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
made it clearer but I I I do think that
 
04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
there are areas where it's still a
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
little fuzzy and a little gray not for
 
04:20:22.349 --> 04:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
me because you just sat here and
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
explained it to me but for the general
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
public who may not know how to you know
 
04:20:28.990 --> 04:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate this system so but I
 
04:20:30.910 --> 04:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you both sat
 
04:20:32.670 --> 04:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
here and just walked us through the
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
whole thing I appreciate that and and I
 
04:20:37.109 --> 04:20:37.119 align:start position:0%
will just say representative Freeman I
 
04:20:39.950 --> 04:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
have spoken with a lot of really smart
 
04:20:42.030 --> 04:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys that I hold in very high
 
04:20:45.109 --> 04:20:45.119 align:start position:0%
regard and they have said to me so what
 
04:20:48.109 --> 04:20:48.119 align:start position:0%
happens who does what I I think it was a
 
04:20:48.119 --> 04:20:48.910 align:start position:0%
happens who does what I I think it was a
very

04:20:48.910 --> 04:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:20:51.389 --> 04:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
confusing situation I can't say I found
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
the law confusing but just the the
 
04:20:57.070 --> 04:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
Dynamics that it created and so I
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
certainly will say that I appreciate the
 
04:21:00.910 --> 04:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office releasing
 
04:21:03.269 --> 04:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
their opinion or frequently asked
 
04:21:05.790 --> 04:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
questions that that did provide a lot of
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
guidance not only to the department of
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
education but also to the field as to
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
what agency is to do what role
 
04:21:16.189 --> 04:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
so that was very appreciated I do
 
04:21:18.429 --> 04:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate thank you representative
 
04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
Terry so I just want to be um clear I
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
realize we're not engaged here in a
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics or fixic session but think
 
04:21:28.750 --> 04:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
of thinking thinking of this in terms of
 
04:21:28.760 --> 04:21:29.389 align:start position:0%
of thinking thinking of this in terms of
a

04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:21:34.229 --> 04:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
flowchart if somebody were to
 
04:21:36.670 --> 04:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
mistakenly um attempt to file a
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
complaint with the doj then it's my
 
04:21:41.670 --> 04:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
understanding the doj would refer the
 
04:21:44.550 --> 04:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
person to the Department of Education
 
04:21:46.750 --> 04:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education would then
 
04:21:48.510 --> 04:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
inform the individual you have two
 
04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
courses of action you can file with the
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission or you can file
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
a case in a civil case in Superior Court
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
and that would be the correct place now
 
04:21:59.790 --> 04:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
somebody might get it right the first
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
time if they happen to know the law but
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
if they didn't know the law and they
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
either went to the doj first or they
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
went to to you at the Department of
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
Education ultimately where that person
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
would be directed would be to the
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
provisions that are laid out the
 
04:22:16.030 --> 04:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that are laid out in
 
04:22:20.189 --> 04:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
statute correct yes yes this is like
 
04:22:22.630 --> 04:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
rules for dummies so thank you oh no
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
that's the only those are the only rules
 
04:22:26.349 --> 04:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
I know are the ones for dummies but yes
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
we we found ourselves in a position
 
04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
where we
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
were routinely re-refer these matters to
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission or to the
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights unit at the Attorney
 
04:22:38.910 --> 04:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
04:22:48.750 --> 04:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:48.760 --> 04:22:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
can't

04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:22:51.630 --> 04:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
hear can't
 
04:22:53.550 --> 04:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
hear it
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
is it is on but hello there I'm back
 
04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
that what happened oh so it said on that
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph on three section three again
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
it says there's two ways to do it and
 
04:23:09.189 --> 04:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
you you've referred to it and we've
 
04:23:11.309 --> 04:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about um if it the link
 
04:23:14.229 --> 04:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
came in and then it would be sent to uh
 
04:23:15.750 --> 04:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire commission for human
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
rights but the other way uh would would
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
that does that mean that the um the
 
04:23:24.510 --> 04:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
parents or the aggrieved individual
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
would would file a civil action
 
04:23:30.030 --> 04:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
independently against the school and the
 
04:23:32.269 --> 04:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
school the state would not be involved
 
04:23:38.590 --> 04:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
way um I think you're talking about
 
04:23:44.109 --> 04:23:44.119 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 correct um so yes so
 
04:23:45.550 --> 04:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
there there were really two options for
 
04:23:47.550 --> 04:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement there and um and I just want
 
04:23:49.109 --> 04:23:49.119 align:start position:0%
to clarify an answer I provided earlier
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
which was respect with respect to the
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
board of education for for a direct
 
04:23:54.269 --> 04:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
action either in the Human Rights
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
Commission or um Superior Court it was
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
any person who who claimed to be
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by the law or or the Attorney
 
04:24:01.469 --> 04:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
General's office could do that in the
 
04:24:02.790 --> 04:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
same way that the Civil Rights unit
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
enforces laws under um under uh
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
354a but so so yes any person could go
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
into into court and do it in that way um
 
04:24:13.269 --> 04:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
it's the board of education process that
 
04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
then comes after that as attorney Fenton
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
was talking about that that once there's
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
been a found violation then a board of
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
education action can go forward before
 
04:24:20.040 --> 04:24:25.469 align:start position:0%
education action can go forward before
the

04:24:25.469 --> 04:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:25.479 --> 04:24:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
board

04:24:27.030 --> 04:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:24:30.670 --> 04:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
hello so do you know if um we talked a
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
lot about you know that that nothing
 
04:24:33.790 --> 04:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
really happened the other way there
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
weren't any violations or any cases
 
04:24:38.750 --> 04:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
filed but the first way if they went to
 
04:24:41.309 --> 04:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
Superior Court do you know of any
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
instances or attempts of of of not
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
attempts um filings that went through
 
04:24:48.600 --> 04:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
attempts um filings that went through
Superior

04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.229 --> 04:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
Court agreed by the law um ultimately uh
 
04:25:10.870 --> 04:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
the the federal judge declared the law
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so at this point it's
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
not enforceable light that order so none
 
04:25:18.109 --> 04:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
of those timately came to any fruition
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if there was B prop cause
 
04:25:26.790 --> 04:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you madam chair and
 
04:25:34.750 --> 04:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question so if
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding correctly the judge
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
ruled that there are three areas of
 
04:25:41.710 --> 04:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
vagueness the this amendment covers the
 
04:25:44.349 --> 04:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
addresses the third issue but the first
 
04:25:46.750 --> 04:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
issue um conduct that is being
 
04:25:48.910 --> 04:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited and then the second penalty
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be more
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
precise do you have suggestions on what
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
we can do to approve improve this
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
amendment or I realize that we may be
 
04:25:58.990 --> 04:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
catching you on the spot is this
 
04:25:59.000 --> 04:25:59.910 align:start position:0%
catching you on the spot is this
something

04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:26:03.630 --> 04:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
that oh is it not a question I I I don't
 
04:26:04.750 --> 04:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
believe that they can give us
 
04:26:08.269 --> 04:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
suggestions on how to change oh sorry
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.670 --> 04:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
although we would like you to do our
 
04:26:15.830 --> 04:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
work for
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
us any other questions IDE yeah seeing n
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:39.630 --> 04:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:43.030 --> 04:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
coren good afternoon uh my name is Lori
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
coren I'm a state rep in uh Coos 7 but I
 
04:26:50.189 --> 04:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
want to testify today just for myself
 
04:26:53.469 --> 04:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
not for my constituents um there was a
 
04:26:55.469 --> 04:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
time four years ago I was contacted by
 
04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
one of the parents up in the north
 
04:26:59.309 --> 04:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
country and one of the teachers at the
 
04:27:01.550 --> 04:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
local high school was um she's a
 
04:27:02.750 --> 04:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
language arts
 
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
teacher and she was they were reading a
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
book and the book included um Christian
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
missionaries go in and
 
04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
go into a tribe or something and
 
04:27:19.389 --> 04:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
whatever happened anyway um she wrote on
 
04:27:22.830 --> 04:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
the board um Bible thumping
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
crackers to refer to the Christian
 
04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
missionaries she then continued to refer
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
to the Bible thumping crackers or B T
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
C's um as that word now this parent
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
actually gave me pictures of her writing
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
this on the board uh she also had a
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
video of the teacher referring to the
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
Christian missionaries
 
04:27:50.429 --> 04:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
as the b
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
word this parent came to me asking for
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
help I had no idea what to do I did end
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
up sending letters to each of the school
 
04:28:00.910 --> 04:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
board members to the principal to the
 
04:28:04.590 --> 04:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
assistant principal um and I was
 
04:28:08.510 --> 04:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
stonewalled the entire time um one of
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
the superintendant actually said she
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
would get back to me she did didn't um I
 
04:28:16.750 --> 04:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
wrote back probably about 4 days later
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
um and I said you know this the the
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
parent who sent me this her child isn't
 
04:28:23.950 --> 04:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable in class anymore they they
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
were a Christian family um
 
04:28:31.510 --> 04:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
and they refused to help I kept asking
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
you know what where can I send a letter
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
plus the pictures plus the videos um I
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
think I think things like this um um are
 
04:28:47.109 --> 04:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
necessary um I would love to say all
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
teachers are there just to

afternoon uh for the record my name is
 
04:37:07.709 --> 04:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
representative Christine Perez um
 
04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 16 representing the town of
 
04:37:12.590 --> 04:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
London daring
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
last time I'm before you this year um
 
04:37:19.629 --> 04:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple bill um and I have
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
submitted an amendment to you the
 
04:37:25.150 --> 04:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
amendment only changes um words from
 
04:37:29.709 --> 04:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
school to sto school districts and from
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
um a legislative body to the
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
municipality of a of a school so
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
basically um this is to require the
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
school districts to form a policy to
 
04:37:46.750 --> 04:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy um concerning the
 
04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
acceptance of Grants or seeking grants
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
for medical products or services or
 
04:37:55.949 --> 04:37:55.959 align:start position:0%
funds um that unless the town votes in
 
04:37:58.590 --> 04:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
favor of it once again this clarifies
 
04:38:01.869 --> 04:38:01.879 align:start position:0%
guidelines for in School Employees and
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
make sure that families are aware of any
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
such uh procurements that are being um
 
04:38:10.590 --> 04:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
in that are in the schools and you can
 
04:38:13.150 --> 04:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
ask why um well there's several reasons
 
04:38:16.429 --> 04:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
why um parents in the community should
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
be aware of such services and have the
 
04:38:22.429 --> 04:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
option to approve or not approve it and
 
04:38:25.869 --> 04:38:25.879 align:start position:0%
schools are typically not in the
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
business and should not be in the
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
business of Health Care um in
 
04:38:33.470 --> 04:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances for their own protection
 
04:38:36.029 --> 04:38:36.039 align:start position:0%
um the only health care provider that
 
04:38:37.629 --> 04:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
you really have in a school would be
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
your would be your school nurse um
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
grants usually have an end date on them
 
04:38:50.551 --> 04:38:50.561 align:start position:0%
at which time um the money needed for
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
the continuing the service or the
 
04:38:57.510 --> 04:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
um procurement of such things would fall
 
04:39:01.390 --> 04:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
onto the taxpayer so therefore um they
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
should be aware of a grant um I can
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
equate this to it when you ask for a
 
04:39:09.910 --> 04:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
three-year Grant to bring on perhaps a
 
04:39:14.230 --> 04:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
new um safety a police officer once that
 
04:39:17.709 --> 04:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
three-year Grant is done then the um
 
04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
salary and for that falls on so people
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
should be aware of um any type of grant
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
for that reason I really have nothing
 
04:39:29.310 --> 04:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
else to say about it it's fairly simple
 
04:39:32.830 --> 04:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm more than willing to take any
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Morris thank
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
04:39:39.150 --> 04:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
my only question here is regards to
 
04:39:43.390 --> 04:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
First Aid um aeds and uh like epipens
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
and we passed a bill recently about
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
epinephrine injectors would this also in
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
essence prohibit those types of Grants
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
from being made unless the school body
 
04:39:57.070 --> 04:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah unless the school body
 
04:39:57.080 --> 04:39:58.708 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah unless the school body
approves

04:39:58.708 --> 04:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
approves
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be honest with you I
 
04:40:04.750 --> 04:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
don't know um I think as far as um your
 
04:40:08.510 --> 04:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
aeds those are donated usually um I know
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
our fire department donates them to to
 
04:40:16.030 --> 04:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
them as far as um actually medication I
 
04:40:18.670 --> 04:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this would fall under
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
medications would fall into this but I'm
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure to be honest with you
 
04:40:26.030 --> 04:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hall Madam chair and
 
04:40:28.230 --> 04:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
04:40:29.708 --> 04:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out where this came
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
from like what precipitated this idea
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
that this was
 
04:40:35.480 --> 04:40:37.350 align:start position:0%
that this was
necessary

04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:40:40.470 --> 04:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
um I actually was asked by a couple of
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
other legislators to do this in other
 
04:40:46.350 --> 04:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
towns where there had been issues and um
 
04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
I I'll go I'll go all the way back okay
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
where I think part partly this came from
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
during covid there were multiple school
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
districts that were an thinking of or or
 
04:41:03.788 --> 04:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
talking about bringing in um providers
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
to um offer vac the vaccine for kids um
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
I know my district was looking into
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
doing in that too um I know it was it
 
04:41:17.948 --> 04:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
was stopped in a lot of them um there
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
are several towns in New Hampshire that
 
04:41:23.948 --> 04:41:23.958 align:start position:0%
actually cities I take it back cities in
 
04:41:26.590 --> 04:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now that actually
 
04:41:31.868 --> 04:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
have um medical facilities within their
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
um comp within their schools um I know
 
04:41:39.868 --> 04:41:39.878 align:start position:0%
Maine is having a big problem with that
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
as far as lawsuit suits are going on
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
because of that because of um lack of
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
Parental uh notification about what
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
services in those
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
um inside the school are being offered
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
by actually it's uh mostly hospitals are
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
that are actually putting them in
 
04:42:04.270 --> 04:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
there's uh lots of lawsuits going on
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
right now in Maine that were brought to
 
04:42:08.830 --> 04:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
our attention so I think it is for the
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
protection um schools are not not in the
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare um that's not their service
 
04:42:19.150 --> 04:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
their service is education um your
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
health care providers in the school are
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
nurses there are strict strict
 
04:42:26.830 --> 04:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines on what a nurse can do
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's strict guidelines about what a
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
social worker can do within a school so
 
04:42:33.868 --> 04:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
I think that this
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
is you protection for the parents
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
protection for the children but I also
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
think it's protection for the school so
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
that if something happens within the
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
school because of something being
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
brought in that is not directly related
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
to its it's what it's supposed to be
 
04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
doing it opens it up for lawsuits
 
04:43:00.510 --> 04:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
so does that answer your question one
 
04:43:04.590 --> 04:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
second um okay the question is um yeah
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I did actually answer my question
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
um you did say that this is it's okay
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
unless the town votes in favor correct
 
04:43:13.948 --> 04:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
how does that happen a warrant warrant
 
04:43:16.670 --> 04:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
sure we for any every single anything
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
any Grant you have to have a warrant
 
04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
number representative may ask where
 
04:43:22.830 --> 04:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
you're from both both well do you have
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
if you're getting a new PR a new police
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
officer do you have it on the warrant
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
article to accept it okay I'm sorry is
 
04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
that inappropriate not questions are
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
going in this direction okay sorry um
 
04:43:41.830 --> 04:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes it would go on the warrant article
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
um it would go on the warrant to article
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
to accept the grant similar to if um the
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
town received a grant for um you know
 
04:43:53.310 --> 04:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
three new police officers for three
 
04:43:55.750 --> 04:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
years that type of thing that's right I
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
think that's the clearest one thank
 
04:44:00.910 --> 04:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you repres Woodcock thank you m
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
chair I I just a
 
04:44:05.948 --> 04:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
clarification you're talking I
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
understand about are you addressing the
 
04:44:11.150 --> 04:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
amendment as well
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
because the amendment's different and I
 
04:44:14.510 --> 04:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
I hear you Crossing back and forth to
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
some of your language the amendment is I
 
04:44:18.270 --> 04:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
do not believe that the amendment is
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
different the amendment says uh well it
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
changes it from schools to school
 
04:44:26.670 --> 04:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
districts so which was a clarification
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
because it really should say districts
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
because it would be the entire District
 
04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
voting on the Grant and it changes the
 
04:44:40.150 --> 04:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
words of um poorly put that it would be
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
the um legislative which is a
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the school district
 
04:44:47.430 --> 04:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
which is the people in the school
 
04:44:52.868 --> 04:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
district to um the um citizens of the
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
municipality M chair may follow follow
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
well it's I can see what you're saying
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
but it's the reverse the bill says the
 
04:45:03.390 --> 04:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
municipality the amendment says the
 
04:45:03.400 --> 04:45:04.628 align:start position:0%
municipality the amendment says the
school

04:45:04.628 --> 04:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:45:07.590 --> 04:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
district right well it does not the the
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
CI you have the bill the citizen right
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's why I'm get
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
I I apologize I apologize that's okay
 
04:45:16.350 --> 04:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
you keep on Crossing back and forth I
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
apologize so the the the the it's the
 
04:45:22.510 --> 04:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the school district
 
04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
I was told that that would be better
 
04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
wording than um the other wording the
 
04:45:30.750 --> 04:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
initial wording I apologize now we now
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
we know where we are I apologize that's
 
04:45:33.788 --> 04:45:33.798 align:start position:0%
okay that's okay I make it all the time
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day across the hall
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but it was the the um so going back
 
04:45:40.390 --> 04:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
if I may go back to that just I sort of
 
04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
on two parts
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of the amendment you
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
said line 7 and8 unless the moving to
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
the last four or five letters u the
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
school district votes in favor of the
 
04:45:54.110 --> 04:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
proposed action so basically there's the
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
first part of the amendment says no
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
unless the school district that would be
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
the I'm guessing the school board
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
because they they're the legislative
 
04:46:05.550 --> 04:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
body of the school district the school
 
04:46:07.470 --> 04:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
board is the legislative body of the
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
school district this no this needs to go
 
04:46:12.910 --> 04:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
before the town it doesn't say that it
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
says unless the legislative body of the
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
school district votes in favor I'm sorry
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
I'm crossing my wires again yes it needs
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
to be approved by the legislative body
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the school district which would be
 
04:46:25.470 --> 04:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
your school board okay so I apologize
 
04:46:25.480 --> 04:46:26.670 align:start position:0%
your school board okay so I apologize
that's

04:46:26.670 --> 04:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
okay yes my chair May
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
finish you may have another question P
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
the same question just try try to get
 
04:46:35.590 --> 04:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
the right the right words okay Goa so
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
back so in that case if they vote one
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
way or the other they can over take it
 
04:46:43.548 --> 04:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
right so I wanted to go back to my
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
original question which was the medical
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
products um they can't apply for Grants
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
or accept grants we just have dialogued
 
04:46:55.270 --> 04:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
this last session and even now this year
 
04:46:59.110 --> 04:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
on epipens right and generic ens yep and
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're not free they're gr funded so
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
for the most part so this the F
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
beginning this would say they can't even
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
apply for it no it's saying that they
 
04:47:13.390 --> 04:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
they cannot acceptance of
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
medical products they need to unless the
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
school board may I chair yes okay going
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
back to the I'm going back to the now
 
04:47:25.708 --> 04:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
let's go back to line six it says a
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
policy prohibit School dist from seeking
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
grants so they can't apply if they can't
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
seek they can't apply you understand I'm
 
04:47:34.270 --> 04:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
saying it says you can't seek it says
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
you cannot seek or accept Okay seek or
 
04:47:42.990 --> 04:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.868 --> 04:47:45.878 align:start position:0%
okay you cor Murray thank you madam
 
04:47:47.708 --> 04:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
question so in the event that um a
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
school nurse would want to pursue an
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh even just look at
 
04:47:59.030 --> 04:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
potentially like Band-Aids or some other
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
type of of need within uh their charge
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
um you're saying that first it would
 
04:48:08.830 --> 04:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
need to be fully approved by the school
 
04:48:10.948 --> 04:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
board to even pursue that versus
 
04:48:12.990 --> 04:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the superintendent or
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
the school board um many times there are
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
processes within a district um if you
 
04:48:21.390 --> 04:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
are um looking uh to have a grant
 
04:48:23.070 --> 04:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
fulfilled in some way you fill out a
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
form uh the administrators take a look
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
at that um so you're saying that that
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
process would not be in place unless the
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
school board would approve each
 
04:48:32.320 --> 04:48:33.750 align:start position:0%
school board would approve each
individual

04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:48:35.948 --> 04:48:35.958 align:start position:0%
instance it's my understanding that
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
right now schools do not have
 
04:48:44.590 --> 04:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
policies around procuring even Band-Aids
 
04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
okay this is to prevent going from
 
04:48:53.070 --> 04:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
asking for Band-Aids to asking
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
for things that would go beyond far
 
04:48:57.680 --> 04:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
for things that would go beyond far
beyond

04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
the treatment of a bruise it's going to
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
say if we say you don't need anything
 
04:49:10.350 --> 04:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
that you can get grants for anything
 
04:49:15.150 --> 04:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
okay with without anybody's approval
 
04:49:19.830 --> 04:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay we can go from Band-Aids to having
 
04:49:23.470 --> 04:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
an approval to have a medical to
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
having a medical facility within without
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
the approval it's to bring it together
 
04:49:34.750 --> 04:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
so that there's oversight on things that
 
04:49:37.548 --> 04:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
are being brought into the school that
 
04:49:41.708 --> 04:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
are Medical in
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
medically bound not educationally bound
 
04:49:50.910 --> 04:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative Marie Madam chair so your
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
is it your is it your assertation or
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
belief that there is not a process
 
04:49:56.830 --> 04:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
currently at all
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
for Grants no I think there is might be
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
a process for Grants but for medical
 
04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
grants I'm talking about we need to make
 
04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
sure that there is a strong policy for
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
medical grants because we do not want I
 
04:50:19.868 --> 04:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
believe schools getting in the business
 
04:50:23.190 --> 04:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
of medical
 
04:50:25.948 --> 04:50:25.958 align:start position:0%
treatment representative
 
04:50:28.110 --> 04:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
04:50:32.548 --> 04:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
this only applies to Grants this does
 
04:50:37.868 --> 04:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
not apply to regular medical first aid
 
04:50:44.830 --> 04:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
than representative bbon thank you madam
 
04:50:49.628 --> 04:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
question um is your opinion that this uh
 
04:50:53.520 --> 04:50:54.868 align:start position:0%
question um is your opinion that this uh
Medical

04:50:54.868 --> 04:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
Medical
 
04:50:58.470 --> 04:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
Services um would include mental health
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
Educational Services Psychological
 
04:51:03.750 --> 04:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
Services um a lot of those are provided
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
under federal grants to the schools they
 
04:51:09.070 --> 04:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
are but it's my understanding that they
 
04:51:10.830 --> 04:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
still have to the grants still have to
 
04:51:10.840 --> 04:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
still have to the grants still have to
be

04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:51:15.310 --> 04:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
approved everything should be approved
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that people are aware of what is
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
going on in the schools I was an
 
04:51:23.510 --> 04:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
intensive care nurse for intensive ER
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
nurse recovery room nurse for 42 years
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
there is a huge difference between
 
04:51:32.990 --> 04:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
education and medic Med and
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
medical issues this is to protect
 
04:51:42.510 --> 04:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
parents teachers staff and students from
 
04:51:45.310 --> 04:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
things being brought into the school
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
that may step over a line of what is
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
school representative
 
04:51:58.830 --> 04:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you m excuse me thank you
 
04:52:00.670 --> 04:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
04:52:02.990 --> 04:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
question I actually have
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
two does this or would this apply to
 
04:52:11.230 --> 04:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
grant funding from a state agent for
 
04:52:13.230 --> 04:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
example from the Department of Health
 
04:52:15.270 --> 04:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
and Human Services might have grant
 
04:52:19.390 --> 04:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
funding available for some aspect of
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
medical products or
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
services so does this apply to Grants
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
from any entity including state or
 
04:52:27.798 --> 04:52:29.390 align:start position:0%
from any entity including state or
federal

04:52:29.390 --> 04:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:52:32.948 --> 04:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay
 
04:52:35.310 --> 04:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
um I have momentarily forgotten my
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'll representative litfield
 
04:52:43.708 --> 04:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:52:45.948 --> 04:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
so originally I was excited because I
 
04:52:51.150 --> 04:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
had thought that you were saying that
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
you wanted this to go before the
 
04:52:56.190 --> 04:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
legislative body as in the voters
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
because so I I my question is I just
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
want to clarify because my feeling was
 
04:53:03.070 --> 04:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
that's great because so often we get
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
these large grants and then when the
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
grant runs out all of a sudden we're
 
04:53:10.628 --> 04:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
expected to absorb these into the budget
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
and it it could be six figures or more
 
04:53:14.830 --> 04:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
corre so I just want to clarify do do
 
04:53:17.470 --> 04:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
you mean just the school board or do you
 
04:53:20.230 --> 04:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
mean the actual legislative body that
 
04:53:22.310 --> 04:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
votes let's say at deliberative session
 
04:53:24.750 --> 04:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
or at the school district meeting I had
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
originally put it in as the citizens of
 
04:53:28.200 --> 04:53:29.070 align:start position:0%
originally put it in as the citizens of
the

04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:53:31.070 --> 04:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
municipality I was
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
advised I was advised that in order to
 
04:53:37.708 --> 04:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
make it more palatable I'm being honest
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
with you that it should be it should be
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative body of the school book
 
04:53:46.708 --> 04:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
I know I it's
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
called bringing it to make it more
 
04:53:55.708 --> 04:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
palatable follow up yes please thank you
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you I just want to clarify
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm wondering if if maybe an
 
04:54:02.430 --> 04:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is order in order so you're
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying as representative Freeman
 
04:54:08.110 --> 04:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
asked that um they could apply for
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
grants that has anything to do with
 
04:54:12.990 --> 04:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
emergency supplies emergency medical
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.230 --> 04:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
there you can't apply well not so you do
 
04:54:25.868 --> 04:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
not want them to be able to apply for
 
04:54:25.878 --> 04:54:29.270 align:start position:0%
not want them to be able to apply for
emergency

04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
supplies okay wait a minute
 
04:54:36.830 --> 04:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
so already okay
 
04:54:42.430 --> 04:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
one question at a time may I tell you a
 
04:54:50.590 --> 04:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
story about Maine what's happened in
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
Maine no
 
04:54:57.470 --> 04:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm trying to protect I I
 
04:55:01.510 --> 04:55:01.520 align:start position:0%

04:55:12.400 --> 04:55:14.590 align:start position:0%

04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
story where was it in response to a
 
04:55:22.830 --> 04:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
question that was just asked I thought
 
04:55:24.910 --> 04:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the amendment or
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.190 --> 04:55:32.200 align:start position:0%

04:55:34.990 --> 04:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative moris uh thank you madam
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:55:38.190 --> 04:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
question uh in earlier in your testimony
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned about the things that
 
04:55:41.628 --> 04:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
are happening in various States and this
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
would be kind of more of a proactive way
 
04:55:45.310 --> 04:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
to stop stuff like that from happening
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned specific to Maine and some
 
04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
of us have heard what is happening in
 
04:55:51.750 --> 04:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
Maine and would you like to clarify a
 
04:55:55.150 --> 04:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
little bit about that Maine it's my
 
04:55:57.230 --> 04:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that Maine has in several
 
04:55:59.948 --> 04:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
areas they are actually having different
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals putting clinics within the
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
schools and the story that some of us
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
heard during um was the story about um
 
04:56:13.390 --> 04:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
group of young girls 15 going and saying
 
04:56:15.310 --> 04:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
okay let's all get birth control nothing
 
04:56:17.948 --> 04:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
B matter with that it's legal but the
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
problem is is that the pharmacy preside
 
04:56:24.150 --> 04:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
Pro provides it the parents don't know
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
which is legal and they had a case and
 
04:56:29.868 --> 04:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
there's been other cases but the one
 
04:56:32.510 --> 04:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
case that's struck in my mind is that a
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
young girl um had an an injury that
 
04:56:40.350 --> 04:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
required surgery and no one knew that
 
04:56:44.270 --> 04:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
she was on any type of birth control and
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
Sen pz
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah tell the story could we just talk
 
04:56:51.948 --> 04:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
about grants please
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay sorry I thought he wanted the story
 
04:56:58.590 --> 04:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
sorry any other questions representive
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
Corell thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question in the
 
04:57:04.510 --> 04:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
methodology um this said this could
 
04:57:08.670 --> 04:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
affect federal grants also yes and so um
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
in 2425
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
our federal grants totaled $116
 
04:57:16.670 --> 04:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
million so in effect if we don't get
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
these federal grants does not that cost
 
04:57:22.788 --> 04:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
of providing Services fall to the
 
04:57:24.990 --> 04:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in the local
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
community do we get grants specifically
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
for medical products I I I really am not
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
clear of what you mean by medical
 
04:57:36.030 --> 04:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
services and medical products anyway so
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
I I think that if the Department of
 
04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
Education said this could impact feral
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
Federal programs idea Title One Title 1
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
C Title 1 D mckenny vinto which are affs
 
04:57:50.150 --> 04:57:50.160 align:start position:0%

homeless people if we're going to lose
$116

04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
million I do not believe that is the
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
intent of this the intent is at at the
 
04:58:03.270 --> 04:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
school district level to protect the
 
04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
schools representative Woodcock thank
 
04:58:08.230 --> 04:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
you madam shair um I just want to go
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
back to represent P I appreciate you
 
04:58:12.150 --> 04:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
your your testimony the other day
 
04:58:13.590 --> 04:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
particularly your background emercy
 
04:58:16.910 --> 04:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
Services was really valid but in this
 
04:58:20.190 --> 04:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
particular case I'm concerned where um
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
protocols in schools uh having been in
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
the school business for almost 40 years
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
too many almost to many years her um
 
04:58:29.910 --> 04:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
that I've never seen a
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
grant uh
 
04:58:33.868 --> 04:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
submitted without approval of the
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
superintendent in the school boy I I
 
04:58:39.190 --> 04:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
heard you use the term strong policy
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
local school boyss have those policies
 
04:58:42.708 --> 04:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
i' and I've never I've been I worked in
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
Maine in New Hampshire Massachusetts uh
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
and never ever have I seen a grant come
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
from a
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
teacher or or a a school administrator
 
04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
without going to superintendent and then
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
being approved by the school board
 
04:58:57.310 --> 04:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
different from seeking Grant or looking
 
04:58:59.910 --> 04:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
for money additional monies so are you
 
04:59:02.430 --> 04:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
aware of any grants in New Hampshire
 
04:59:04.190 --> 04:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
where they bypass a superintendent
 
04:59:06.830 --> 04:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
bypass the school board and and gone to
 
04:59:09.750 --> 04:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
directly to I've never seen it 40 Years
 
04:59:11.230 --> 04:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
no I haven't seen that but I also was
 
04:59:16.150 --> 04:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
shocked as when I was here before that
 
04:59:19.628 --> 04:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
there was no policy for emergent care so
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
these are medical grants these are not
 
04:59:22.000 --> 04:59:23.350 align:start position:0%
these are medical grants these are not
educational

04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
educational
 
04:59:26.350 --> 04:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
grants and your your superintendent and
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
all are and teacher and superintendent
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard are not
 
04:59:34.590 --> 04:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily medical people they are
 
04:59:37.150 --> 04:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
Educators mostly but not necessarily
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
medical it's separating the educational
 
04:59:43.230 --> 04:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
Grant from a medical
 
04:59:46.030 --> 04:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
Grant oh just just my point my point was
 
04:59:48.110 --> 04:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
not that it's separating anything
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
because the process is every single
 
04:59:51.788 --> 04:59:51.798 align:start position:0%
Grant has to go through the school
 
04:59:54.070 --> 04:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
board I I think in reality you're
 
04:59:55.230 --> 04:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:59:58.110 --> 04:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
Services the intent of the bill was to
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
identify services that may or may not be
 
05:00:01.708 --> 05:00:01.718 align:start position:0%
happening in some schools that you
 
05:00:03.548 --> 05:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
believe happening during the day but
 
05:00:06.750 --> 05:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
that but the the rest of this is really
 
05:00:08.830 --> 05:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
confusing what you're trying to get to
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
because you're you're rting schools and
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
you're putting process already in place
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
you understand me are we sure they're in
 
05:00:18.030 --> 05:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
place thank you thank you sh
 
05:00:18.040 --> 05:00:19.230 align:start position:0%
place thank you thank you sh
representative

05:00:19.230 --> 05:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you madam
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
chair so in the past like 25 plus years
 
05:00:28.160 --> 05:00:29.190 align:start position:0%
chair so in the past like 25 plus years
ago

05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
probably a local
 
05:00:34.430 --> 05:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
hospital um in my
 
05:00:38.270 --> 05:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
district opened a clinic to provide
 
05:00:40.590 --> 05:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
preventive health care and well ESS care
 
05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
to teens and they leased space from a
 
05:00:47.548 --> 05:00:47.558 align:start position:0%
public high school to do that the school
 
05:00:50.830 --> 05:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
had space not being used the hospital
 
05:00:52.548 --> 05:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring Services more
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
conveniently to where the students
 
05:00:55.280 --> 05:00:56.708 align:start position:0%
conveniently to where the students
generally

05:00:56.708 --> 05:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
generally
 
05:00:59.830 --> 05:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
are that particular Clinic doesn't exist
 
05:01:02.910 --> 05:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
anymore um but I think that's not an
 
05:01:06.030 --> 05:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
unusual model in many
 
05:01:11.628 --> 05:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
states yes um thank you um so how would
 
05:01:15.230 --> 05:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation impact a
 
05:01:18.510 --> 05:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
clinic run in a school facility but not
 
05:01:21.948 --> 05:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
run by the school so the hospital or
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
other entity medical providers are
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
simply leasing the space and then they
 
05:01:33.270 --> 05:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:35.948 --> 05:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
grants if they're leasing the space they
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
would certainly need to be able to get
 
05:01:40.510 --> 05:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
approval correct
 
05:01:43.110 --> 05:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
approval for the lease approval to have
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
the space within the school and for the
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes I can't ask a question clarification
 
05:01:54.510 --> 05:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to be perfectly honest
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
with you we should not be having medical
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
facilities within the schools that
 
05:02:01.230 --> 05:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
should not be happening in my opinion
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
having been in medical facilities so we
 
05:02:05.430 --> 05:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
should not be having them in the
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
schools schools are for education in my
 
05:02:08.160 --> 05:02:10.750 align:start position:0%
schools schools are for education in my
opinion

05:02:10.750 --> 05:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
I want to stop us from running into
 
05:02:14.548 --> 05:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
trouble talking about
 
05:02:17.430 --> 05:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
grants any other
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair I almost said
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
good morning how this week has been so
 
05:02:47.910 --> 05:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
crazy all of you uh thank you for
 
05:02:49.750 --> 05:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony today for the
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
record I'm Becky Wilson from the New
 
05:02:53.670 --> 05:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association um I
 
05:02:55.548 --> 05:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
have not seen the amendment so I cannot
 
05:02:58.230 --> 05:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
speak to the language of that um I am
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
going to ask a couple of clarifications
 
05:03:02.548 --> 05:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
oh thank you representative much
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
appreciated uh regarding the original
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill and I will try to doubly read and
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
ask questions about the amendment as
 
05:03:12.310 --> 05:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
well or I bring up concerns um our
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
reading of this bill I I think in its
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation at least the original
 
05:03:18.670 --> 05:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
bill this absolutely would impact
 
05:03:21.070 --> 05:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
District's abilities to procure things
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
like epipens Naran aeds um and even
 
05:03:28.510 --> 05:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
still I do believe supplies potentially
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
for the nurse's office or for um jump
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
kits or you know those things that you
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
take in an emergency situation the
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
buckets Etc um CPR courses or post con
 
05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
impact testing uh line five does say any
 
05:03:47.110 --> 05:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
related money is procuring medical
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
products or services so funds to procure
 
05:03:52.948 --> 05:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
them that's any funds I believe um it
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
does it says or funds so it doesn't say
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
and um I'm not I'm not sure I realized
 
05:04:00.190 --> 05:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
that may not have been the intention of
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill to cover all of
 
05:04:04.110 --> 05:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
those things but I believe the way that
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's written in line five that it would
 
05:04:08.350 --> 05:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
certainly impact all of those things not
 
05:04:11.670 --> 05:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
just grants um I share the concern
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
around the wording of um it shall
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit schools from seeking grants so
 
05:04:22.230 --> 05:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure um how a district would
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
turn off their ability to seek a grant I
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
mean you we are constantly getting
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
information from the Department of
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
Education for example uh from other
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
partner organizations who potentially
 
05:04:35.548 --> 05:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
are putting out information about grants
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
that could be available to school
 
05:04:40.590 --> 05:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
districts uh I don't know how don't then
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
pot you just I guess ignore those emails
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
and documents coming from the Department
 
05:04:47.230 --> 05:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't if you're not allowed to
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
even seek them out or to get more
 
05:04:50.990 --> 05:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
clarification about that it's a little
 
05:04:52.990 --> 05:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
bit concerning that that wording in
 
05:04:56.430 --> 05:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
there uh I also share a concern about
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that this seems to be stating
 
05:05:02.830 --> 05:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
that you could not accept or even apply
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
for a grant unless the voters vote that
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
that you can do that that typically is
 
05:05:11.350 --> 05:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
in March so what happens if a grant
 
05:05:14.190 --> 05:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity comes out in August um and
 
05:05:16.868 --> 05:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
the deadline to apply for that is
 
05:05:19.070 --> 05:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
October then the districts are just not
 
05:05:20.910 --> 05:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
applying I would imagine or they're
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to wait till next march to ask a
 
05:05:25.350 --> 05:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
question that's irrelevant at that point
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
um would you call a special meeting I'm
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
not sure how that would exactly play out
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
um I will just I I won't go down the
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole however I will speak to this
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
issue about the the programmatic
 
05:05:42.350 --> 05:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
concerns from Maine um that specific
 
05:05:44.548 --> 05:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
Grant is called Community Schools Grant
 
05:05:45.868 --> 05:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
I think we've spoken about that in
 
05:05:48.430 --> 05:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
regards to a different Bill however that
 
05:05:51.708 --> 05:05:51.718 align:start position:0%
Grant was put into the main state budget
 
05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
by the main legislature for five schools
 
05:05:56.708 --> 05:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
to participate so that is why those five
 
05:06:00.030 --> 05:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
schools are seeking those grants um it
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
was a legislative action that was taken
 
05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
by their legislature to try to build
 
05:06:08.110 --> 05:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
those Community Partnerships within
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
their state I so it's very specific
 
05:06:13.548 --> 05:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
however it also Community Schools cover
 
05:06:15.628 --> 05:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
24 different things that are they are
 
05:06:17.230 --> 05:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
bringing to the school district of which
 
05:06:19.830 --> 05:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
one is a primary care service model in
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
partnership with local Health agencies
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
so there's 23 other things that come
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
with Community Schools that is not
 
05:06:29.548 --> 05:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
solely about medical services in
 
05:06:32.070 --> 05:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
schools um and just to clarify New
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think currently has four
 
05:06:36.830 --> 05:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
Community Health Partnerships or
 
05:06:39.628 --> 05:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
community health organizations that are
 
05:06:43.390 --> 05:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
I think to the previous speaker comment
 
05:06:45.070 --> 05:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term renting a
 
05:06:47.390 --> 05:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
space in a school district to provide
 
05:06:49.868 --> 05:06:49.878 align:start position:0%
convenient Primary Care Services to
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
families who are using that as their
 
05:06:51.760 --> 05:06:52.830 align:start position:0%
families who are using that as their
Primary

05:06:52.830 --> 05:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
Primary
 
05:06:56.990 --> 05:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
Care um servicer uh I believe those are
 
05:06:59.310 --> 05:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
summersworth Newport Manchester and
 
05:07:01.590 --> 05:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
Rochester they are Partnerships with
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals or other medical entities they
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
are not run by School staff as I think
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
we talked about in other bills
 
05:07:11.590 --> 05:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
um I do have a question about whether or
 
05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
not this would impact the district's
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
ability to accept funds even from our
 
05:07:16.990 --> 05:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education that is
 
05:07:19.070 --> 05:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
the flow through for Federal grant
 
05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
monies that potentially could be tied
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
back to some sort of medical service or
 
05:07:29.110 --> 05:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
product um does this affect medically
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
necessary services that are being
 
05:07:32.590 --> 05:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
provided at school for students through
 
05:07:35.230 --> 05:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
idea that fall under Medicaid to schools
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
would that mean that we could not as a
 
05:07:38.948 --> 05:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
district participate in Medicaid to
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
schools what it mean we can't take idea
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
funds from the flow through at the state
 
05:07:46.350 --> 05:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
level to cover students medically
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
necessary services like occupational
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
therapy or speech um and just to clean
 
05:07:53.310 --> 05:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
up the fact that um there's a concern
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
that when grants go away districts have
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
to hold the bag for whatever they've put
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
in place certainly that is always a
 
05:08:00.270 --> 05:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
concern I think we've heard a lot about
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
that over the last couple of years in
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
regards to the Esser funds because that
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
was such a big influx of funds to
 
05:08:08.430 --> 05:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
districts um that we knew was going to
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
go away um there is a criteria in almost
 
05:08:12.990 --> 05:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
all federal grants called maintenance of
 
05:08:14.590 --> 05:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
effort where the district has to
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
consider what portion of those services
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
that you're obtaining with the grant you
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
are going to put into your operating
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
budget at the start in order to maintain
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
your effort to continue to provide those
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
Services it is not fair to families or
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
students or staff to give them something
 
05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
and then just blanketly take it away
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
when that money runs out so that
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort is something
 
05:08:36.430 --> 05:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
that's required in almost every single
 
05:08:40.110 --> 05:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
Grant application um and it is meant to
 
05:08:41.788 --> 05:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
be protective to the district and to the
 
05:08:43.590 --> 05:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
families of the district so that that
 
05:08:45.548 --> 05:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
Cliff doesn't happen and those services
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
that you've been providing don't just go
 
05:08:50.548 --> 05:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
away on the um positive outlook that
 
05:08:52.110 --> 05:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
those services are being helpful to
 
05:08:54.110 --> 05:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
students and families so I'm happy to
 
05:08:56.470 --> 05:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you
 
05:08:58.350 --> 05:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
question my question is around sort of
 
05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
that Grant process in general is it is
 
05:09:10.590 --> 05:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
it a common practice first to um
 
05:09:13.868 --> 05:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
if if an if a nurse or any other entity
 
05:09:16.190 --> 05:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
is is Seeking a grant they would first
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
go to the superintendent and discuss the
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
desire to seek a grant uh thank you for
 
05:09:23.788 --> 05:09:23.798 align:start position:0%
the question representative there are
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
multiple kinds of Grants I mean
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
obviously you're there's grants that are
 
05:09:29.470 --> 05:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
obligated to you from the Department as
 
05:09:31.510 --> 05:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
the flow through things like idea Title
 
05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
One your title grants Etc um those
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
typically don't um have re-approval
 
05:09:39.548 --> 05:09:39.558 align:start position:0%
every single year you know that that
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
money is coming you know what you're
 
05:09:43.948 --> 05:09:43.958 align:start position:0%
going to be given by the state and so
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
those have a somewhat different process
 
05:09:47.948 --> 05:09:47.958 align:start position:0%
I would say um competitive grants are
 
05:09:49.750 --> 05:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
something different where obviously
 
05:09:51.788 --> 05:09:51.798 align:start position:0%
those are put out on an ongoing basis by
 
05:09:54.150 --> 05:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
lots of different organizations um in
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
which case yes if anybody at a school
 
05:09:59.788 --> 05:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
level is looking seeking out a grant it
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
is almost never that the school can
 
05:10:04.150 --> 05:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
submit the grant without some sort of
 
05:10:06.150 --> 05:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
approval at a higher level whether
 
05:10:08.230 --> 05:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's the superintendent and the school
 
05:10:10.390 --> 05:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
board on the School Board would have to
 
05:10:13.150 --> 05:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
vote to accept those funds at some level
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh if they were to give be provided the
 
05:10:17.190 --> 05:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant if they win the grant
 
05:10:18.868 --> 05:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
um you know all of those things have to
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
be accepted in terms of school board's
 
05:10:23.910 --> 05:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
ability to manage federal funds there
 
05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
and other kinds of funds there are um
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
priority policies that are required by
 
05:10:33.430 --> 05:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
law um in New Hampshire policy daf
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
administration of Federal grant funds
 
05:10:36.628 --> 05:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
walks you through exactly how those
 
05:10:38.628 --> 05:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
funds need to be managed at the board
 
05:10:42.030 --> 05:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
level um and there is also a policy that
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
is mandated by law uh jlc which is in
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
regards to Emergency Care at school and
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
what to do and what school boards can
 
05:10:52.030 --> 05:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
and cannot do what staff can and cannot
 
05:10:54.150 --> 05:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
do in regards to an emergency medical
 
05:10:57.190 --> 05:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
situation um and to try to you know put
 
05:10:59.548 --> 05:10:59.558 align:start position:0%
the minds of some other people's at ease
 
05:11:02.350 --> 05:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
that it's very clear what a school board
 
05:11:04.590 --> 05:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
or a school staff can do in an emergency
 
05:11:06.270 --> 05:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
situation in terms of medical care and
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:11:19.070 --> 05:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:28.030 --> 05:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:30.190 --> 05:11:30.200 align:start position:0%

nonprofit organization that solves
 
05:11:40.750 --> 05:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
problems through policy change we are
 
05:11:43.230 --> 05:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to House Bill 695 as
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
written just because of a few um
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
concerns we have with the language um
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
specifically that medically related is
 
05:11:55.510 --> 05:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
not defined um to one of your points I
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
can't remember who brought it up um it's
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
unclear to us whether or not this um
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
involves Med Mental Health Services that
 
05:12:05.670 --> 05:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
are often Grant funded and really do a
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
lot of work to partner parents with the
 
05:12:10.548 --> 05:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
schools in connecting them to Services
 
05:12:13.350 --> 05:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
outside of the school um in a situation
 
05:12:16.150 --> 05:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
where we have a huge Workforce crisis
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
and parents are facing really long wait
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
lists it's helpful to have um those
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
services available to students both in
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
school and out of school when parents
 
05:12:26.708 --> 05:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
need the services for their
 
05:12:29.470 --> 05:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
child um the other component to this
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
that we're concerned about is the
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
prevention piece there are State
 
05:12:34.390 --> 05:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
organizations um the governor's
 
05:12:36.750 --> 05:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
commission that have grants that go I
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
believe to schools for prevention of
 
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
substance use and other risky behaviors
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
risky Health behaviors um so I think
 
05:12:46.590 --> 05:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to make sure that those
 
05:12:48.990 --> 05:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
Grant dollars are still available for
 
05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
programs that uh students parents and
 
05:12:54.070 --> 05:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
schools rely on um happy to take
 
05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any

Region
 
05:21:49.150 --> 05:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
um some of you who are here last term
 
05:21:52.590 --> 05:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
might remember uh this legislation from
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
last year um is basically the same
 
05:22:00.430 --> 05:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think it
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislation uh because what we've seen
 
05:22:11.070 --> 05:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
around the nation but also here in New
 
05:22:14.230 --> 05:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I just I happened to
 
05:22:17.788 --> 05:22:17.798 align:start position:0%
see this one story the other day
 
05:22:22.070 --> 05:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
um uh a main sixth grade student 11
 
05:22:24.990 --> 05:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
years old uh testifying at a school
 
05:22:27.948 --> 05:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
board meeting about a pornographic book
 
05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
he found in school
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
library and in his testimony he said the
 
05:22:35.350 --> 05:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
librarian asked him if he wanted a
 
05:22:39.548 --> 05:22:39.558 align:start position:0%
graphic version of the book
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
um that's an example of why we need this
 
05:22:45.548 --> 05:22:45.558 align:start position:0%
legislation and this
 
05:22:49.310 --> 05:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislation addresses age appropriate
 
05:22:51.868 --> 05:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
and materials that are harmful to minors
 
05:22:51.878 --> 05:22:52.868 align:start position:0%
and materials that are harmful to minors
in

05:22:52.868 --> 05:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
schools and there are three basic
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
components uh to the uh to the
 
05:23:04.990 --> 05:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
legislation the first is section one at
 
05:23:05.000 --> 05:23:06.030 align:start position:0%
legislation the first is section one at
the

05:23:06.030 --> 05:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:23:09.350 --> 05:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
top um which is our Criminal
 
05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
statutes uh
 
05:23:16.390 --> 05:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
650 uh statutes in particular right
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
now uh educational
 
05:23:23.190 --> 05:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
institutions are exempt from our
 
05:23:23.200 --> 05:23:25.910 align:start position:0%
institutions are exempt from our
obscenity

05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
laws um let me just mention that
 
05:23:32.110 --> 05:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
obscenity is not protected by the First
 
05:23:34.590 --> 05:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment um that was the Roth versus
 
05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
United States uh Supreme Court decision
 
05:23:40.510 --> 05:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
7 this
 
05:23:47.750 --> 05:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um Alters that exemption to
 
05:23:49.628 --> 05:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
maintain an exemption for higher
 
05:23:53.948 --> 05:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
education but not K12
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
education um the second section really
 
05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
deals with the
 
05:24:04.830 --> 05:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
harmful um materials to Miners and the
 
05:24:09.430 --> 05:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
definitions uh these definitions are Tak
 
05:24:09.440 --> 05:24:10.470 align:start position:0%
definitions uh these definitions are Tak
um

05:24:10.470 --> 05:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:15.070 --> 05:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
from Court decisions um originating with
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
New York penal
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
law um and
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh there are definitions on the first
 
05:24:26.270 --> 05:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
page and over on the second page um
 
05:24:30.070 --> 05:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see the definition for when
 
05:24:32.708 --> 05:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
materials are harmful to minors that's
 
05:24:35.590 --> 05:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
in Roman 2 on page
 
05:24:39.948 --> 05:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
two uh again this is been held upheld by
 
05:24:46.150 --> 05:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court and is in um 20
 
05:24:48.590 --> 05:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
USC code
 
05:24:48.600 --> 05:24:50.390 align:start position:0%
USC code
9134

05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
9134
 
05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:57.948 --> 05:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
also and I think that's very important
 
05:25:00.830 --> 05:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll just mention um that uh I
 
05:25:02.910 --> 05:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
worked with the new yor excuse me the
 
05:25:05.390 --> 05:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire attorney general um on
 
05:25:09.670 --> 05:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation and these um def
 
05:25:12.430 --> 05:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
definitions the third main component to
 
05:25:16.628 --> 05:25:16.638 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill uh starts on line 20 on
 
05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
page two uh excuse me now I might be
 
05:25:21.470 --> 05:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
looking at a different version than you
 
05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
are but it's um uh
 
05:25:27.390 --> 05:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
18976 the complaint process it should be
 
05:25:28.948 --> 05:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
on the second page as
 
05:25:32.948 --> 05:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
well um and this lays out a minimum
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
requirements uh for
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
complaints um we have have so much in
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
statute about parental involvement in
 
05:25:47.070 --> 05:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
education um it's right at the top of
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
our statutes um on
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
education um and parents need a way to
 
05:25:59.470 --> 05:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
address the situation when they find
 
05:26:01.948 --> 05:26:01.958 align:start position:0%
materials that are harmful to minors and
 
05:26:04.910 --> 05:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
this lays out the minimum process
 
05:26:07.670 --> 05:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
starting with uh complaints to the uh
 
05:26:07.680 --> 05:26:08.910 align:start position:0%
starting with uh complaints to the uh
principal

05:26:08.910 --> 05:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
principal
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
then um appeals when necessary um to the
 
05:26:14.750 --> 05:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent and to the school board
 
05:26:18.190 --> 05:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
which is um over on page
 
05:26:23.708 --> 05:26:23.718 align:start position:0%
three and finally the um uh parent if
 
05:26:26.470 --> 05:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
they uh have not received satisfaction
 
05:26:30.830 --> 05:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
at that level they can appeal to the uh
 
05:26:32.310 --> 05:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
State Board of
 
05:26:36.270 --> 05:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
Education which is their um right under
 
05:26:38.670 --> 05:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
existing law elsewhere that is just been
 
05:26:43.070 --> 05:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
referenced here um in
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
that uh RSA 21 and 11 under the duties
 
05:26:53.310 --> 05:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
of the school board uh Roman 3 says Hear
 
05:26:56.270 --> 05:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
appeals and isue decisions which shall
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
be considered final decisions of the
 
05:27:00.830 --> 05:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education of any dispute
 
05:27:04.350 --> 05:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
between individuals and school
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
systems so this is a right of parents to
 
05:27:10.750 --> 05:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
continue their appeal process up to the
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%

provided for um each of those steps in
 
05:27:20.040 --> 05:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
provided for um each of those steps in
the

05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:27:25.548 --> 05:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
process the uh fourth
 
05:27:27.548 --> 05:27:27.558 align:start position:0%
section of the
 
05:27:29.628 --> 05:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
18977 and enforcement and penalties and
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
this is a civil
 
05:27:37.510 --> 05:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
section um in my discussions with the
 
05:27:40.910 --> 05:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
attorney en he admitted that it would be
 
05:27:45.030 --> 05:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
very very rare for a situation to
 
05:27:49.910 --> 05:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
escalate um in a school to a a criminal
 
05:27:49.920 --> 05:27:50.948 align:start position:0%
escalate um in a school to a a criminal
uh

05:27:50.948 --> 05:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
case um so we added this civil
 
05:28:00.030 --> 05:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
section um and I'll just say generally
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know my thought that um if there is
 
05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh no enforcement in legislation it's
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
really just a
 
05:28:13.230 --> 05:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
suggestion so we have this enforcement
 
05:28:13.240 --> 05:28:13.948 align:start position:0%
suggestion so we have this enforcement
uh

05:28:13.948 --> 05:28:13.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:17.110 --> 05:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism under two conditions can a
 
05:28:22.590 --> 05:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
civil um case be launched and that is
 
05:28:26.230 --> 05:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
when um the decision of a school or
 
05:28:28.628 --> 05:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
School District or the school board has
 
05:28:30.948 --> 05:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
not been adhered to so if the
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent says yes this is age
 
05:28:35.708 --> 05:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
inappropriate should not be in a Middle
 
05:28:39.390 --> 05:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
School uh move it to the high school or
 
05:28:41.708 --> 05:28:41.718 align:start position:0%
um this shouldn't be in our schools at
 
05:28:46.510 --> 05:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
all um if that is not heered to uh the
 
05:28:50.030 --> 05:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh parents would have uh civil
 
05:28:54.030 --> 05:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
action the other option is that
 
05:28:54.040 --> 05:28:55.788 align:start position:0%
action the other option is that
when

05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
um basically similar to that um in that
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
the um material is made available to the
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
minor in a matter that's not consistent
 
05:29:11.430 --> 05:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
with the final decision
 
05:29:14.990 --> 05:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
um in either case the petitioner could
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
be warded uh general or special damages
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
by the civil
 
05:29:26.548 --> 05:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:26.558 --> 05:29:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:29:28.430 --> 05:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:29:32.350 --> 05:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable legislation based on uh all
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
the instances um we have seen um many of
 
05:29:39.190 --> 05:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
you who were here last term on the
 
05:29:41.830 --> 05:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
combined education committee uh remember
 
05:29:45.628 --> 05:29:45.638 align:start position:0%
that there were many examples of these
 
05:29:49.230 --> 05:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
types of materials handed out in our
 
05:29:51.948 --> 05:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
committee with members refusing to look
 
05:29:54.548 --> 05:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
at them even though that they were in
 
05:29:54.558 --> 05:29:55.830 align:start position:0%
at them even though that they were in
our

05:29:55.830 --> 05:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
schools and on the house floor members
 
05:30:01.948 --> 05:30:01.958 align:start position:0%
reluctant to
 
05:30:05.270 --> 05:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
hear from these materials that are in
 
05:30:05.280 --> 05:30:06.628 align:start position:0%
hear from these materials that are in
their

05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
schools um
 
05:30:14.110 --> 05:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
so I I think that parents need a
 
05:30:18.990 --> 05:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism and this in legislation is in
 
05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
in intended to provide uh a minimum uh
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
process for a resolution of Parental
 
05:30:30.590 --> 05:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
complaints thank you thank you are there
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
any questions or was I have
 
05:30:35.310 --> 05:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
NATO thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:30:36.670 --> 05:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question and bringing this
 
05:30:40.390 --> 05:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
forward to us so I had a question on
 
05:30:40.400 --> 05:30:41.350 align:start position:0%
forward to us so I had a question on
page

05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:30:41.360 --> 05:30:42.948 align:start position:0%
page
two

05:30:42.948 --> 05:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:30:46.150 --> 05:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh line 36 uh
 
05:30:46.160 --> 05:30:48.070 align:start position:0%
uh line 36 uh
throughout

05:30:48.070 --> 05:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
05:30:51.910 --> 05:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
the the school principal or his or her
 
05:30:54.310 --> 05:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
design shall determine whether the
 
05:30:56.830 --> 05:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
material is the subject of the complaint
 
05:30:59.628 --> 05:30:59.638 align:start position:0%
is harmful to miners do you think it
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
should be more uh brought to like the
 
05:31:06.990 --> 05:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
school board and not just have one
 
05:31:10.030 --> 05:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
person uh uh making that decision that
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
would be part of the complaint process
 
05:31:14.990 --> 05:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
if you know start out with the principal
 
05:31:19.830 --> 05:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
and um when necessary um go up uh um to
 
05:31:22.590 --> 05:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
higher levels up uh through the State
 
05:31:23.628 --> 05:31:23.638 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
05:31:26.390 --> 05:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
Education but I I think it's uh
 
05:31:29.628 --> 05:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable to start out at school level
 
05:31:29.638 --> 05:31:30.788 align:start position:0%
reasonable to start out at school level
thank

05:31:30.788 --> 05:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:31:33.830 --> 05:31:33.840 align:start position:0%

Hall thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:31:38.110 --> 05:31:38.120 align:start position:0%

05:31:40.590 --> 05:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
only Public Schools or public charter
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
schools or private schools religious
 
05:31:46.590 --> 05:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
Schools they're all

yeah um I'm not touching um with this
 
05:32:00.990 --> 05:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
schools follow up follow I'm just
 
05:32:05.150 --> 05:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
wondering about the charter schools I
 
05:32:06.830 --> 05:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
thought attorney Clinton had said that
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
it needed to say start of school do it
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
it um yeah I'm not I'm not sure
 
05:32:24.310 --> 05:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
um if this does say Public public Char
 
05:32:27.470 --> 05:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
of schools or not to be honest okay
 
05:32:27.480 --> 05:32:29.350 align:start position:0%
of schools or not to be honest okay
thank

madam chair thanks for taking my
 
05:32:36.070 --> 05:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
question I I did have a question I
 
05:32:37.868 --> 05:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
believe I thought I heard you say that
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
you are referencing on page two one um
 
05:32:44.270 --> 05:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
line 20 under the complaint process you
 
05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
would uh said
 
05:32:57.190 --> 05:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not sure if I did say that I
 
05:33:02.670 --> 05:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
might have said that but I was looking
 
05:33:05.430 --> 05:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
at a marked up version okay
 
05:33:08.270 --> 05:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
um uh of the bill rather
 
05:33:10.590 --> 05:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
the one that you're looking at I see and
 
05:33:13.990 --> 05:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
follow up follow thank you um additional
 
05:33:17.310 --> 05:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
question do districts already have um
 
05:33:19.628 --> 05:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
challenge uh policies in place if they
 
05:33:21.750 --> 05:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
find objectionable material if a parent
 
05:33:23.350 --> 05:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
feels like there's a material that is
 
05:33:25.390 --> 05:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
objectionable are you aware any
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
districts who already have the I I
 
05:33:28.470 --> 05:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
believe there are districts that have a
 
05:33:31.788 --> 05:33:31.798 align:start position:0%
process I just want to make um uh
 
05:33:33.788 --> 05:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
setting a floor if you will in terms of
 
05:33:36.750 --> 05:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
that process and make sure that parents
 
05:33:39.948 --> 05:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
um are aware of their rights to appeal
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
to the State Board as
 
05:33:44.670 --> 05:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
well any other
 
05:33:47.350 --> 05:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
questions repesent Cornell Thank you
 
05:33:49.150 --> 05:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
05:33:51.070 --> 05:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
question isn't it already against the
 
05:33:53.430 --> 05:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
law to give these kind of materials or
 
05:33:57.310 --> 05:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
make available to miners these kinds of
 
05:33:57.320 --> 05:33:59.110 align:start position:0%
make available to miners these kinds of
materials

05:33:59.110 --> 05:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
materials
 
05:34:04.510 --> 05:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure where it is um against
 
05:34:07.390 --> 05:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
the uh statutes in New Hampshire but I
 
05:34:12.510 --> 05:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
think that um what we need to do is um
 
05:34:14.670 --> 05:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
lay out a minimum complaint process but
 
05:34:18.070 --> 05:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
also uh set an enforcement mechanism
 
05:34:20.310 --> 05:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
when required and I don't believe that
 
05:34:22.868 --> 05:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
that's anywhere in
 
05:34:26.390 --> 05:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
statute follow well another question
 
05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so
 
05:34:32.590 --> 05:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
it said that there would be um damages
 
05:34:34.628 --> 05:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
of $1,000 for each violation and cost
 
05:34:36.390 --> 05:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
and reasonable legal fees who would pay
 
05:34:38.990 --> 05:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
that would that be the Local District or
 
05:34:41.470 --> 05:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers who would have to pay for
 
05:34:45.948 --> 05:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
that if that was found U well U the
 
05:34:45.958 --> 05:34:47.350 align:start position:0%
that if that was found U well U the
school

05:34:47.350 --> 05:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:34:49.628 --> 05:34:49.638 align:start position:0%
district but the school district is the
 
05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers correct y thank
 
05:34:55.310 --> 05:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
you represent Murray thank you madam
 
05:34:58.590 --> 05:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
chair I an additional question on page I
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
think this is one yeah um with regard to
 
05:35:05.590 --> 05:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh line 19 subsection and that defines
 
05:35:09.190 --> 05:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
nudity here um nothing talks about sort
 
05:35:13.628 --> 05:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
of science or um the process for which
 
05:35:16.548 --> 05:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
like you know um conversations with
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
communities who may not wear clothes or
 
05:35:19.920 --> 05:35:21.030 align:start position:0%
communities who may not wear clothes or
science

05:35:21.030 --> 05:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
science
 
05:35:23.990 --> 05:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
or biolog human biology so I'm curious
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
to know um you're you're simply defining
 
05:35:28.990 --> 05:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
nudity in
 
05:35:32.910 --> 05:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
a non like a non-educational context but
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
I I'm just unsure of like in a human
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
biology class if there were
 
05:35:37.638 --> 05:35:39.230 align:start position:0%
biology class if there were
conversations

05:35:39.230 --> 05:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
05:35:42.270 --> 05:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
about right would that violate this uh
 
05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
no no um I I I think that um you know
 
05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
these are all taken from um uh US
 
05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
Federal uh Court decisions um all these
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
definitions um and
 
05:36:01.390 --> 05:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
um I think one one of the cases might be
 
05:36:04.390 --> 05:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
gburg versus New York
 
05:36:08.430 --> 05:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
um um but uh yeah this is not uh in
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
um materials that are harmful to minors
 
05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
as uh um indicated elsewhere in the
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
statute in excuse me not statute but in
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation um I think that's on
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
page two uh page three excuse me no page
 
05:36:32.470 --> 05:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
wrong representative
 
05:36:37.350 --> 05:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you madam chair just a uh and
 
05:36:38.910 --> 05:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank if you take my question just a
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
followup to representative Murray's
 
05:36:42.430 --> 05:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
question like art classes you know
 
05:36:44.910 --> 05:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
statue of David I mean you can't do that
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
anymore uh no that is not the intent of
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
this I don't think that those um things
 
05:36:52.190 --> 05:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
like that would be uh indicated as uh
 
05:36:56.190 --> 05:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
harmful to minors per the uh legislation
 
05:36:59.670 --> 05:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
or and per um Court
 
05:37:02.990 --> 05:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
decisions representative dry thank you
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
05:37:08.030 --> 05:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
question reading a little further uh
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that something to in
 
05:37:14.190 --> 05:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
order to be declared harmful has to meet
 
05:37:19.948 --> 05:37:19.958 align:start position:0%
all four of the um per the
 
05:37:22.510 --> 05:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh the elements one two three and four
 
05:37:25.868 --> 05:37:25.878 align:start position:0%
on page two to be uh that includes
 
05:37:27.708 --> 05:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
nudity in one of them but not all four
 
05:37:32.310 --> 05:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
of them um to be declared obscene or
 
05:37:35.070 --> 05:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
harmful that is correct thank
 
05:37:38.190 --> 05:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Hall thank you madam
 
05:37:39.190 --> 05:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
question um my question is
 
05:37:46.548 --> 05:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
about um well this is about
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
minors and in our schools we have
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
students who are not
 
05:37:52.910 --> 05:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
minors um so what happens to their
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
access to materials does it is it in the
 
05:37:58.470 --> 05:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
library but only if you're not a minor
 
05:38:01.390 --> 05:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
um I I think that
 
05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
um uh I I assume that you're talking
 
05:38:06.948 --> 05:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
about at the high school level probably
 
05:38:12.830 --> 05:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and and um if that uh 18yearold or
 
05:38:12.840 --> 05:38:13.868 align:start position:0%
um and and um if that uh 18yearold or
19yearold

05:38:13.868 --> 05:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
19yearold
 
05:38:16.670 --> 05:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
um they would not be a minor so they
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
would not be covered under this um so
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
they would have access to
 
05:38:26.670 --> 05:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
materials um but um someone else who was
 
05:38:32.110 --> 05:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
16 or 17 years old could um uh complain
 
05:38:33.510 --> 05:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
about this or have their parents
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
complain about this uh material so if if
 
05:38:39.390 --> 05:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
um The
 
05:38:42.270 --> 05:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
Librarian um let's say there was a
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
complaint um by a 16-year-old's parents
 
05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the uh material was found to be uh
 
05:38:52.910 --> 05:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for that age group um then
 
05:38:56.350 --> 05:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
they should be uh I would imagine that U
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
it would be possible that the library
 
05:39:01.590 --> 05:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
would move that to a separate section um
 
05:39:04.390 --> 05:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
that would be available to um someone
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:08.798 --> 05:39:09.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:39:09.948 --> 05:39:09.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
represent representative
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:24.390 --> 05:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
um on page three uh line
 
05:39:28.110 --> 05:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
21 uh that's section seven there um it
 
05:39:30.708 --> 05:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
talks about the appealing to the State
 
05:39:31.670 --> 05:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
05:39:34.910 --> 05:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
Education um it says that an agrie
 
05:39:38.190 --> 05:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
parent of a grief parent I think it's
 
05:39:39.548 --> 05:39:39.558 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a grief parent or
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
Guardian may include a parent or
 
05:39:43.788 --> 05:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
Guardian who is not the original
 
05:39:45.868 --> 05:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
complaintant but one who is the parent
 
05:39:48.510 --> 05:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
or guardian of a student for whom access
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
to material is determined uh to be
 
05:39:54.750 --> 05:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
removed or restricted my question is as
 
05:39:57.150 --> 05:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
an example if somebody takes it all the
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
way up to the State Board of Education a
 
05:40:02.070 --> 05:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
particular book State Board of Education
 
05:40:04.390 --> 05:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
says this book is not appropriate for
 
05:40:08.270 --> 05:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
this age level does that mean that every
 
05:40:12.430 --> 05:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
school district has to um abide by that
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
decision um I would think certainly that
 
05:40:18.788 --> 05:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
that school district would and I would
 
05:40:23.190 --> 05:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
hope that um the uh state board or the
 
05:40:26.590 --> 05:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
department would um make uh make it
 
05:40:29.788 --> 05:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
known that um that
 
05:40:32.310 --> 05:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
material um was not appropriate for a
 
05:40:35.590 --> 05:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
certain age level to uh other schools as
 
05:40:35.600 --> 05:40:37.628 align:start position:0%
certain age level to uh other schools as
well

05:40:37.628 --> 05:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:40:39.510 --> 05:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
please um so if I'm understanding that
 
05:40:42.910 --> 05:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
correctly um somebody could say I took
 
05:40:44.548 --> 05:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
this appeal to the State Board of
 
05:40:48.190 --> 05:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
Education in my town Ry and they said it
 
05:40:49.948 --> 05:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't appropriate for the age level
 
05:40:51.670 --> 05:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
somebody could take that information and
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
then say okay I'm going over to Hampton
 
05:40:57.350 --> 05:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it's they've determined it it's not
 
05:40:59.670 --> 05:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate the State Board hasn't
 
05:41:01.788 --> 05:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
determined it's not appropriate for Ry
 
05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
they can do the same thing and so it
 
05:41:05.708 --> 05:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
would just kind of bounce around so that
 
05:41:08.350 --> 05:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
one book um that was challenged wouldn't
 
05:41:11.230 --> 05:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
be available Statewide I I think there
 
05:41:13.990 --> 05:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be um communities are
 
05:41:16.548 --> 05:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
different all right so I don't I think
 
05:41:19.468 --> 05:41:19.478 align:start position:0%
that the appeal process would go through
 
05:41:22.030 --> 05:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
um in that uh Hampton for instance that
 
05:41:25.910 --> 05:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:28.110 --> 05:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
well any other
 
05:41:45.468 --> 05:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:45.478 --> 05:41:56.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:41:56.110 --> 05:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:58.708 --> 05:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm going to put a three minute um
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
time limit on for the rest of the
 
05:42:10.510 --> 05:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you thanks for
 
05:42:15.670 --> 05:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
hearing from me again um a couple of
 
05:42:18.468 --> 05:42:18.478 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to bring up along with
 
05:42:18.478 --> 05:42:20.548 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to bring up along with
this

05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:42:22.830 --> 05:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
um I am in
 
05:42:25.350 --> 05:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
judiciary and um we have a bill that has
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
made it through J
 
05:42:31.628 --> 05:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and I think most parents and
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
most people are not aware that if your
 
05:42:37.990 --> 05:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
child minor takes a book out of the
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
library either at the
 
05:42:43.868 --> 05:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
school or at the public library you have
 
05:42:47.948 --> 05:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
a parent have no right to know what book
 
05:42:49.548 --> 05:42:49.558 align:start position:0%
they have taken
 
05:42:53.310 --> 05:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
out you don't have a right to know now
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
if you get a notice that the book is
 
05:42:59.628 --> 05:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
overdue and you owe money and you call
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
the school or the public
 
05:43:05.390 --> 05:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
library and ask well what book is
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
overdue they cannot take take tell you
 
05:43:10.468 --> 05:43:10.478 align:start position:0%
and I don't think people are aware of
 
05:43:11.788 --> 05:43:11.798 align:start position:0%
that but we have a bill that made it
 
05:43:15.628 --> 05:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
through Judiciary that will change
 
05:43:18.670 --> 05:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
that that's one thing the other thing
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
that came up that was very
 
05:43:23.708 --> 05:43:23.718 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching in judiciary is we have
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
a bill there that talks about children's
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
access to um a parents being able to put
 
05:43:33.548 --> 05:43:33.558 align:start position:0%
um filters on their children's phones
 
05:43:35.868 --> 05:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
and their eye and their iPhones and
 
05:43:39.150 --> 05:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
their iPads and those filters are there
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
but parents have to access them well we
 
05:43:45.310 --> 05:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
have a bill that says those those
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
filters will come on the phone for
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
Miners and parents will have to op out
 
05:43:54.628 --> 05:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
and the reason why that came was because
 
05:43:57.510 --> 05:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
of parents of children it's hard to
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
access to put those filters on to make
 
05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
it better for the parents and better for
 
05:44:06.390 --> 05:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
the children so that being said I think
 
05:44:10.750 --> 05:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
this is Comm sense um I cannot take a
 
05:44:15.310 --> 05:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
10-year-old to an X or an R-rated movie
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
I cannot take a 10-year-old into a store
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
to buy a
 
05:44:23.628 --> 05:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
Playboy when I watch TV in the evening
 
05:44:27.310 --> 05:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
it has things on it that say you know
 
05:44:30.590 --> 05:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
under 14 that type of thing there are
 
05:44:34.670 --> 05:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
video games that a 10-year-old cannot
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
access and cannot buy
 
05:44:42.750 --> 05:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
to have the things in the school that
 
05:44:45.948 --> 05:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
are being that are in the schools that
 
05:44:48.990 --> 05:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
children have access to and as we know
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
from last year everyone was horrified
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
when representative uh cordelli started
 
05:44:58.070 --> 05:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
to talk about them every stop stop you
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%

05:45:03.910 --> 05:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
things were available to Children these
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%

05:45:10.350 --> 05:45:10.360 align:start position:0%

05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
boy who was accessing oh sorry thank
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
you please vote for this protect the
 
05:45:33.948 --> 05:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:01.948 --> 05:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madame Vice chair
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
um um my name is jel bassinet I'm the
 
05:46:06.390 --> 05:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
legal director of the ACLU of New
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we're here in opposition
 
05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
to this legislation and I just want to
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
make a few brief points because I know I
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
have three minutes and and certainly
 
05:46:14.670 --> 05:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
want to be respectful of the committee's
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
time and the opportunity for those
 
05:46:21.548 --> 05:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
behind me to um uh speak on this bill uh
 
05:46:22.868 --> 05:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
the first point I want to make and it
 
05:46:24.990 --> 05:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
was referenced uh with respect to one of
 
05:46:27.628 --> 05:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
the questions is about what is the
 
05:46:29.468 --> 05:46:29.478 align:start position:0%
connection between this legislation and
 
05:46:31.590 --> 05:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
existing law and I did want to flag for
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
this committee that New Hampshire law
 
05:46:36.350 --> 05:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
already prevents giving miners quote
 
05:46:37.910 --> 05:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
harm from materials and I put that in
 
05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
quote because we have a separate statute
 
05:46:40.080 --> 05:46:40.990 align:start position:0%
quote because we have a separate statute
um

05:46:40.990 --> 05:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
571b that defines harmful materials and
 
05:46:46.468 --> 05:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
wholesale prohibits those dissemination
 
05:46:48.510 --> 05:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
that dissemination to minors both in the
 
05:46:50.468 --> 05:46:50.478 align:start position:0%
school and and outside of the school
 
05:46:53.230 --> 05:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
context and there's definitions baked
 
05:46:56.628 --> 05:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
within that statute that are designed to
 
05:46:58.548 --> 05:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
um codify and be consistent with the
 
05:47:00.510 --> 05:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional protections that we have
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
and the Constitutional standards that
 
05:47:04.350 --> 05:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
courts have articulated including the
 
05:47:06.270 --> 05:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg case that the sponsor
 
05:47:08.670 --> 05:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
articulated before so I just want to be
 
05:47:10.230 --> 05:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
be very clear about that and want to
 
05:47:13.230 --> 05:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to review um
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
that that statute because I do think in
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
light of that
 
05:47:19.910 --> 05:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
statute um this bill certainly in my
 
05:47:21.990 --> 05:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
brain kind of just presents some
 
05:47:24.510 --> 05:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
questions which is you know is the
 
05:47:26.510 --> 05:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
intent or does its
 
05:47:29.190 --> 05:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
scope um go or is it intended to go
 
05:47:31.670 --> 05:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
beyond what exists and existing law and
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
that actually would be concerning
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
because right the the existing law the
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
harmful material statute creates and
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
embodies constitutional standards and if
 
05:47:41.868 --> 05:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
we're trying to restrict materials
 
05:47:44.830 --> 05:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
beyond what exists in existing law and
 
05:47:46.150 --> 05:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
Beyond what exists in those
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional standards there could be
 
05:47:49.310 --> 05:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
serious constitutional concerns so I
 
05:47:51.628 --> 05:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
just wanted to flag that um for the
 
05:47:54.430 --> 05:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
committee um I do think again begs the
 
05:47:56.708 --> 05:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
question do we need this if we have
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
existing law um and I I certainly think
 
05:48:01.590 --> 05:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimate question with respect
 
05:48:01.600 --> 05:48:02.868 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimate question with respect
to

05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:48:05.150 --> 05:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
um what if anything is this intended to
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
do beyond the existing law so I'll leave
 
05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
it at that um but I do want to convey
 
05:48:11.070 --> 05:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
some of the Constitutional or some of
 
05:48:13.230 --> 05:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
the standards that are in this law and
 
05:48:14.948 --> 05:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
how they may not be fully consistent
 
05:48:17.430 --> 05:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
with constitutional principles um first
 
05:48:19.030 --> 05:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to talk um a little bit
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
about um the definitions in it including
 
05:48:24.350 --> 05:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
its expansiveness in so far as it
 
05:48:28.150 --> 05:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
encompasses nudity and sexual excitement
 
05:48:30.190 --> 05:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not entirely sure what ex sexual
 
05:48:34.110 --> 05:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
excitement means but in any event that
 
05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
exceeds uh sexual conduct sexual conduct
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
is the obscenity standard that is used
 
05:48:43.750 --> 05:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
um throughout the case law um it is the
 
05:48:45.948 --> 05:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
standard that's used in existing law in
 
05:48:47.670 --> 05:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the harmful material
 
05:48:49.510 --> 05:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
statute so I just wanted to point out to
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
the committee that this does go beyond
 
05:48:53.190 --> 05:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
that standard and that's just one of a
 
05:48:54.868 --> 05:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
couple examples of I think one of the
 
05:48:57.190 --> 05:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
the problems definitionally uh with this
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
law lastly I would want to talk about
 
05:49:00.510 --> 05:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education piece
 
05:49:01.948 --> 05:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
because I do think that's meaningful
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
typically when we think about obscenity
 
05:49:06.390 --> 05:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
we think about local standards state
 
05:49:08.468 --> 05:49:08.478 align:start position:0%
board is a state standard they're not
 
05:49:10.628 --> 05:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
elected and section one with respect to
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
obscenity I also think is um is
 
05:49:15.430 --> 05:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
problematic and what apply to private
 
05:49:16.830 --> 05:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
schools thank you I'm sorry for
 
05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
exceeding my
 
05:49:20.910 --> 05:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
time will take I had to rush of course
 
05:49:23.310 --> 05:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative drive thank
 
05:49:25.670 --> 05:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
you still have time to get to your sure
 
05:49:31.468 --> 05:49:31.478 align:start position:0%
okay um I understand that is already
 
05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
harmful um a crime to show this material
 
05:49:39.468 --> 05:49:39.478 align:start position:0%
to um minor but what we're talking about
 
05:49:43.708 --> 05:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
is um the immunity that educational
 
05:49:46.670 --> 05:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
institutions have from that law and I
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
think that K to 12 made up of minors for
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
the most part
 
05:49:56.548 --> 05:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
99% applies here so why do you have a
 
05:49:59.788 --> 05:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
problem with um with this with this bill
 
05:50:02.310 --> 05:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
going and taking away that immunity well
 
05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely sure that's um that's
 
05:50:07.150 --> 05:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
true with respect to 571b but I think
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
the point that I would make is that if
 
05:50:11.070 --> 05:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a standard that
 
05:50:13.468 --> 05:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
applies in the k312 context it needs to
 
05:50:15.468 --> 05:50:15.478 align:start position:0%
be fully consistent right with the
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
obscenity standard and so one example as
 
05:50:20.110 --> 05:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
I noted before this isn't limited to
 
05:50:22.590 --> 05:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
sexual conduct it in fact goes beyond
 
05:50:25.390 --> 05:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
that this is not fully consistent with
 
05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
the local um local community St
 
05:50:29.868 --> 05:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
Community standards because there is a
 
05:50:32.468 --> 05:50:32.478 align:start position:0%
state board of education component to it
 
05:50:33.990 --> 05:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the standard of review
 
05:50:35.628 --> 05:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
is for the State Board of Education are
 
05:50:37.310 --> 05:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
they looking at State stand standards
 
05:50:38.948 --> 05:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
local standards typically when we think
 
05:50:40.510 --> 05:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
about obscenity we think about local
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
standards because Community standards
 
05:50:44.670 --> 05:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
evolve and change that to me is not
 
05:50:46.910 --> 05:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
particularly clear in this legislation
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
especially given the fact that there're
 
05:50:50.270 --> 05:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
a state border view I would encourage
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
this committee to remove that because I
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
think that is that is
 
05:50:57.708 --> 05:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
problematic representative wuk thank you
 
05:51:00.350 --> 05:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
m chair good afternoon thank you Fork
 
05:51:02.948 --> 05:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
repres I'd like to go back to 571b
 
05:51:04.430 --> 05:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
because I AB I know absolutely nothing
 
05:51:08.510 --> 05:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
about it that um statute would that
 
05:51:10.110 --> 05:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
Encompass as
 
05:51:13.350 --> 05:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
well um private schools parochial
 
05:51:17.788 --> 05:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
schools any any school um including
 
05:51:20.910 --> 05:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
public or is that and I U because you're
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
talking about the New Hampshire statute
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and this bill deals with
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
specifically with K12 Public Schools it
 
05:51:30.590 --> 05:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
exempts parochial exempts charter
 
05:51:32.788 --> 05:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
exempts any of the schools so I'm trying
 
05:51:36.030 --> 05:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
to find out if 571 is there a conflict
 
05:51:38.868 --> 05:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
there or is cross over there I may I
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
think that's a great question I do want
 
05:51:42.830 --> 05:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
to check on that to confirm the
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
applicability of 571b to K through2 and
 
05:51:48.430 --> 05:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
higher education schools because I do
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
understand one of the intent behind this
 
05:51:52.708 --> 05:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
is to change the criminal obscenity law
 
05:51:56.548 --> 05:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
to kind of exclude k through2 um and it
 
05:51:59.230 --> 05:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
it does so not by amending 571b but by
 
05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
amending 654 the point why I want to
 
05:52:04.350 --> 05:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
make there with respect to that change
 
05:52:07.230 --> 05:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
in section one is that that that would I
 
05:52:09.708 --> 05:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
think include K through2 private schools
 
05:52:11.868 --> 05:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
too right because all you're doing there
 
05:52:14.910 --> 05:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
is calling out higher education um but
 
05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
with respect to whether 571b has an
 
05:52:20.910 --> 05:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
exemption for schools currently I want
 
05:52:22.708 --> 05:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
to just I want to check and I can get
 
05:52:24.430 --> 05:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
back to the committee on that I don't
 
05:52:26.110 --> 05:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
want to misstate anything with respect
 
05:52:29.150 --> 05:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
to its application thank you thank you m
 
05:52:31.708 --> 05:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
chair any other
 
05:52:34.150 --> 05:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:52:36.510 --> 05:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
kuger thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:52:38.868 --> 05:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you um I
 
05:52:41.430 --> 05:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify with you where it
 
05:52:44.590 --> 05:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
says second on page two that school
 
05:52:46.868 --> 05:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
districts would are required to have 14
 
05:52:49.548 --> 05:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
days of notice for curriculum course
 
05:52:52.468 --> 05:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
material so I'm making an assumption
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
here that this would not include
 
05:52:57.468 --> 05:52:57.478 align:start position:0%
textbooks that are used for example for
 
05:52:59.830 --> 05:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
health class related
 
05:53:02.590 --> 05:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
purposes am I reading that
 
05:53:05.708 --> 05:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
correctly it it depends on whether
 
05:53:08.468 --> 05:53:08.478 align:start position:0%
someone use the contents of those
 
05:53:11.150 --> 05:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
materials as feeding as satisfying the
 
05:53:13.548 --> 05:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
definitions so that might be the intent
 
05:53:15.390 --> 05:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
and if that is the intent to exclude
 
05:53:18.548 --> 05:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
that I would certainly be clear um clear
 
05:53:22.150 --> 05:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislation followup sure um because it
 
05:53:27.548 --> 05:53:27.558 align:start position:0%
also mentions here that school boards
 
05:53:29.110 --> 05:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
are required to require that their
 
05:53:30.788 --> 05:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
schools provide developmentally
 
05:53:33.150 --> 05:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate collection of instructional
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
resources so I'm assuming that that
 
05:53:37.868 --> 05:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
protects textbooks in that
 
05:53:41.430 --> 05:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
sense I I hope so I think the I think
 
05:53:44.190 --> 05:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's the question right is you know do
 
05:53:46.830 --> 05:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
these four elements the standards
 
05:53:49.628 --> 05:53:49.638 align:start position:0%
articulated in this bill provide
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
protections for that material or is the
 
05:53:55.350 --> 05:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
wording here problematic to the extent
 
05:53:57.190 --> 05:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
that it could be argued that it's not
 
05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
covered and that's why Clarity here is
 
05:54:02.350 --> 05:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
so clear and why making sure that these
 
05:54:04.868 --> 05:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
standards modify to the letter the
 
05:54:06.628 --> 05:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
Constitutional standards is so important
 
05:54:09.510 --> 05:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
so for example you know nudity should
 
05:54:10.670 --> 05:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
that should not be the standard it
 
05:54:12.868 --> 05:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
should be like consistent with current
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
law right it should be sexual conduct
 
05:54:17.788 --> 05:54:17.798 align:start position:0%
that's one way to try to make this clear
 
05:54:19.948 --> 05:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
to prevent that type of interpretation
 
05:54:21.868 --> 05:54:21.878 align:start position:0%
and so we're more consistent with the
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
Constitutional standards that exist
 
05:54:24.240 --> 05:54:25.310 align:start position:0%
Constitutional standards that exist
thank

05:54:25.310 --> 05:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:54:28.510 --> 05:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray thank you um
 
05:54:29.948 --> 05:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
question so with regard to higher ed
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
institutions um do we see that there are
 
05:54:37.830 --> 05:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
potential some issues around the
 
05:54:41.270 --> 05:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of uh challenging
 
05:54:44.590 --> 05:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
materials at an institution of higher
 
05:54:47.468 --> 05:54:47.478 align:start position:0%
ed I so now I think you're referring to
 
05:54:51.070 --> 05:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
part one which kind of is
 
05:54:53.350 --> 05:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
um I think that's I think that's a good
 
05:54:54.910 --> 05:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
question I do think it seems like what
 
05:54:56.430 --> 05:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
part one is designed to do is is
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
maintain the protections that exist
 
05:55:00.110 --> 05:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
under the criminal obscenity statute for
 
05:55:02.030 --> 05:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
highed so I want to just kind of
 
05:55:03.708 --> 05:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
recognize that that I think is what the
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
intent is and and I think the purpose is
 
05:55:08.590 --> 05:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
to limit that current exemption under
 
05:55:11.310 --> 05:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
criminal obscenity law to the K through2
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
context I do think right when you when
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
you start engaging in um restrictions
 
05:55:18.468 --> 05:55:18.478 align:start position:0%
certainly above the K through2 context
 
05:55:20.670 --> 05:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
but I don't think is the intent here um
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
certainly the Constitutional standards
 
05:55:25.230 --> 05:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
change right and and the standards you
 
05:55:27.830 --> 05:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
know change um so I'll just leave it at
 
05:55:31.708 --> 05:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
that thank you any other questions
 
05:55:33.190 --> 05:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you madam
 
05:55:33.990 --> 05:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for the
 
05:55:35.590 --> 05:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
accommodation I really appreciate it
 
05:55:37.708 --> 05:55:37.718 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
05:55:37.718 --> 05:55:45.750 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
representative

05:55:45.750 --> 05:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:48.788 --> 05:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
coren good afternoon my name is Lori
 
05:55:51.070 --> 05:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
coren I am State Rep from Coos district
 
05:55:53.670 --> 05:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
7 um I just wanted to talk about a
 
05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
couple things
 
05:55:59.150 --> 05:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
um when we when we send our kids to K
 
05:56:01.510 --> 05:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
through 12 to the public school those
 
05:56:03.948 --> 05:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
kids don't have a choice most of the
 
05:56:07.270 --> 05:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
time um so we need to out of our way to
 
05:56:09.110 --> 05:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that families are are okay
 
05:56:11.628 --> 05:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:56:15.708 --> 05:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
um my I've done Foster and adoptive care
 
05:56:18.750 --> 05:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
for 20 years well 15 in mass and then
 
05:56:23.708 --> 05:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
some here um books that this bill wishes
 
05:56:23.718 --> 05:56:25.910 align:start position:0%
some here um books that this bill wishes
to

05:56:25.910 --> 05:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:56:29.350 --> 05:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
address have really triggering effects
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
on some of the kids and Foster and
 
05:56:34.830 --> 05:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
adoptive care um the last I checked
 
05:56:37.150 --> 05:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
three in one females were sexually
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
abused in New Hampshire I think it was
 
05:56:43.468 --> 05:56:43.478 align:start position:0%
five no three out of five uh one out of
 
05:56:45.788 --> 05:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
five boys are sexually
 
05:56:48.468 --> 05:56:48.478 align:start position:0%
abused when a parent sends their kids to
 
05:56:51.270 --> 05:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
to public school they want to know that
 
05:56:53.190 --> 05:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
when their kids are are in a public
 
05:56:55.948 --> 05:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
library they're safe they're not looking
 
05:56:57.750 --> 05:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
at things that are going to be
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
triggering um this happened to one of my
 
05:57:00.718 --> 05:57:04.150 align:start position:0%
triggering um this happened to one of my
sons

05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:06.628 --> 05:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
um we need to be careful of what we're
 
05:57:08.910 --> 05:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
putting in our Public Schools our
 
05:57:10.590 --> 05:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
numbers are
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
dropping we need to reach out and make
 
05:57:14.990 --> 05:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
sure these parents know that public
 
05:57:19.670 --> 05:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:21.708 --> 05:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
to I
 
05:57:25.948 --> 05:57:25.958 align:start position:0%
just we need legislation like
 
05:57:28.590 --> 05:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
this thank you any
 
05:57:34.830 --> 05:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:29.190 --> 05:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:31.430 --> 05:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
sorry these are from books which are in
 
05:58:33.548 --> 05:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
our libraries I thought they were just
 
05:58:35.548 --> 05:58:35.558 align:start position:0%
in our middle schools when I passed
 
05:58:38.030 --> 05:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
these out last year one of the Reps said
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
oh this is in our elementary school so
 
05:58:44.390 --> 05:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
you might read this as even less than 10
 
05:58:46.430 --> 05:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
years old
 
05:58:48.910 --> 05:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
um we're not talking about whether or
 
05:58:51.070 --> 05:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
not these are good books or not good
 
05:58:54.390 --> 05:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
books in fact the first one on here
 
05:58:57.590 --> 05:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
flamer is actually a pretty good book
 
05:59:00.590 --> 05:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
for high school boys it would be a
 
05:59:04.150 --> 05:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
terrible Book for a 10-year-old we don't
 
05:59:06.670 --> 05:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
need our 10-year-olds wondering
 
05:59:09.070 --> 05:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
if when they go to boy scout camp in the
 
05:59:11.708 --> 05:59:11.718 align:start position:0%
summer if they're going to have to uh
 
05:59:14.708 --> 05:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
come in a bottle or if they should be
 
05:59:17.628 --> 05:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
considering suicide which are topics in
 
05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
that book and it's a well-written book
 
05:59:25.868 --> 05:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
it says it's a graphic novel it says the
 
05:59:29.628 --> 05:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
reading level is two second grade but it
 
05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
says the attend intended audience is 9th
 
05:59:35.510 --> 05:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
through 12th grade not 9th through 12
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
years old
 
05:59:40.590 --> 05:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
9th through 12th grade and yet it is in
 
05:59:42.548 --> 05:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
at least one of our elementary schools
 
05:59:45.070 --> 05:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
and many of our middle schools the
 
05:59:48.468 --> 05:59:48.478 align:start position:0%
bottom one gender queer which does have
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
sexual activity in it for the definition
 
05:59:53.830 --> 05:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
one of the previous speakers mentioned
 
05:59:55.708 --> 05:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
it's written for
 
05:59:58.230 --> 05:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
adults not
 
06:00:00.948 --> 06:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
10-year-olds and the problem is these
 
06:00:03.030 --> 06:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
images you can't get them out of your
 
06:00:05.468 --> 06:00:05.478 align:start position:0%
head once you've seen them and I'm sorry
 
06:00:07.150 --> 06:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
I passed them around for you to see them
 
06:00:09.670 --> 06:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
but I want you to see and understand
 
06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
these are not the worst images out there
 
06:00:14.788 --> 06:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
these are just ones I was willing to
 
06:00:18.670 --> 06:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
print they get worse
 
06:00:21.190 --> 06:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
um this is I'm trying to think of
 
06:00:22.948 --> 06:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
arguments people have had in the past
 
06:00:24.430 --> 06:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
this is not an
 
06:00:27.948 --> 06:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
anti-homosexuality bill I have numerous
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
homosexual friends good friends and they
 
06:00:34.670 --> 06:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
have written many times um gays against
 
06:00:36.830 --> 06:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
groomers and leav our children be
 
06:00:39.150 --> 06:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
innocent for as long as possible and
 
06:00:41.510 --> 06:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
they very much object to this material
 
06:00:43.830 --> 06:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
being in our schools and our young
 
06:00:46.110 --> 06:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
children seeing this
 
06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
material and you may say well parents
 
06:00:52.350 --> 06:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
can just you know go in and look well no
 
06:00:54.590 --> 06:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
some school districts yes some school
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
districts no and I know of one we had
 
06:00:59.788 --> 06:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
testimony of a dad who looked at the
 
06:01:03.030 --> 06:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
quote unquote card Catalog online and
 
06:01:04.750 --> 06:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
was relieved to find that his school
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have any of these books books and
 
06:01:08.590 --> 06:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
then he went in to pick up his kid
 
06:01:10.190 --> 06:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
partway through school for a doctor's
 
06:01:12.868 --> 06:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
appointment or something and uh pop by
 
06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
the library on the way no they weren't
 
06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
online listed they were on full display
 
06:01:21.628 --> 06:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
as you enter the library as recommended
 
06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
reading that Dad took his kid out and
 
06:01:28.948 --> 06:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
never brought him back and this is
 
06:01:31.830 --> 06:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
mild sorry I could tell you what it was
 
06:01:33.270 --> 06:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
compared to and I could tell you what
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
state law for libraries is
 
06:01:39.670 --> 06:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
06:01:42.390 --> 06:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you oh
 
06:01:44.750 --> 06:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
represent withfield
 
06:01:47.390 --> 06:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
question what what is the state law for
 
06:01:51.868 --> 06:01:51.878 align:start position:0%
the public libraries well it it's
 
06:01:53.788 --> 06:01:53.798 align:start position:0%
Federal actually and then it comes down
 
06:01:57.230 --> 06:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
to the State library and it talks about
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
not just sexual
 
06:02:03.390 --> 06:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
acts it um it includes a vast variety of
 
06:02:06.270 --> 06:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
things including books which are spefic
 
06:02:09.310 --> 06:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
specifically to arouse Etc I mean it's
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's along and I know that rep cordelli
 
06:02:15.270 --> 06:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
has a copy of it I did not bring that
 
06:02:18.830 --> 06:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
today but I can send it if you need um
 
06:02:21.190 --> 06:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
and according to it none of these books
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be allowed and the instructions
 
06:02:25.350 --> 06:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
are if the State Library gives funding
 
06:02:28.468 --> 06:02:28.478 align:start position:0%
to any Library which has this type of
 
06:02:31.350 --> 06:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
material then I mean if they give
 
06:02:33.350 --> 06:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
funding and then that library is found
 
06:02:34.830 --> 06:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
to have this type of material they have
 
06:02:39.030 --> 06:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
to cut off funding for a few years so I
 
06:02:41.110 --> 06:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if our State Library gives
 
06:02:43.868 --> 06:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
any funding to our school libraries but
 
06:02:47.150 --> 06:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
if they did they would be in
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
trouble thank you any other
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions per of
 
06:02:56.350 --> 06:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
NATO thank you madam chair
 
06:02:59.628 --> 06:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
um the gentleman from the ACLU stated
 
06:03:06.868 --> 06:03:06.878 align:start position:0%
RSA 571 DB and it does
 
06:03:08.350 --> 06:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:03:11.868 --> 06:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
specifically State some restrictions do
 
06:03:14.788 --> 06:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
you firmly believe that the the law
 
06:03:17.390 --> 06:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
before us the bill before us will expand
 
06:03:21.788 --> 06:03:21.798 align:start position:0%
on that and protect the children in the
 
06:03:24.628 --> 06:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
libraries I think
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
um if I recall this bill was written
 
06:03:30.830 --> 06:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
partly towards the laws for libraries
 
06:03:33.868 --> 06:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
specifically which is federal which goes
 
06:03:36.270 --> 06:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the um
 
06:03:39.510 --> 06:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
RSA that was stated there and and we
 
06:03:41.230 --> 06:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
follow those
 
06:03:44.670 --> 06:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines laws thank you and
 
06:03:47.070 --> 06:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming before
 
06:03:49.830 --> 06:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
us any other
 
06:03:53.510 --> 06:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none oh one more
 
06:03:55.430 --> 06:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell I just I wanted to
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
clarify I'm sorry that the State Library
 
06:03:59.110 --> 06:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
does not give any money to the school
 
06:04:03.670 --> 06:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
libraries that's cool I'm glad um
 
06:04:06.310 --> 06:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
and I personally have happen to think
 
06:04:07.910 --> 06:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the school libraries would should
 
06:04:09.948 --> 06:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
follow the same rules the State library
 
06:04:12.948 --> 06:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
has to but thank
 
06:04:17.390 --> 06:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:27.670 --> 06:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
Benson good afternoon I have some
 
06:04:29.788 --> 06:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I will hand out
 
06:04:42.350 --> 06:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh Jacqueline Benson I am an author and
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
a regional leader for authors against
 
06:04:48.910 --> 06:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
book bands we are Coalition of writers
 
06:04:51.190 --> 06:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
illustrators and editors that oppose
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional efforts to limit the
 
06:04:55.670 --> 06:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
freedom to read and I'm here today to
 
06:04:59.468 --> 06:04:59.478 align:start position:0%
share some concerns about HB 324 as it's
 
06:05:01.830 --> 06:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
currently written um I'd like to point
 
06:05:04.350 --> 06:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
out that there is no existing definitive
 
06:05:06.548 --> 06:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
list of which book books that have been
 
06:05:08.750 --> 06:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
published in the United States meet the
 
06:05:11.948 --> 06:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
legal definition of obscenity so
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
determining whether a challenged book is
 
06:05:16.270 --> 06:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
puant or patently offensive or lacking
 
06:05:18.670 --> 06:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
in literary value to use some of the
 
06:05:21.548 --> 06:05:21.558 align:start position:0%
language from HB 324 is always going to
 
06:05:25.150 --> 06:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
come down to a judgment call and if we
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
look at how those judgment calls are
 
06:05:29.030 --> 06:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
being made around the United States
 
06:05:31.390 --> 06:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
right now you can see that among the
 
06:05:34.070 --> 06:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
most banned authors in last year's
 
06:05:37.110 --> 06:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
record-breaking 10,000 plus School
 
06:05:40.510 --> 06:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
library book bands were Margaret Atwood
 
06:05:44.788 --> 06:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
Tony Morrison Ked heni Stephen King and
 
06:05:46.110 --> 06:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's difficult to argue that
 
06:05:48.468 --> 06:05:48.478 align:start position:0%
titles like The Bluest Eye or the
 
06:05:50.708 --> 06:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
handmaid's tale which are among the most
 
06:05:52.628 --> 06:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
influential books published in the 20th
 
06:05:55.070 --> 06:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
century are pornographic and lack
 
06:05:59.430 --> 06:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
literary merit so why are they being
 
06:06:02.830 --> 06:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
banned because too often the Judgment
 
06:06:04.750 --> 06:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
call about a book's appropriateness or
 
06:06:07.070 --> 06:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
Merit is being made by a single
 
06:06:09.590 --> 06:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
individual or body in a process that
 
06:06:13.548 --> 06:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
excludes other voices a more robust and
 
06:06:17.110 --> 06:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh policy would see Parental
 
06:06:19.708 --> 06:06:19.718 align:start position:0%
challenges reviewed by an informed group
 
06:06:19.718 --> 06:06:20.430 align:start position:0%
challenges reviewed by an informed group
of

06:06:20.430 --> 06:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that should include School
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
administrators but also Librarians
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
school media Specialists teachers school
 
06:06:29.708 --> 06:06:29.718 align:start position:0%
board members and other parents from the
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
community who are also impacted by these
 
06:06:32.400 --> 06:06:33.270 align:start position:0%
community who are also impacted by these
book

06:06:33.270 --> 06:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
book
 
06:06:35.590 --> 06:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
removals uh and in fact a stakeholder
 
06:06:37.190 --> 06:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
based approach is probably a legal
 
06:06:39.548 --> 06:06:39.558 align:start position:0%
necessity right now six major book
 
06:06:40.948 --> 06:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
publishers and several best-selling
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
authors are suing the state of Florida
 
06:06:45.510 --> 06:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
over a law very similar to this one as a
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
violation of constitutional Free Speech
 
06:06:49.390 --> 06:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
rights and that suit was recently
 
06:06:51.868 --> 06:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
greenlighted by a Flor Florida federal
 
06:06:53.948 --> 06:06:53.958 align:start position:0%
court judge who called the state's
 
06:06:53.958 --> 06:06:55.628 align:start position:0%
court judge who called the state's
approach

06:06:55.628 --> 06:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
approach
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
capricious uh so in conclusion policies
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
related to the removal of material from
 
06:07:02.510 --> 06:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
school libraries need to balance the
 
06:07:04.510 --> 06:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns of individual
 
06:07:07.230 --> 06:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
parents against the constitutional
 
06:07:09.310 --> 06:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
rights of other students and parents in
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
the community and I would therefore urge
 
06:07:13.548 --> 06:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
the committee if they are looking at
 
06:07:15.628 --> 06:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
establishing a precedent for this sort
 
06:07:17.708 --> 06:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
of policy to make sure that it is a
 
06:07:20.030 --> 06:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and inclusive one that brings
 
06:07:21.910 --> 06:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
all the key stakeholders including
 
06:07:24.150 --> 06:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
Librarians themselves were the ones
 
06:07:26.350 --> 06:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
trained to assess the value of this
 
06:07:30.150 --> 06:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
material to the table any
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative dry
 
06:07:34.030 --> 06:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
question I've always determined that
 
06:07:39.270 --> 06:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
band book was one that no one could get
 
06:07:42.030 --> 06:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
a hold of is that what applies to these
 
06:07:43.788 --> 06:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
that you're calling band books I don't
 
06:07:45.670 --> 06:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
think there's necessarily one single
 
06:07:48.070 --> 06:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
definition for band book as the authors
 
06:07:49.868 --> 06:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
against book bands looks at it if a book
 
06:07:53.230 --> 06:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
is removed from a library and it is no
 
06:07:55.270 --> 06:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
longer available to students to read
 
06:07:58.230 --> 06:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
there we would call that band for those
 
06:07:59.468 --> 06:07:59.478 align:start position:0%
students they would no longer have
 
06:08:01.350 --> 06:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
access to that
 
06:08:04.430 --> 06:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
book says 2025 there's lots of ways to
 
06:08:06.350 --> 06:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
get access to books side your local
 
06:08:08.990 --> 06:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
library there are if you can afford them
 
06:08:10.548 --> 06:08:10.558 align:start position:0%
if you have access if you have
 
06:08:12.910 --> 06:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
transportation if you have a budget part
 
06:08:14.830 --> 06:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the foundation of our libraries in
 
06:08:17.070 --> 06:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
this country was to ensure that access
 
06:08:19.468 --> 06:08:19.478 align:start position:0%
to information was free and available to
 
06:08:22.350 --> 06:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.070 --> 06:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
communities representative Lichfield
 
06:08:26.830 --> 06:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
06:08:29.548 --> 06:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um throwing this
 
06:08:31.030 --> 06:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
at you probably not fair but because
 
06:08:33.788 --> 06:08:33.798 align:start position:0%
you're an author um we had someone else
 
06:08:36.670 --> 06:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
that had testified how there are ratings
 
06:08:39.030 --> 06:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
on video games there are ratings on
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
movies even when you go to let's say a g
 
06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
movie they might kind of pair down the
 
06:08:46.990 --> 06:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
um the highlights or previews of other
 
06:08:49.670 --> 06:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
movies to be more age appropriate why
 
06:08:51.270 --> 06:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't they do this for
 
06:08:54.190 --> 06:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
books it's a good question I don't have
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
an answer for that I know as an author
 
06:08:58.910 --> 06:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
myself I voluntarily put a Content
 
06:09:00.670 --> 06:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
warning at the front of my own books
 
06:09:03.070 --> 06:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
that details any content people might
 
06:09:04.390 --> 06:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
find challenging or triggering or
 
06:09:05.670 --> 06:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
objectionable in the books so they can
 
06:09:07.190 --> 06:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
make a conscious decision about reading
 
06:09:10.030 --> 06:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
it but there isn't an industry standard
 
06:09:11.788 --> 06:09:11.798 align:start position:0%
or a law that requires that kind of
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
rating process um I can't answer for you
 
06:09:18.390 --> 06:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
why they haven't done that thank you
 
06:09:20.510 --> 06:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
06:09:28.110 --> 06:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:51.030 --> 06:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:52.590 --> 06:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
thank you the committee and the the
 
06:09:54.868 --> 06:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
chairwoman for hearing me speak today
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's my first time testifying so please
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
excuse any uh ums or nervous hands um my
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
name is Katherine gatam I am a resident
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
of Gerome I have a master's degree in
 
06:10:09.150 --> 06:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
library and information science and I am
 
06:10:13.430 --> 06:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
also a parent um I would urge this
 
06:10:15.190 --> 06:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
committee to vote in expedient to
 
06:10:19.070 --> 06:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
legislate on this bill as we have heard
 
06:10:21.830 --> 06:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
and seen this bill is being introduced
 
06:10:24.430 --> 06:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
as a way to protect children but what we
 
06:10:27.150 --> 06:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
have seen in other states with similar
 
06:10:30.190 --> 06:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
legislation is that this bill is
 
06:10:32.350 --> 06:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
censoring materials for children who may
 
06:10:35.350 --> 06:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
need the most uh pen America is
 
06:10:37.750 --> 06:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
organization who tracks uh book
 
06:10:39.350 --> 06:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
challenges across the country it was
 
06:10:41.030 --> 06:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
just mentioned there were over 10,000
 
06:10:44.310 --> 06:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
last year this was a uh 200% increase in
 
06:10:47.070 --> 06:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
those challenges only 133% of them
 
06:10:50.468 --> 06:10:50.478 align:start position:0%
showed sex on the page uh this could be
 
06:10:52.270 --> 06:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
uh a book written for teenagers it could
 
06:10:55.430 --> 06:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
be uh a sex education book uh but the
 
06:10:57.708 --> 06:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
majority of these titles are not uh that
 
06:11:00.270 --> 06:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
are that are objected to are not
 
06:11:01.788 --> 06:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
actually showing sex on the page so I
 
06:11:03.750 --> 06:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
think that's important uh to keep in
 
06:11:05.430 --> 06:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
mind when we say obene you know what
 
06:11:07.270 --> 06:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
does that what does that really mean and
 
06:11:09.468 --> 06:11:09.478 align:start position:0%
what it often becomes is books that are
 
06:11:12.868 --> 06:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
targeting lgbtqia plus characters and it
 
06:11:15.788 --> 06:11:15.798 align:start position:0%
is so important for children to see
 
06:11:17.708 --> 06:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
themselves in the books that they read
 
06:11:19.548 --> 06:11:19.558 align:start position:0%
books should be a mirror to your own
 
06:11:21.830 --> 06:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
experience you know children and teens
 
06:11:23.390 --> 06:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
they're still learning about themselves
 
06:11:25.430 --> 06:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
their identity it is validating to see
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
themselves in the books they read and
 
06:11:30.270 --> 06:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
books also can be a window into the
 
06:11:32.270 --> 06:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
world around you uh so children and
 
06:11:34.468 --> 06:11:34.478 align:start position:0%
teens they are learning empathy they are
 
06:11:35.990 --> 06:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
learning about the world around them and
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
we need to give them uh the resources to
 
06:11:40.830 --> 06:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
do so um as a librarian you know I've
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
talked to families children teens given
 
06:11:46.190 --> 06:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
them those resources and I think for
 
06:11:48.150 --> 06:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
many kids the school library is a
 
06:11:50.628 --> 06:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
lifeline and and books can really save
 
06:11:53.830 --> 06:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
their lives um as a librarian we follow
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
collection development policies we read
 
06:11:58.230 --> 06:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
professional reviews and we are trying
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
to ensure that our collections are both
 
06:12:02.910 --> 06:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
age appropriate and relevant to the
 
06:12:05.390 --> 06:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
communities that we serve um it is
 
06:12:07.390 --> 06:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
absurd to think that any librarian at
 
06:12:08.990 --> 06:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
least any librarian I know or have had
 
06:12:10.910 --> 06:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of working with is out to
 
06:12:12.788 --> 06:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
harm children with the materials that we
 
06:12:16.788 --> 06:12:16.798 align:start position:0%
are providing to them in schools um I
 
06:12:19.030 --> 06:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
think as a parent certainly we have the
 
06:12:21.868 --> 06:12:21.878 align:start position:0%
right to guide our children in what they
 
06:12:24.468 --> 06:12:24.478 align:start position:0%
are reading and consuming but it is not
 
06:12:26.510 --> 06:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
right for one parent to dictate what an
 
06:12:29.990 --> 06:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
entire school district is able to access
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
um so with that being said I I urge you
 
06:12:35.548 --> 06:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
all to vote in expedient to legislate on
 
06:12:37.070 --> 06:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank
 
06:12:39.788 --> 06:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative dve thank
 
06:12:41.990 --> 06:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for taking my question
 
06:12:43.510 --> 06:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'm GNA ask the same question here you
 
06:12:45.628 --> 06:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
say it's AES represents a clear
 
06:12:47.590 --> 06:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
attempted book Banning and do you
 
06:12:49.948 --> 06:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
consider Banning just that some people
 
06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
can't do it or just that no one could
 
06:12:53.548 --> 06:12:53.558 align:start position:0%
get it yeah I think I would Echo the
 
06:12:55.110 --> 06:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
sentiments that were just shared that
 
06:12:56.910 --> 06:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
when we use the book term book ban and
 
06:12:58.910 --> 06:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a divisive term that that
 
06:13:01.270 --> 06:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
should be considered to say something
 
06:13:03.190 --> 06:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
else it's a it's attempted censorship we
 
06:13:05.350 --> 06:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
are Banning a child in that school
 
06:13:07.548 --> 06:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
access to that book that child can no
 
06:13:09.830 --> 06:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
longer access that book in the school so
 
06:13:12.030 --> 06:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
in that sense I would say yes this is a
 
06:13:14.910 --> 06:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
a book ban thank
 
06:13:16.750 --> 06:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you and thank you for taking
 
06:13:20.430 --> 06:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
my question so earli in your testimony
 
06:13:22.150 --> 06:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
you testified about uh certain children
 
06:13:23.548 --> 06:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
needing to be able to see certain
 
06:13:26.070 --> 06:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
material I'm looking at a picture from a
 
06:13:27.830 --> 06:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
book gender queer where there's a male
 
06:13:30.350 --> 06:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
providing oral sex on another male and
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering who who in their
 
06:13:33.468 --> 06:13:33.478 align:start position:0%
right mind would need to see something
 
06:13:36.830 --> 06:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
like this at an age such as 10 years old
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
um to that specific book I would say
 
06:13:43.070 --> 06:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
that book is an adult title um and I
 
06:13:45.390 --> 06:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
think that as I mentioned as Librarians
 
06:13:47.190 --> 06:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
we have collection development policies
 
06:13:50.070 --> 06:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
that clearly State uh you know we look
 
06:13:51.430 --> 06:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
at professional reviews that book has
 
06:13:53.628 --> 06:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
been reviewed for adults it has won
 
06:13:57.110 --> 06:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
awards um and so yeah this is a a
 
06:14:01.230 --> 06:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
renowned title um for adults and I think
 
06:14:02.430 --> 06:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
to answer your question should a
 
06:14:03.948 --> 06:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
10-year-old read that book that book is
 
06:14:06.510 --> 06:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
not written for 10-year-olds um so I I
 
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
think that's how I would respond to your
 
06:14:09.310 --> 06:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
06:14:12.670 --> 06:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
you followup so I take your answer to
 
06:14:15.150 --> 06:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
that is 10-year-old should not be seeing
 
06:14:15.160 --> 06:14:16.190 align:start position:0%
that is 10-year-old should not be seeing
that

06:14:16.190 --> 06:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:14:19.270 --> 06:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
material I am saying that Librarians
 
06:14:20.750 --> 06:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
follow collection development policy
 
06:14:22.230 --> 06:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
gender queer is a book written for
 
06:14:25.670 --> 06:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
adults and it it is as a librarian in my
 
06:14:27.948 --> 06:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
library um I did not have that book in
 
06:14:29.628 --> 06:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
my teen section of the public library
 
06:14:31.350 --> 06:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
that is in the adult
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
section I clarifies thank you
 
06:14:38.110 --> 06:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
L Lichfield thank you madam chair and
 
06:14:39.830 --> 06:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
06:14:39.840 --> 06:14:41.670 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
question

06:14:41.670 --> 06:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:14:43.788 --> 06:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
so if I heard you correctly you
 
06:14:47.110 --> 06:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that 133% of the 10,000 books
 
06:14:50.190 --> 06:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
were found sexually explicit do you
 
06:14:53.350 --> 06:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
realize that that IS300 books that's and
 
06:14:55.430 --> 06:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
my question is what is the organization
 
06:14:56.628 --> 06:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed it yeah the
 
06:14:58.830 --> 06:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
organization is pen America could you
 
06:15:02.190 --> 06:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
spell just pan it's pen pen America and
 
06:15:04.230 --> 06:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
again that also included books uh about
 
06:15:08.230 --> 06:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
sexed um stories I mean teenagers need
 
06:15:12.510 --> 06:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
to see their experiences on the page um
 
06:15:14.628 --> 06:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
teenagers are may be sexually active and
 
06:15:16.670 --> 06:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
this could this is a safe way for them
 
06:15:20.628 --> 06:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
to understand their bodies um again I
 
06:15:22.468 --> 06:15:22.478 align:start position:0%
think it's all about that that
 
06:15:23.948 --> 06:15:23.958 align:start position:0%
professional discretion of the librarian
 
06:15:26.070 --> 06:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
this book is written for teens I'm not
 
06:15:28.590 --> 06:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we put this in the hands
 
06:15:29.868 --> 06:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
of a first
 
06:15:29.878 --> 06:15:32.190 align:start position:0%
of a first
grader

06:15:32.190 --> 06:15:32.200 align:start position:0%
grader
 
06:15:34.468 --> 06:15:34.478 align:start position:0%
just thank you and thank you for taking
 
06:15:37.110 --> 06:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
my question M but are you putting the
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
opinion of the librarian over the
 
06:15:40.548 --> 06:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
opinion of the parent oh certainly not
 
06:15:42.390 --> 06:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
as a parent as I said I believe that
 
06:15:46.390 --> 06:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
parents have the right to to decide what
 
06:15:49.548 --> 06:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
a child is is reading um if I don't want
 
06:15:51.948 --> 06:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
my child reading that book then I will
 
06:15:54.468 --> 06:15:54.478 align:start position:0%
not allow them to to read the book but
 
06:15:54.478 --> 06:15:56.430 align:start position:0%
not allow them to to read the book but
it's

06:15:56.430 --> 06:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:15:59.708 --> 06:15:59.718 align:start position:0%
available yeah
 
06:16:02.510 --> 06:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
Rel one more question I'm sorry thank
 
06:16:06.270 --> 06:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
you but I we heard earlier today that
 
06:16:08.310 --> 06:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
actually I was a co-sponsor on that bill
 
06:16:10.990 --> 06:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
that the parents do not have access to
 
06:16:12.430 --> 06:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
what the children are taking out of the
 
06:16:15.590 --> 06:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
library so how would the parent know I
 
06:16:17.990 --> 06:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
think it's about communication I cannot
 
06:16:19.510 --> 06:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
speak for every parent in their
 
06:16:20.990 --> 06:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
relationship that they have with their
 
06:16:26.110 --> 06:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
child um and I think I what I will say
 
06:16:27.788 --> 06:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
is that we need to rely on the
 
06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
professionals to to look at these
 
06:16:33.788 --> 06:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
resources and review them um and not one
 
06:16:36.468 --> 06:16:36.478 align:start position:0%
parent should be able to take a book
 
06:16:38.708 --> 06:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
away from an entire group of
 
06:16:41.830 --> 06:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
people representative Bon thank you
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
madam shair and thank you for taking my
 
06:16:44.830 --> 06:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
question it goes along with what you've
 
06:16:47.110 --> 06:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
been talking about as a school librarian
 
06:16:50.868 --> 06:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
if a parent had um reason to be
 
06:16:52.110 --> 06:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about what their child was
 
06:16:54.628 --> 06:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
reading and sent him a note and
 
06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
requesting would you adhere to the their
 
06:17:00.788 --> 06:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
wishes in terms of what their CH child
 
06:17:03.628 --> 06:17:03.638 align:start position:0%
could take out of the library yeah thank
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
you for your question um was not a
 
06:17:06.510 --> 06:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
school librarian I was in a public
 
06:17:09.350 --> 06:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
library so I can't speak to what I what
 
06:17:11.628 --> 06:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
a school librarian may or may not do but
 
06:17:15.110 --> 06:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
I um I think
 
06:17:17.590 --> 06:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
that again it's about that relationship
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
with with your child and and respecting
 
06:17:21.590 --> 06:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know building that relationship and
 
06:17:23.110 --> 06:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
having an understanding of what they
 
06:17:24.590 --> 06:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
they are or not
 
06:17:24.600 --> 06:17:26.350 align:start position:0%
they are or not
reading

06:17:26.350 --> 06:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
reading
 
06:17:29.350 --> 06:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah representa Morse thank you thank
 
06:17:30.868 --> 06:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question again uh
 
06:17:32.150 --> 06:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
based off your testimony when it comes
 
06:17:34.670 --> 06:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
to parental oversight with these books
 
06:17:36.390 --> 06:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
and in their children's hands currently
 
06:17:38.910 --> 06:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
there may not be any parental oversight
 
06:17:41.150 --> 06:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
with the current way that schools are
 
06:17:43.150 --> 06:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
run and their libraries are run so it
 
06:17:44.310 --> 06:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
almost sounds to me like you'd be in
 
06:17:45.990 --> 06:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill because it would
 
06:17:48.070 --> 06:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
allow parental oversight whereas
 
06:17:51.468 --> 06:17:51.478 align:start position:0%
currently there is none am I wrong no
 
06:17:53.830 --> 06:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
that is incorrect and I apologize if I
 
06:17:56.430 --> 06:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
have miscommunicated my uh sentiments on
 
06:18:00.670 --> 06:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
this topic um what I am saying is that
 
06:18:01.990 --> 06:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
as a
 
06:18:05.468 --> 06:18:05.478 align:start position:0%
parent I can tell my daughter she's two
 
06:18:07.150 --> 06:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
so we're reading we're reading muala a
 
06:18:08.708 --> 06:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
laot right now okay but I can I can
 
06:18:10.110 --> 06:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
choose what my daughter is reading and
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
as she gets older we can have
 
06:18:14.310 --> 06:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
conversations but I do not feel it is
 
06:18:16.310 --> 06:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
right for one parent to dictate what an
 
06:18:19.350 --> 06:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
entire School Board of entire school
 
06:18:22.868 --> 06:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:25.708 --> 06:18:25.718 align:start position:0%
accessing follow follow
 
06:18:28.190 --> 06:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
up so particular with the book I
 
06:18:29.990 --> 06:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned a little while ago would you
 
06:18:32.070 --> 06:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
allow your 10-year-old to be able to
 
06:18:34.150 --> 06:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
read a book as such respectfully I don't
 
06:18:38.430 --> 06:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
think that is relevant to this thank
 
06:18:41.230 --> 06:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:18:43.510 --> 06:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing that thank you thank
 
06:18:51.070 --> 06:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:58.948 --> 06:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:03.030 --> 06:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
sure Pasha Roberts or
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%

committee and I am posha Roberts I live
 
06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
in wilmet New Hampshire and I'm the on
 
06:19:43.468 --> 06:19:43.478 align:start position:0%
the board of 63 equality and I'm
 
06:19:45.750 --> 06:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
speaking today against HP
 
06:19:49.150 --> 06:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
324 so proponents of this bill will be
 
06:19:51.270 --> 06:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
and actually already are parading
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
cherry-picked extreme sounding material
 
06:19:56.270 --> 06:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
before this committee today please do
 
06:19:58.628 --> 06:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
not mistake the forest for the
 
06:20:01.910 --> 06:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
trees first any child with a phone or
 
06:20:04.110 --> 06:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
internet connection can easily find any
 
06:20:05.190 --> 06:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
of this
 
06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
and more without having to go through
 
06:20:09.868 --> 06:20:09.878 align:start position:0%
the trouble of reading a book the reason
 
06:20:11.708 --> 06:20:11.718 align:start position:0%
that these books are deemed dangerous is
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
not their spicy scenes but the narrative
 
06:20:17.750 --> 06:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
power of the stories inside of them
 
06:20:19.390 --> 06:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
these controversial books including
 
06:20:22.230 --> 06:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
gender queer are not stories about the
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
pizza man coming to the house these are
 
06:20:28.190 --> 06:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
coming of age stories with emotional
 
06:20:30.548 --> 06:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
Nuance they're companions for young
 
06:20:32.310 --> 06:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
adults as they navigate the difficult
 
06:20:36.150 --> 06:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
corridors of growing up in 2020 5 the
 
06:20:37.990 --> 06:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
books frankly walk through the life and
 
06:20:41.110 --> 06:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
challenges of real raw people by reading
 
06:20:42.990 --> 06:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
about them a reader can decide whether
 
06:20:45.990 --> 06:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
they are or are not like these
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
characters I trust them to do that kids
 
06:20:48.718 --> 06:20:49.590 align:start position:0%
characters I trust them to do that kids
are

06:20:49.590 --> 06:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:20:52.628 --> 06:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
smart there is a moral
 
06:20:55.788 --> 06:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
Panic around gender in this country
 
06:20:57.628 --> 06:20:57.638 align:start position:0%
young adults who question whether they
 
06:20:59.548 --> 06:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
are gay lesbian or transgender are
 
06:21:01.868 --> 06:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
particularly at risk of having every
 
06:21:03.910 --> 06:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
shred of affirming narrative removed
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
from their Library
 
06:21:08.150 --> 06:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
I don't want them growing up in a desert
 
06:21:11.590 --> 06:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
as I did in particular as a sexual abuse
 
06:21:14.230 --> 06:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
Survivor I would have benefited
 
06:21:16.430 --> 06:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
tremendously by seeing material that
 
06:21:18.150 --> 06:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
described what I went through even with
 
06:21:20.910 --> 06:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
the pictures that you don't like that
 
06:21:23.548 --> 06:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
normalized it took me out of isolation
 
06:21:25.670 --> 06:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
and gave me some insight about what I
 
06:21:27.510 --> 06:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
might do about it what I might do next
 
06:21:28.708 --> 06:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
how I might
 
06:21:30.830 --> 06:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
survive some of these books deemed
 
06:21:33.750 --> 06:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
obscene will be Lifesavers for abused
 
06:21:36.628 --> 06:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
kids and at their healing Society will
 
06:21:39.788 --> 06:21:39.798 align:start position:0%
be better for it that is their literary
 
06:21:42.430 --> 06:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
value in other states versions of this
 
06:21:44.990 --> 06:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
law have been used by small groups of
 
06:21:47.708 --> 06:21:47.718 align:start position:0%
individuals to prosecute a very narrow
 
06:21:50.910 --> 06:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
religious view onto Public Schools a
 
06:21:53.708 --> 06:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
single Agri parent could use the vague
 
06:21:56.510 --> 06:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
aggressive peran bounty hunting passages
 
06:21:59.868 --> 06:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
of HP 324 to cost the school district
 
06:22:02.468 --> 06:22:02.478 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars ruining the careers
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
of well-meaning school personnel it will
 
06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
lead to a chilling effect over
 
06:22:10.390 --> 06:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
compliance out of fear and empty shelves
 
06:22:12.468 --> 06:22:12.478 align:start position:0%
this is not Freedom this is not Live
 
06:22:15.628 --> 06:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
Free or Die Here No Good has ever come
 
06:22:19.070 --> 06:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
from centering books it might sound odd
 
06:22:21.830 --> 06:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
but kids need these books I emphatically
 
06:22:23.910 --> 06:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
encourage you to vote this bill
 
06:22:28.110 --> 06:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
itl any questions representative drive
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for ask
 
06:22:32.270 --> 06:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
answering this question we had someone
 
06:22:35.948 --> 06:22:35.958 align:start position:0%
testify a few minutes ago about tra kids
 
06:22:39.310 --> 06:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
who have had um uh tra uh traumatic
 
06:22:41.830 --> 06:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
experiences and this being a trigger for
 
06:22:44.750 --> 06:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
them instead so I wonder how you balance
 
06:22:46.910 --> 06:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
those things sure thank you for the
 
06:22:50.670 --> 06:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
question I am a survivor I can tell you
 
06:22:52.708 --> 06:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
that if I saw something that I wouldn't
 
06:22:54.270 --> 06:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
have been I wouldn't find the book I'd
 
06:22:55.990 --> 06:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
be looking for a book that said that
 
06:22:58.030 --> 06:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
tells me what did somebody else go
 
06:22:59.350 --> 06:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
through I mean these books didn't start
 
06:23:02.350 --> 06:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
coming out until like the 80s it was a
 
06:23:05.430 --> 06:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
desert um and these books start coming
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
out it it feeds you you may and I'm I'm
 
06:23:10.430 --> 06:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
glad you don't understand it means you
 
06:23:13.430 --> 06:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
haven't had to go through this so
 
06:23:15.390 --> 06:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
congratulations but if you've been
 
06:23:16.830 --> 06:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
through that kind of dark experience it
 
06:23:19.868 --> 06:23:19.878 align:start position:0%
really makes a huge difference to
 
06:23:22.948 --> 06:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
actually see it normalize it understand
 
06:23:25.390 --> 06:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
and know that you're not alone because
 
06:23:28.750 --> 06:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the abusers do they make you
 
06:23:30.670 --> 06:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
alone thank
 
06:23:33.510 --> 06:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
you representative mors thank you madam
 
06:23:35.510 --> 06:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:23:37.708 --> 06:23:37.718 align:start position:0%
similar to what um representative dry
 
06:23:40.430 --> 06:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
said as a sexual abuse Survivor first
 
06:23:41.868 --> 06:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
off I just want to apologize for you
 
06:23:43.510 --> 06:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
having to go through that I myself had
 
06:23:45.230 --> 06:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
the same situation happened a few
 
06:23:47.270 --> 06:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
different times in my history um and it
 
06:23:51.670 --> 06:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
does suck now um I was wondering how in
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
situations like you've mentioned where
 
06:23:56.708 --> 06:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
books could have been beneficial for you
 
06:23:59.190 --> 06:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
in recovery in essence yeah um is there
 
06:24:01.190 --> 06:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
a specific book or instance that you had
 
06:24:03.110 --> 06:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
that helped you recover because for me
 
06:24:05.670 --> 06:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
it had the opposite effect
 
06:24:08.948 --> 06:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
not I mean the first book that really um
 
06:24:10.548 --> 06:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
um you might not be able to tell but I'm
 
06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
a little old so these things books
 
06:24:14.110 --> 06:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
didn't exist I mean the first book that
 
06:24:16.150 --> 06:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
really I came into was the courage to
 
06:24:17.430 --> 06:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
heal which came out in
 
06:24:21.190 --> 06:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
1988 um which is um you know well after
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
I came out of school if I had found that
 
06:24:26.468 --> 06:24:26.478 align:start position:0%
wow um you know and there's still a very
 
06:24:29.548 --> 06:24:29.558 align:start position:0%
few books for male survivors so having
 
06:24:32.150 --> 06:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
um material on that in particular would
 
06:24:35.430 --> 06:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
have been amazing
 
06:24:37.070 --> 06:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:24:39.750 --> 06:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions see you none thank you okay
 
06:24:39.760 --> 06:24:45.670 align:start position:0%
questions see you none thank you okay
thank

06:24:45.670 --> 06:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:57.430 --> 06:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:00.110 --> 06:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
West hello members of the committee my
 
06:25:02.030 --> 06:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
name is McKenzie West and I am here to
 
06:25:04.990 --> 06:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
speak against House Bill 324
 
06:25:07.110 --> 06:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
under the rather confusing language of
 
06:25:09.430 --> 06:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
this bill it amounts to a book ban that
 
06:25:11.468 --> 06:25:11.478 align:start position:0%
financially incentivizes parents to
 
06:25:13.990 --> 06:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
attack Public public education and
 
06:25:15.788 --> 06:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
school resources that are already
 
06:25:18.750 --> 06:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
stretched then under this bill parents
 
06:25:20.510 --> 06:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
will have the ability to challenge book
 
06:25:22.468 --> 06:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
selections available in public schools
 
06:25:25.110 --> 06:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
to further prudish and religious Intrust
 
06:25:26.830 --> 06:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
against the will of the
 
06:25:29.948 --> 06:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
majority this bill aims to be a solution
 
06:25:32.510 --> 06:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
to a problem that does not verifiably
 
06:25:35.868 --> 06:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
exist on Mass since when does a school
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
library carry books that are
 
06:25:39.510 --> 06:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for the Target
 
06:25:41.910 --> 06:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
demographic the truth of the matter is
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
they do not and that is already
 
06:25:46.030 --> 06:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
accomplished through the underpaid and
 
06:25:47.670 --> 06:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
underappreciated work of school
 
06:25:49.270 --> 06:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
librarians and
 
06:25:52.350 --> 06:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
administrators what this bill aims to do
 
06:25:55.670 --> 06:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
is in part Target queer people to say
 
06:25:57.590 --> 06:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
that our existence is inherently and
 
06:26:00.150 --> 06:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
falsely sexual and therefore deemed
 
06:26:01.990 --> 06:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for school
 
06:26:05.190 --> 06:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
children as a trans woman and a lesan is
 
06:26:07.830 --> 06:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
my experience inherently
 
06:26:10.150 --> 06:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
inappropriate many proponents of this
 
06:26:12.628 --> 06:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill and the ones like it would argue
 
06:26:15.070 --> 06:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
yes even though my experience is no more
 
06:26:17.510 --> 06:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
explicit or inappropriate than any CIS
 
06:26:19.548 --> 06:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
hat experience those
 
06:26:22.868 --> 06:26:22.878 align:start position:0%
prominent seek to erase similar sto
 
06:26:25.390 --> 06:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
stories to mine so that they can erase
 
06:26:28.468 --> 06:26:28.478 align:start position:0%
people like me it signals an early stage
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
of genocide and in the end it protects
 
06:26:34.868 --> 06:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
no one what are are the kids to learn
 
06:26:37.390 --> 06:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
when we blind them to in ignorance and
 
06:26:39.788 --> 06:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
darkness and how do we prepare them for
 
06:26:41.868 --> 06:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
the world when we only tell them
 
06:26:44.030 --> 06:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
sanitize stories that don't cover the
 
06:26:46.110 --> 06:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
experiences of a varied
 
06:26:48.390 --> 06:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
population I hope that we don't let
 
06:26:50.468 --> 06:26:50.478 align:start position:0%
ignorance and darkness win and I urge
 
06:26:53.310 --> 06:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
you to vote itl and house bu
 
06:26:56.390 --> 06:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
324 thank you any
 
06:26:59.070 --> 06:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:26:59.080 --> 06:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
much

06:27:05.190 --> 06:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:05.200 --> 06:27:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
AJ

06:27:13.830 --> 06:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:16.830 --> 06:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
klei hello I think I wrote two minutes
 
06:27:18.468 --> 06:27:18.478 align:start position:0%
on the thing but if you're giving people
 
06:27:23.628 --> 06:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
more I'll take it um so I actually wrote
 
06:27:26.670 --> 06:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
this in preparation I guess seems to me
 
06:27:28.150 --> 06:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the government's motive behind
 
06:27:29.708 --> 06:27:29.718 align:start position:0%
attempting to address these kinds of
 
06:27:31.830 --> 06:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
impressionistic issues into neatly laid
 
06:27:34.310 --> 06:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
out objective regulations is very
 
06:27:36.190 --> 06:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
plainly an ongoing effort to create a
 
06:27:37.910 --> 06:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
common enemy among a group of people who
 
06:27:39.990 --> 06:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
they pretend to sympathize with the
 
06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
average everyday Americans or the silent
 
06:27:44.510 --> 06:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
majority but really we working class
 
06:27:46.190 --> 06:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
families haven't a single reason not to
 
06:27:47.990 --> 06:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
unite as human beings I think we all
 
06:27:50.070 --> 06:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
want to protect our children as seen in
 
06:27:51.628 --> 06:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
the current constitutional Protections
 
06:27:53.190 --> 06:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
in place prohibiting obscene material
 
06:27:55.670 --> 06:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
for miners so in such a time of genuine
 
06:27:57.910 --> 06:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
Countrywide turmoil the attention being
 
06:27:59.670 --> 06:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
given to these kinds of bills all across
 
06:28:01.430 --> 06:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
the nation translates to me like
 
06:28:03.548 --> 06:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
needless pot stirring we all think
 
06:28:06.070 --> 06:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
showing kids inappropriate contents no
 
06:28:08.468 --> 06:28:08.478 align:start position:0%
good but we literally can't even afford
 
06:28:10.590 --> 06:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
groceries right now why during a
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
legitimate crisis are we choosing to
 
06:28:13.670 --> 06:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
fight culture wars instead of getting
 
06:28:15.350 --> 06:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
all hands on deck to improve our most
 
06:28:17.110 --> 06:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
dire struggles for things like housing
 
06:28:19.430 --> 06:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
and food not only are we being fooled
 
06:28:20.990 --> 06:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
into becoming more divided with this
 
06:28:23.070 --> 06:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
crap but and distracted from our biggest
 
06:28:24.910 --> 06:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
problems but I feel like it's pretty
 
06:28:27.030 --> 06:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
dumb for politicians to try and codify a
 
06:28:29.670 --> 06:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
paradigm into law and this goes for any
 
06:28:31.150 --> 06:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
sort of Paradigm doesn't matter if it's
 
06:28:33.430 --> 06:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
bigoted or not it just doesn't work to
 
06:28:35.510 --> 06:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
address OT Ally charged right brain
 
06:28:37.708 --> 06:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
issues with a strong armed left brain
 
06:28:39.270 --> 06:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
regime that only sees everything in
 
06:28:41.150 --> 06:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
Black and White legal definitions
 
06:28:42.510 --> 06:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
function the most properly when they
 
06:28:44.390 --> 06:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
concern unquestionable facts and are
 
06:28:46.868 --> 06:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
straightforward such as murder a person
 
06:28:48.868 --> 06:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
often clearly appears either dead or
 
06:28:51.628 --> 06:28:51.638 align:start position:0%
alive um you know what kind of stuff I
 
06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
think is less clear of an ultimate legal
 
06:28:57.070 --> 06:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
definition words like inappropriate in
 
06:29:00.070 --> 06:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
artistic and shameful like that's that's
 
06:29:02.150 --> 06:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the bill or whatever I mean just take
 
06:29:03.628 --> 06:29:03.638 align:start position:0%
the sentence in the bill it goes the
 
06:29:03.638 --> 06:29:04.990 align:start position:0%
the sentence in the bill it goes the
material

06:29:04.990 --> 06:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
material
 
06:29:07.030 --> 06:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
if the material lacks serious literary
 
06:29:09.190 --> 06:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
scientific medical artistic or political
 
06:29:10.510 --> 06:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
value for minors then it can be
 
06:29:12.628 --> 06:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
considered harmful each person defines
 
06:29:14.270 --> 06:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
something's value differently especially
 
06:29:16.270 --> 06:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
artistic or political value not to
 
06:29:17.910 --> 06:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
mention the way serious is thrown in
 
06:29:19.310 --> 06:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
there how is one to Define on an
 
06:29:21.150 --> 06:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
objective basis the meaning of serious
 
06:29:23.070 --> 06:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
value the whole thing just reeks of
 
06:29:24.868 --> 06:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
personal bias if I were you I would be
 
06:29:29.030 --> 06:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
very questionable of all this um all
 
06:29:30.788 --> 06:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
right and then when the person was
 
06:29:32.670 --> 06:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
introducing this build they were using
 
06:29:35.110 --> 06:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
words like pornographic graphic to
 
06:29:37.750 --> 06:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
describe I think they said like some kid
 
06:29:39.310 --> 06:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
was reading a pornographic book and they
 
06:29:41.190 --> 06:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
asked for a graphic copy or the library
 
06:29:43.590 --> 06:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
asked if they want a graphic copy be a
 
06:29:45.150 --> 06:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific with your
 
06:29:46.590 --> 06:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
language I don't understand this
 
06:29:50.310 --> 06:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and the vagueness um again
 
06:29:52.430 --> 06:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
when representative sorry no I can't do
 
06:29:52.440 --> 06:29:53.510 align:start position:0%
when representative sorry no I can't do
that

06:29:53.510 --> 06:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:57.670 --> 06:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
um I learned I can't do that um earlier
 
06:29:59.150 --> 06:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you mentioned a
 
06:30:00.590 --> 06:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
certain group of people who need to
 
06:30:03.150 --> 06:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
certain see a certain kind of material
 
06:30:05.430 --> 06:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
again why we not being specific here it
 
06:30:07.628 --> 06:30:07.638 align:start position:0%
feels like we're purposefully hiding
 
06:30:12.230 --> 06:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
behind this like professional formal in
 
06:30:13.948 --> 06:30:13.958 align:start position:0%
the name of Public Safety sounding
 
06:30:16.030 --> 06:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
rhetoric when in reality we're doing
 
06:30:18.110 --> 06:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional things that are not
 
06:30:21.868 --> 06:30:21.878 align:start position:0%
okay just me but I I don't know um also
 
06:30:23.788 --> 06:30:23.798 align:start position:0%
what X or R rated movies are being shown
 
06:30:25.788 --> 06:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
in schools what schools have Playboy
 
06:30:27.270 --> 06:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
magazines in their libraries come on
 
06:30:29.230 --> 06:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
people um why do you think numbers are
 
06:30:30.628 --> 06:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
dropping in the public Ed system it's
 
06:30:31.948 --> 06:30:31.958 align:start position:0%
terribly funded and it's the government
 
06:30:33.468 --> 06:30:33.478 align:start position:0%

06:31:23.868 --> 06:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro deing High School I'm here to
 
06:31:25.628 --> 06:31:25.638 align:start position:0%
represent the reality of what is being
 
06:31:27.708 --> 06:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
presented to kids in public schools I
 
06:31:29.310 --> 06:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
have worked as a sex offender counselor
 
06:31:31.150 --> 06:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
at the state prison so I'm well aware of
 
06:31:32.788 --> 06:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
what tools are used to groom and offend
 
06:31:34.990 --> 06:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
our children four years ago my
 
06:31:36.548 --> 06:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
freshman's son first showed me
 
06:31:38.350 --> 06:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate Library content that was
 
06:31:39.990 --> 06:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
being promoted to his buddy through his
 
06:31:42.150 --> 06:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
school Chromebook he was sent to the
 
06:31:44.270 --> 06:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
principal for reading it out loud the
 
06:31:45.948 --> 06:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
principal agreed it was inappropriate
 
06:31:47.750 --> 06:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
but just sent him to his next class
 
06:31:49.468 --> 06:31:49.478 align:start position:0%
nothing was ever done about the presence
 
06:31:51.548 --> 06:31:51.558 align:start position:0%
of the inappropriate content so I
 
06:31:53.468 --> 06:31:53.478 align:start position:0%
decided to look at his School's online
 
06:31:57.750 --> 06:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
library app called sora for myself I was
 
06:32:01.110 --> 06:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely shocked at what I saw it
 
06:32:03.190 --> 06:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't just age inappropriate content
 
06:32:05.868 --> 06:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
but i w it privately connecting our
 
06:32:08.110 --> 06:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
children to sex-seeking adults through
 
06:32:11.350 --> 06:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
their school Chromebooks let me explain
 
06:32:14.030 --> 06:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
the school book the book titled this
 
06:32:16.830 --> 06:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
book is gay by Juno Dawson is widely
 
06:32:19.110 --> 06:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
available in the Sora student Library
 
06:32:22.150 --> 06:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
shared New Hampshire online collection
 
06:32:24.070 --> 06:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
the book has working hyperlinks to
 
06:32:25.990 --> 06:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
match.com in the part of the book
 
06:32:29.030 --> 06:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
entitled how sex apps work it then goes
 
06:32:30.868 --> 06:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
on to explain what is wanted and
 
06:32:33.230 --> 06:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
expected from who they meet up with it
 
06:32:35.910 --> 06:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
tells them how to perform every possible
 
06:32:38.110 --> 06:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
sex act including acts I as a sex
 
06:32:40.388 --> 06:32:40.398 align:start position:0%
offender have never heard of it
 
06:32:43.070 --> 06:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
blatantly gives sex misinformation
 
06:32:45.708 --> 06:32:45.718 align:start position:0%
linking kids to sex-seeking adults
 
06:32:48.868 --> 06:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
already has a name we call it sex
 
06:32:50.868 --> 06:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
trafficking the problem of age
 
06:32:53.150 --> 06:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
inappropriate content in our schools is
 
06:32:55.910 --> 06:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
very real our kids are in actual danger
 
06:32:57.590 --> 06:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
if we don't re in the Liberties that
 
06:32:59.190 --> 06:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
some of these organizations are taking
 
06:33:02.510 --> 06:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
with our kids some boundaries need to be
 
06:33:04.510 --> 06:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
set here when when I first brought up
 
06:33:06.510 --> 06:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
the issue with my school board privately
 
06:33:08.468 --> 06:33:08.478 align:start position:0%
they banned my children from using all
 
06:33:10.628 --> 06:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
School libraries as their solution that
 
06:33:13.270 --> 06:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
was four years ago Banning top students
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
from using School libraries won't solve
 
06:33:18.070 --> 06:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
this problem promoting age inappropriate
 
06:33:19.990 --> 06:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
content to school children isn't right
 
06:33:22.070 --> 06:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
no matter how you present it it's
 
06:33:24.628 --> 06:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
undeniably inappropriate we need a
 
06:33:26.468 --> 06:33:26.478 align:start position:0%
system that weeds out the legitimately
 
06:33:28.150 --> 06:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous age inappropriate books in our
 
06:33:30.150 --> 06:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
school libraries we wouldn't allow
 
06:33:32.548 --> 06:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
penous stories to be an option yet the
 
06:33:34.150 --> 06:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
book I've been describing is
 
06:33:36.270 --> 06:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
exponentially worse than any Penthouse
 
06:33:38.830 --> 06:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
story I'm aware of a disturbing incident
 
06:33:40.590 --> 06:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
that occurred at kirar high school
 
06:33:42.868 --> 06:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
during their recent deliberative session
 
06:33:44.708 --> 06:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers were put into the library as
 
06:33:47.310 --> 06:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
an overflow space a parent randomly
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
picked up a book and opened it to a
 
06:33:51.670 --> 06:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
picture of an actual orgy a scene of an
 
06:33:53.548 --> 06:33:53.558 align:start position:0%
undressed man sitting in a chair with a
 
06:33:55.708 --> 06:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
woman on her knees bent before him head
 
06:33:57.990 --> 06:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
between her his legs with two other
 
06:33:59.830 --> 06:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
women at his sides with his fingers in
 
06:34:02.510 --> 06:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
their mouths she showed the book Saga
 
06:34:04.948 --> 06:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
series book four to others in the crowd
 
06:34:06.990 --> 06:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
including the police the book was
 
06:34:09.548 --> 06:34:09.558 align:start position:0%
ultimately removed I think everyone can
 
06:34:11.150 --> 06:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
agree pictures of orgies are
 
06:34:13.230 --> 06:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for school libraries
 
06:34:15.270 --> 06:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers don't want to pay for over
 
06:34:17.628 --> 06:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
sexualizing kids they'd rather protect
 
06:34:20.030 --> 06:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
them please see the necessity of this
 
06:34:22.430 --> 06:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill and vote to support it I'm happy to
 
06:34:24.110 --> 06:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and I hope I get
 
06:34:26.230 --> 06:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to show you I have the
 
06:34:28.590 --> 06:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
Sora app right here on my phone ready to

could you please repeat to me the name
 
06:34:42.750 --> 06:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
of the app Sora s o r a it's widely
 
06:34:44.750 --> 06:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
available it's not available in every
 
06:34:46.948 --> 06:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
public school but it's widely available
 
06:34:49.350 --> 06:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
and there is a shared collection called
 
06:34:51.388 --> 06:34:51.398 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire shared collection and
 
06:34:54.788 --> 06:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
this book with that sex trafficking link
 
06:34:57.030 --> 06:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
is in it so it's literally widely
 
06:34:59.110 --> 06:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
available to thousands of high school
 
06:35:01.230 --> 06:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
students around our state and could be
 
06:35:04.150 --> 06:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
other schools besides High School I know
 
06:35:06.990 --> 06:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
the way it's um put in the Sora app that
 
06:35:08.788 --> 06:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
it it should be just for high school
 
06:35:12.788 --> 06:35:12.798 align:start position:0%
students if the librarian is doing their
 
06:35:16.590 --> 06:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
job represent Paul chair I think we take
 
06:35:19.030 --> 06:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
my question so that story was four years
 
06:35:21.548 --> 06:35:21.558 align:start position:0%
ago this app right four years ago my
 
06:35:23.430 --> 06:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
kids haven't used the library since then
 
06:35:24.590 --> 06:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
so you don't know if that's still
 
06:35:26.628 --> 06:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
happening you're it still there I have
 
06:35:28.150 --> 06:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
the app so my kids aren't allowed to use
 
06:35:29.708 --> 06:35:29.718 align:start position:0%
it so I have it on my phone here so I
 
06:35:32.388 --> 06:35:32.398 align:start position:0%
can show you I have it open on my phone
 
06:35:34.150 --> 06:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
right now this book is gay and I can
 
06:35:36.590 --> 06:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
show you the hyperlink but my question
 
06:35:38.388 --> 06:35:38.398 align:start position:0%
the question is followup question
 
06:35:41.830 --> 06:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
followup okay thank you um is that
 
06:35:43.750 --> 06:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
schools have filters I
 
06:35:46.468 --> 06:35:46.478 align:start position:0%
mean you're sure right now the school
 
06:35:48.388 --> 06:35:48.398 align:start position:0%
can access that link every kid in the
 
06:35:49.708 --> 06:35:49.718 align:start position:0%
every kid in the state of New hav can
 
06:35:52.270 --> 06:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
access that link or some kids I you have
 
06:35:53.990 --> 06:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
proved that that's the case so any
 
06:35:56.708 --> 06:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
school can add or subtract a book from
 
06:35:59.388 --> 06:35:59.398 align:start position:0%
this from this app so they can make it
 
06:36:01.868 --> 06:36:01.878 align:start position:0%
for their you know used best for their
 
06:36:05.110 --> 06:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
own school it comes free it's
 
06:36:08.230 --> 06:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
$250 to get over 8,000 books so that
 
06:36:10.430 --> 06:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
book comes free with that New Hampshire
 
06:36:13.070 --> 06:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
shared collection that everyone who gets
 
06:36:15.230 --> 06:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
Sora gets that in New
 
06:36:18.910 --> 06:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:21.430 --> 06:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
available yet now the librarian would
 
06:36:23.670 --> 06:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
have to remove that book because it
 
06:36:25.030 --> 06:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
automatically comes free with that
 
06:36:28.230 --> 06:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
Library one more follow please sure okay
 
06:36:29.990 --> 06:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
the question is all students in the
 
06:36:32.070 --> 06:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire if the school if
 
06:36:35.230 --> 06:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
that whatever that app is they can click
 
06:36:38.030 --> 06:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
on those links and get live action or
 
06:36:39.628 --> 06:36:39.638 align:start position:0%
whatever you're talking about any
 
06:36:43.310 --> 06:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
student that has the Sora app that it
 
06:36:45.910 --> 06:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
that H their librarian could remove this
 
06:36:48.230 --> 06:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
book so My Librarian has not it's
 
06:36:51.548 --> 06:36:51.558 align:start position:0%
available to my kids but any child that
 
06:36:54.190 --> 06:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
uses the Sora app could use that they
 
06:36:55.830 --> 06:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
take the book out just like I have it
 
06:36:57.030 --> 06:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
right here I can show you because it's
 
06:37:00.830 --> 06:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
my kids account and they can link to
 
06:37:03.150 --> 06:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
match.com in the part of the book that
 
06:37:06.110 --> 06:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
says how sex apps work that's sex
 
06:37:07.628 --> 06:37:07.638 align:start position:0%
trafficking I was a sex Defender
 
06:37:09.110 --> 06:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
counselor I know what it
 
06:37:11.350 --> 06:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
means we need
 
06:37:14.030 --> 06:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
this any other
 
06:37:22.030 --> 06:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:34.030 --> 06:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:36.230 --> 06:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record anry
 
06:37:38.670 --> 06:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
Banfield I'm a parental rights Advocate
 
06:37:41.150 --> 06:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
education researcher focused on acade
 
06:37:43.590 --> 06:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
academic excellence and education I
 
06:37:45.190 --> 06:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
think we're starting to hear why so many
 
06:37:48.230 --> 06:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
families are leaving the public
 
06:37:52.510 --> 06:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
schools so stopit now.org is a is an
 
06:37:54.830 --> 06:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
organization that's directed towards
 
06:37:57.070 --> 06:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
stopping sexual abuse in children and if
 
06:37:59.230 --> 06:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
you go to that website there is a
 
06:38:01.788 --> 06:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
portion that says when you hand children
 
06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
pornographic or obscene materials it's
 
06:38:06.910 --> 06:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
considered child sexual
 
06:38:06.920 --> 06:38:08.750 align:start position:0%
considered child sexual
abuse

06:38:08.750 --> 06:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
06:38:11.030 --> 06:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the part that I'm going to
 
06:38:13.548 --> 06:38:13.558 align:start position:0%
talk about I get that there are
 
06:38:16.350 --> 06:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
subjective books in the library and when
 
06:38:18.030 --> 06:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
I get a call from a parent about
 
06:38:21.270 --> 06:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
something like that my advice to them is
 
06:38:24.350 --> 06:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that there's books
 
06:38:26.628 --> 06:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
that we don't like going to have to get
 
06:38:29.270 --> 06:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
over it and then there's where you cross
 
06:38:32.430 --> 06:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
a line and we're seeing when you're
 
06:38:35.590 --> 06:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
crossing a line and that's pornography
 
06:38:37.670 --> 06:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
obscenity when you are crossing a line
 
06:38:40.270 --> 06:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
when you can't listen in in the chambers
 
06:38:43.350 --> 06:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
to what the representatives reading
 
06:38:46.670 --> 06:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're crossing a line and they Define it
 
06:38:48.670 --> 06:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
as child sexual
 
06:38:50.990 --> 06:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
abuse I do think that there should be
 
06:38:52.468 --> 06:38:52.478 align:start position:0%
transparency I don't think that this
 
06:38:55.230 --> 06:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
bill probably goes far enough I do
 
06:38:57.070 --> 06:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
support it but I would like to see more
 
06:38:59.830 --> 06:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
transparency so parents can get more
 
06:39:02.190 --> 06:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
involved because I think with when when
 
06:39:04.350 --> 06:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
parents are more involved then see this
 
06:39:06.868 --> 06:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
they're not quite as likely to run from
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
the school or pull their kids out of the
 
06:39:11.150 --> 06:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
school that now they feel like at least
 
06:39:16.628 --> 06:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:19.670 --> 06:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
so you can opt out of objectional
 
06:39:21.910 --> 06:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
materials in school and again I don't
 
06:39:24.150 --> 06:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
want the objectional materials in the
 
06:39:24.160 --> 06:39:25.190 align:start position:0%
want the objectional materials in the
same

06:39:25.190 --> 06:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:39:29.030 --> 06:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
category um but you know the Supreme
 
06:39:31.430 --> 06:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
Court justice justice Potter Stewart was
 
06:39:34.030 --> 06:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
asked to describe his test for obs in in
 
06:39:37.548 --> 06:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
1964 and he said I know it when I see it
 
06:39:40.548 --> 06:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
I think we all know it when we see
 
06:39:45.628 --> 06:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
it picture of two males engaged in oral
 
06:39:47.430 --> 06:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
sex and I don't care if it's two males
 
06:39:49.750 --> 06:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
or a male and a female I mean making
 
06:39:52.230 --> 06:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
this about the lgbtq community it
 
06:39:55.388 --> 06:39:55.398 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter it could be heterosexual
 
06:39:57.868 --> 06:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
there is a line and when you cross over
 
06:40:00.430 --> 06:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
it that's where I think that this bill
 
06:40:03.430 --> 06:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
is trying to go let's stop with where
 
06:40:05.468 --> 06:40:05.478 align:start position:0%
you're crossing over that line or at
 
06:40:08.750 --> 06:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
least let's have a parent be part of a
 
06:40:13.230 --> 06:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
process to logically and and make an
 
06:40:15.868 --> 06:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
argument as why this is harmful to
 
06:40:18.708 --> 06:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
Children I've never seen a parent take a
 
06:40:21.070 --> 06:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
Biology book to a school board and say
 
06:40:22.310 --> 06:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
this is inappropriate when they're
 
06:40:24.110 --> 06:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
trying to teach biology I don't know
 
06:40:26.990 --> 06:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
about you but I haven't seen it um
 
06:40:29.388 --> 06:40:29.398 align:start position:0%
you're also asking taxpayers to pay for
 
06:40:32.388 --> 06:40:32.398 align:start position:0%
this and that's why you know I look for
 
06:40:34.468 --> 06:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
things like how can we come together on
 
06:40:37.708 --> 06:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
this how can we find a way to address
 
06:40:39.948 --> 06:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
this issue that's driving some families
 
06:40:41.788 --> 06:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
out of the public schools I mean you're
 
06:40:44.750 --> 06:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
against efas or you're for efas and then
 
06:40:46.830 --> 06:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
when you set these situations up that
 
06:40:49.830 --> 06:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
drive parents out I'm like can we find
 
06:40:52.350 --> 06:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
something that keeps them in the school
 
06:40:54.270 --> 06:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
where they don't have to pull their kids
 
06:40:56.548 --> 06:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
out because it's not
 
06:40:56.558 --> 06:40:58.350 align:start position:0%
out because it's not
familyfriendly

06:40:58.350 --> 06:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
familyfriendly
 
06:41:00.788 --> 06:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
um these books I'm sorry I think are
 
06:41:03.430 --> 06:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
used to also groom children that's all I
 
06:41:06.310 --> 06:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
have to say are there any questions
 
06:41:08.590 --> 06:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
representative litfield thank you madam
 
06:41:10.270 --> 06:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:41:13.270 --> 06:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
question my question is um we had
 
06:41:14.910 --> 06:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
another representative bring up
 
06:41:17.230 --> 06:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
questioning if had it been several years
 
06:41:19.070 --> 06:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
since there were issues with these books
 
06:41:21.670 --> 06:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
I know as a child advocate you get calls
 
06:41:23.150 --> 06:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm ass I don't know how often you get
 
06:41:25.388 --> 06:41:25.398 align:start position:0%
them what was the most recent call you
 
06:41:26.830 --> 06:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
received or have you received from the
 
06:41:28.910 --> 06:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
past six months or year is this is this
 
06:41:30.670 --> 06:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
an older problem that's kind of
 
06:41:33.628 --> 06:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
resolving itself or is this ongoing I
 
06:41:35.948 --> 06:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
think what you're experiencing is people
 
06:41:37.190 --> 06:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
giving up I think what you're
 
06:41:39.388 --> 06:41:39.398 align:start position:0%
experiencing is is people saying I'm not
 
06:41:41.350 --> 06:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
going to bother going to my school board
 
06:41:42.990 --> 06:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
because they don't listen to me or my
 
06:41:44.388 --> 06:41:44.398 align:start position:0%
schools and they don't listen to me so
 
06:41:46.510 --> 06:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
they just pull their kids out and so
 
06:41:48.670 --> 06:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
when you hear less and less and yes I do
 
06:41:50.830 --> 06:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
hear from parents still yes I certainly
 
06:41:54.788 --> 06:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
do um but what happens is after a while
 
06:41:56.948 --> 06:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
people you have a you have a school
 
06:41:59.110 --> 06:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
choice you can you can make that you can
 
06:42:00.910 --> 06:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
now make that decision to pull your kids
 
06:42:02.910 --> 06:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
out and go somewhere else you know we
 
06:42:02.920 --> 06:42:03.708 align:start position:0%
out and go somewhere else you know we
have

06:42:03.708 --> 06:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:42:05.430 --> 06:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
ratings I think it was you that asked
 
06:42:08.190 --> 06:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
about the ratings on movies and things
 
06:42:10.350 --> 06:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
like that that's very parent friendly
 
06:42:12.190 --> 06:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
you know I can look at at a movie you
 
06:42:14.788 --> 06:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
know when my son was growing up uh he
 
06:42:17.030 --> 06:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
had a a a friend that would come over
 
06:42:19.150 --> 06:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
and his parents
 
06:42:21.388 --> 06:42:21.398 align:start position:0%
said this the boy wasn't allowed to
 
06:42:24.788 --> 06:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
watch or read Harry Potter Potter books
 
06:42:26.628 --> 06:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
my son read Harry Potter books but he
 
06:42:28.110 --> 06:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
didn't pull them out and give them to
 
06:42:31.310 --> 06:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
his son it's called respect I respected
 
06:42:33.628 --> 06:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
her we had a difference of opinion but
 
06:42:35.430 --> 06:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's like we need to show some parents
 
06:42:37.270 --> 06:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
respect that means making things
 
06:42:39.868 --> 06:42:39.878 align:start position:0%
transparent so parents can be involved
 
06:42:41.230 --> 06:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
and then they're not throw you know
 
06:42:43.270 --> 06:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
having to remove their kids but yes it's
 
06:42:45.430 --> 06:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
still going on it's still going on I
 
06:42:47.230 --> 06:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
just think that things sometimes die
 
06:42:49.990 --> 06:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
down I I see it in other areas you know
 
06:42:52.468 --> 06:42:52.478 align:start position:0%
getting people to come out and and speak
 
06:42:54.388 --> 06:42:54.398 align:start position:0%
before you they're I've given up I've
 
06:42:55.990 --> 06:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
taken my kid out why why would I even
 
06:42:58.350 --> 06:42:58.360 align:start position:0%

06:43:11.310 --> 06:43:11.320 align:start position:0%

06:43:24.670 --> 06:43:24.680 align:start position:0%

06:43:32.830 --> 06:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
very big privilege that we have to share
 
06:43:36.708 --> 06:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
and to um have free speech so um I
 
06:43:39.590 --> 06:43:39.600 align:start position:0%

06:43:45.990 --> 06:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
from Raymond I'm a mother of 13 I'm also
 
06:43:48.670 --> 06:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
a teacher I have become a school board
 
06:43:51.628 --> 06:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
member and a library trustee I am here
 
06:43:54.430 --> 06:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
to support this bill and ask you to vote
 
06:43:56.788 --> 06:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
in favor of it back when I was a kid
 
06:43:58.190 --> 06:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't have been a thing
 
06:44:00.548 --> 06:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
since it was agreed on by society that
 
06:44:02.468 --> 06:44:02.478 align:start position:0%
pornographic images are harmful to
 
06:44:04.430 --> 06:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
children and should be hidden from them
 
06:44:06.388 --> 06:44:06.398 align:start position:0%
I can remember even brown paper on
 
06:44:08.910 --> 06:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
magazines at the grocery stores fast
 
06:44:12.070 --> 06:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
forward to when I don't know but I can
 
06:44:15.030 --> 06:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
tell you I began to hear things in 2020
 
06:44:17.270 --> 06:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
especially that were very disturbing and
 
06:44:19.230 --> 06:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
about content leaking into schools that
 
06:44:21.468 --> 06:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate I thought not in New
 
06:44:23.868 --> 06:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire's safe in July
 
06:44:26.190 --> 06:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
2021 I went to a board meeting at the
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
Timberlane District on invitation of a
 
06:44:30.990 --> 06:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
friend and my ears and eyes were shocked
 
06:44:33.388 --> 06:44:33.398 align:start position:0%
this was July 15th 2021 at the
 
06:44:35.670 --> 06:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
Performing Arts Center in plastow I have
 
06:44:37.388 --> 06:44:37.398 align:start position:0%
some of this meeting recorded on my
 
06:44:39.750 --> 06:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
phone I also have the minutes printed to
 
06:44:41.868 --> 06:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
share the information I heard some of
 
06:44:43.910 --> 06:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion was about mask wearing
 
06:44:45.548 --> 06:44:45.558 align:start position:0%
and some of the information I did not
 
06:44:47.628 --> 06:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
expect to hear there were parents there
 
06:44:49.628 --> 06:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
that were upset that 22 children were
 
06:44:52.150 --> 06:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
chosen by some teachers to form a club
 
06:44:54.190 --> 06:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
with kids and kids were told not to tell
 
06:44:56.388 --> 06:44:56.398 align:start position:0%
their parents the parents found out a
 
06:44:58.350 --> 06:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
few weeks after the club started and
 
06:45:00.990 --> 06:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
were enraged they came to this meeting
 
06:45:02.788 --> 06:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
and read some of the content the kids
 
06:45:05.788 --> 06:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
were exposed to police hating negativity
 
06:45:08.468 --> 06:45:08.478 align:start position:0%
to First Responders and sexual content
 
06:45:11.110 --> 06:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
materials I was not only shocked by what
 
06:45:13.270 --> 06:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
the parents were saying but I was also
 
06:45:15.150 --> 06:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
shocked by some of the board members
 
06:45:17.670 --> 06:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
attitudes and reactions to the content
 
06:45:19.548 --> 06:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
some of the board members were quite
 
06:45:21.948 --> 06:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
disrespectful to the very parents who
 
06:45:24.708 --> 06:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
had been deceived by these actions some
 
06:45:26.510 --> 06:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the school board members actually
 
06:45:28.750 --> 06:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
argued when asked to investigate this
 
06:45:31.190 --> 06:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
matter further I have video of their
 
06:45:33.510 --> 06:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
reactions I did not keep up with the
 
06:45:35.548 --> 06:45:35.558 align:start position:0%
follow through on this day but it did
 
06:45:37.590 --> 06:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
open my eyes to the possibility of the
 
06:45:39.270 --> 06:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
problems we might have throughout New
 
06:45:41.788 --> 06:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools the fact is
 
06:45:43.708 --> 06:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
inappropriate content was presented to
 
06:45:45.750 --> 06:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
children without the parents' knowledge
 
06:45:47.430 --> 06:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
parents should never have to fear that
 
06:45:49.230 --> 06:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
the school is doing anything to harm
 
06:45:50.708 --> 06:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
children and especially behind their
 
06:45:53.230 --> 06:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
back this can and is happening in New
 
06:45:54.788 --> 06:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I also know from hearing
 
06:45:57.230 --> 06:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
Rumblings around my town that parents
 
06:45:59.070 --> 06:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to step up against these
 
06:46:01.030 --> 06:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
types of things for fear that their kids
 
06:46:03.388 --> 06:46:03.398 align:start position:0%
might be treated badly because of it of
 
06:46:05.110 --> 06:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
course parents don't want their kids to
 
06:46:07.910 --> 06:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
be treated badly because they they they
 
06:46:09.590 --> 06:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
are trying to protect all of the
 
06:46:12.030 --> 06:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
children I support this bill because it
 
06:46:13.670 --> 06:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
brings back to the Forefront that
 
06:46:15.788 --> 06:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
parents are to be respected as their
 
06:46:18.110 --> 06:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
child's protection and nothing should be
 
06:46:19.590 --> 06:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
happening in the school that will harm
 
06:46:21.590 --> 06:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
children and anything of pornographic
 
06:46:23.628 --> 06:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
nature will be dealt with in a strong
 
06:46:25.430 --> 06:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
and intentional manner with the child's
 
06:46:28.350 --> 06:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
safety at utmost importance my question
 
06:46:30.468 --> 06:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
to you is isn't there enough information
 
06:46:32.628 --> 06:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
for children to study without resorting
 
06:46:34.510 --> 06:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
to sexual content that is not
 
06:46:36.468 --> 06:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate for children kids are in
 
06:46:38.468 --> 06:46:38.478 align:start position:0%
school to exercise their brains and to
 
06:46:40.868 --> 06:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
learn how to learn to be educated and
 
06:46:43.110 --> 06:46:43.120 align:start position:0%

06:46:45.830 --> 06:46:45.840 align:start position:0%

06:46:48.590 --> 06:46:48.600 align:start position:0%

06:47:54.628 --> 06:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
2021 I discovered a story of a parent
 
06:47:57.910 --> 06:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
verbalizing the words in details of an
 
06:48:01.388 --> 06:48:01.398 align:start position:0%

state her description of the contents of
 
06:48:12.750 --> 06:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
the book was so graphic and vulgar that
 
06:48:16.510 --> 06:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
the board asked her to stop
 
06:48:19.868 --> 06:48:19.878 align:start position:0%
speaking and was told there are children
 
06:48:21.990 --> 06:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
at the
 
06:48:25.190 --> 06:48:25.200 align:start position:0%

06:48:32.430 --> 06:48:32.440 align:start position:0%

06:48:34.948 --> 06:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
have materials be here in Salem New

these questions was not easy and
 
06:48:53.030 --> 06:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:55.350 --> 06:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
eyeopener I feel that these obscene
 
06:48:57.628 --> 06:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
books are often made easily accessible
 
06:49:00.830 --> 06:49:00.840 align:start position:0%

booklook s.org put that in your notes
 
06:50:47.110 --> 06:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
because I heard other people and just
 
06:50:48.310 --> 06:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
give me a minute please because I've
 
06:50:49.708 --> 06:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
been working on this for like three four
 
06:50:51.750 --> 06:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
years I'm a parent all right and I do
 
06:50:54.510 --> 06:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
this by myself and I'm really tired of
 
06:50:56.830 --> 06:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
the inappropriate nature of what we are
 
06:50:58.708 --> 06:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
battling to some of these wonderful
 
06:51:01.750 --> 06:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
speakers before me uh pointed out that
 
06:51:04.070 --> 06:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is absurd when I was a young a
 
06:51:06.388 --> 06:51:06.398 align:start position:0%
young person at school I went into my
 
06:51:08.310 --> 06:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
library I'm I'm just going to go off the
 
06:51:10.270 --> 06:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
cuff here when I went into my library
 
06:51:13.388 --> 06:51:13.398 align:start position:0%
the extent of this type of concern as a
 
06:51:15.788 --> 06:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
parent was a National Geographic
 
06:51:18.110 --> 06:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
Magazine with a woman breastfeeding her
 
06:51:20.270 --> 06:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
child and yeah I might have Snicker or
 
06:51:22.788 --> 06:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
whatever with my kids but the point is
 
06:51:25.948 --> 06:51:25.958 align:start position:0%
it it's got changed quite a bit in 35 40
 
06:51:29.468 --> 06:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
years okay uh there's a serious problem
 
06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
and that's what I was going to get to
 
06:51:32.948 --> 06:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
I've gone to the school board two three
 
06:51:36.110 --> 06:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
times I removed my son from the school
 
06:51:39.590 --> 06:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
to somebody's point here uh Miss amarie
 
06:51:42.388 --> 06:51:42.398 align:start position:0%
Banfield she's absolutely right I pulled
 
06:51:44.750 --> 06:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
my kid from the school and he he begged
 
06:51:46.590 --> 06:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
me to take him back to the public school
 
06:51:49.468 --> 06:51:49.478 align:start position:0%
for his Christmas wish all right that's
 
06:51:51.548 --> 06:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
all he wanted for
 
06:51:54.110 --> 06:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
Christmas and I work my butt off driving
 
06:51:56.030 --> 06:51:56.040 align:start position:0%

that you know doesn't play games with
 
06:52:01.910 --> 06:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
this type of stuff back to other
 
06:52:03.708 --> 06:52:03.718 align:start position:0%

going to go quickly this was brought to
 
06:53:58.750 --> 06:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
my attention a couple years ago and I
 
06:54:01.350 --> 06:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
too have two children that I adopted
 
06:54:04.628 --> 06:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
that have been sexually abused and we
 
06:54:06.788 --> 06:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
are trying to teach them what is normal
 
06:54:09.670 --> 06:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
and what is not normal we do not need to
 
06:54:13.190 --> 06:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
normalize abuse that is not how you help
 
06:54:13.200 --> 06:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
normalize abuse that is not how you help
a

06:54:13.910 --> 06:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:54:16.030 --> 06:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
victim they need to know what happened
 
06:54:18.110 --> 06:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
to them was not okay so that they don't
 
06:54:21.708 --> 06:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
recycle those behaviors that being said
 
06:54:22.910 --> 06:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
when this was first brought to my
 
06:54:25.150 --> 06:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
attention I quickly said what is the New
 
06:54:27.670 --> 06:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law on child pornography
 
06:54:30.430 --> 06:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
children in sex acts and if you look at
 
06:54:33.030 --> 06:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
649 a colon 3
 
06:54:35.590 --> 06:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
it is anything that is to buy Pro
 
06:54:39.030 --> 06:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
procure process of a child engaging in
 
06:54:42.110 --> 06:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit conduct it is a class
 
06:54:44.830 --> 06:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
a felony I brought that straight to
 
06:54:46.628 --> 06:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
Frank edel and I said how is this not a
 
06:54:48.830 --> 06:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
felony that we have a child who's giving
 
06:54:51.628 --> 06:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
oral sex to an adult in our public
 
06:54:54.190 --> 06:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
school if I'm caught with this material
 
06:54:55.670 --> 06:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's a class a
 
06:54:57.750 --> 06:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
felony and he said trce you're
 
06:55:00.708 --> 06:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely right but there's some sort
 
06:55:03.350 --> 06:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
of exemption for school
 
06:55:05.868 --> 06:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
libraries when they're not accountable
 
06:55:07.788 --> 06:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
to 649
 
06:55:07.798 --> 06:55:09.388 align:start position:0%
to 649
a

06:55:09.388 --> 06:55:09.398 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:55:13.468 --> 06:55:13.478 align:start position:0%
649a colon 3 there's your language and I
 
06:55:15.388 --> 06:55:15.398 align:start position:0%
said that has got to
 
06:55:17.868 --> 06:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
change if any of us is caught with this
 
06:55:20.750 --> 06:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
material it's a class a felony a child
 
06:55:24.868 --> 06:55:24.878 align:start position:0%

engaging in sexually explicit conduct
 
06:55:36.430 --> 06:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
the language is very clear it is not
 
06:55:38.510 --> 06:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
ambiguous why there would ever be an
 
06:55:40.510 --> 06:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
exemption and this material to be
 
06:55:43.110 --> 06:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
